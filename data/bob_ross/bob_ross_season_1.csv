Bob Ross,"- Hi, Im Bob Ross, and for the next 13 weeks, Ill be your host, as we experience The Joy of Painting"
Bob Ross,"I think each of us, sometime during our life, has wanted to paint a picture"
Bob Ross,I think theres an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us
Bob Ross,"And here we will try to show you how to bring that artist out, to put it on canvas"
Bob Ross,"Because you too, can paint almighty pictures"
Bob Ross,"You know, we have avoided painting for so long because I think, all of our lives, weve been told that you have to go to school half of your life, maybe even have to be blessed by Michelangelo at birth to ever be able to paint a picture"
Bob Ross,And here we want to show you that thats not true. That you can paint a picture right along with us
Bob Ross,"Each week well use the same colors, well use the same equipment, so if you have your brush and pallet ready next week, you can paint right along with us"
Bob Ross,Id like to go over some of the equipment that well use before we start. The brushes that we use
Bob Ross,"Ill be using very large, two and a half inch, and one inch, natural bristle brushes"
Bob Ross,Now these are natural bristle. Be sure you dont start with a nylon brush
Bob Ross,Well use an almighty palette knife. And this is much different than the traditional palette knife
Bob Ross,"It is not thin and flimsy, its a firm palette knife"
Bob Ross,And with this we can make fantastic things happen. Lets go over the colors that well use
Bob Ross,"Were gonna start out here with Titanium white, Phthalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red"
Bob Ross,"Now these eight colors, well use each and every week, for every picture that we do"
Bob Ross,So you dont have to go out and buy 1500 different kinds of colors and brushes
Bob Ross,You need very little equipment to paint with this
Bob Ross,"Another thing, well do no tracing of patterns on here"
Bob Ross,"We start with the vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas"
Bob Ross,"And were here to teach you to be able to do this too. So, lets do it"
Bob Ross,Lets paint a picture right here
Bob Ross,"Were gonna to start with a big brush, and were gonna cover the canvas with a thin layer of magic white"
Bob Ross,"Now this is a wet-on-wet technique, so the first thing were going to do is get the canvas wet"
Bob Ross,"And all we want is a nice, even coat of paint here. There we go. Just cover it nice and even"
Bob Ross,You also need an almighty easel when youre doing this
Bob Ross,"You need an easel that will hold your canvas very firm, and allow you to use these big brushes. Okay"
Bob Ross,"When youre using a large brush like this, it really doesnt take too long to cover your canvas"
Bob Ross,"And if you get a hair like that, just pop it off with the corner of your brush, flip it away. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now after you get your canvas covered with a magic white, well take and make long strokes back and forth to get a nice even distribution of paint on here"
Bob Ross,Okay. Up and down one time
Bob Ross,That assures that the magic whites nice and even all the way across the canvas
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets wash the brush out here. We wash our brushes with odorless paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well wash them out. And I beat the brush just to dry the bristles"
Bob Ross,"Now lets take a little bit of Cad yellow here, and I think today well do a picture thats, maybe like were walking through the woods"
Bob Ross,"And so lets start right here with a little bit of Cad yellow, with just the least little touch of Phalo green in it"
Bob Ross,"And well out a little bit more of the green color, and well begin making little Xs, just like so"
Bob Ross,"Just work that around. Okay. Now without cleaning the brush, well go right into some Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,Just add it right onto the brush here. Well just go out here
Bob Ross,"And were making the crisscross strokes, little X strokes. There"
Bob Ross,Already were beginning to have a light source in this painting
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well clean the brush again. Once again, this is odorless paint thinner"
Bob Ross,We do not use turpentine
Bob Ross,"Now with a nice clean brush, Im gonna take and add just a little bit of Titanium white, right here in the center"
Bob Ross,Just a little. And well begin working outward. There
Bob Ross,By now maybe you have recognized some of the equipment were using as something youve seen before
Bob Ross,"And I learned this fantastic technique wonderful man that I think all of us have enjoyed for many many years on TV, Bill Alexander"
Bob Ross,And Bill taught me this many years ago. It is the most fantastic way to paint that youve ever seen
Bob Ross,So join us. Have some fun. And well just blend this out a little bit more here
Bob Ross,"Until we have a nice blue sky. There we go. Okay, well clean the brush one more time"
Bob Ross,Now lets start putting in some almighty trees here
Bob Ross,"Were gonna start with a little bit of Alizarin crimson, and a touch of Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,"Now the Prussian blue is 100 times stronger than the Crimson, so use just a little blue and a lot of Crimson"
Bob Ross,And here were going to begin pushing in basic tree shapes. So just bend the brush. Bend the brush
Bob Ross,Make those little leaves and branches just pop right out at you. There he comes
Bob Ross,These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out
Bob Ross,"This is your world, your creation. Lets put a little one right here"
Bob Ross,And maybe well just put some little grassy areas coming down through here
Bob Ross,"And right there, there is one. Youre pushing quite firm here"
Bob Ross,"This is why I say you need an almighty easel when youre doing this, an easel thats strong. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Maybe over here on this side now, well add another one. Maybe a bigger one over here. There he is"
Bob Ross,"And theres no secret to this, anybody can paint. Anybody can paint"
Bob Ross,"All you need is a dream in your heart, a little practice"
Bob Ross,"There, already we have the beginning of a beautiful picture"
Bob Ross,"We have the tree shapes, the light source. Looks to me like its early in the morning. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets put some trunks on these trees"
Bob Ross,"And for that will take a little bit of Van Dyke brown, and lets just lay in some basic trunks here"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And maybe well put a little limb right here, like so"
Bob Ross,Maybe a little something right there. There we are
Bob Ross,"Okay, now this little fellow over here, he needs a trunk too. So well put one right in here"
Bob Ross,"And maybe some limbs up in here. Right through here, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Just some indications here and there, and some little sticks and twigs. Maybe over here"
Bob Ross,There we are. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now well highlight these, and well take a little bit of white, and a touch of brown mixed together"
Bob Ross,"And remember where your light source is. So this tree, well highlight right here. Like so"
Bob Ross,There we are
Bob Ross,"Now over on this side, the lights coming through here, so well highlight this side of it"
Bob Ross,Maybe a few little indications up through here. Now comes the fun
Bob Ross,"Now we can begin putting all the beautiful leaves and stuff on this, and just really make it come alive"
Bob Ross,"So here, well take a little bit of the magic white, to thin our paint"
Bob Ross,"One of the golden rules in this, this is a thin paint, well stick to a thick paint"
Bob Ross,"So anytime youre painting over the top of paint, you need to have a paint thats just a little bit thinner"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit of Phalo green and a little bit of yellow, and we load the brush full of paint"
Bob Ross,"And out lights coming through here, so we want the side of the tree to be a little brighter than the other side"
Bob Ross,All right. And then we begin pushing thousands of little leaves on here. They hide in your brush
Bob Ross,"There they come. Just a little on this side over here, because not as much lights gonna strike"
Bob Ross,"A littles come through, but not as much. And look at that"
Bob Ross,"In just a matter of a few minutes, we have a beautiful tree"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe, this little tree over here, well put a little highlight on him"
Bob Ross,"And once again, were using a paint thats a little bit thinner, so that it sticks"
Bob Ross,"First thing that you have to do when youre doing this is start with an oil paint thats very, very firm"
Bob Ross,Your base paint has to be extremely firm
Bob Ross,"If you start with a thin, loose paint, your gonna become a mud mixer"
Bob Ross,You have to have a thick paint on the base coat in order to get this thinner paint to stick
Bob Ross,"Now lets begin building some bushes and stuff in here. All right, look at that"
Bob Ross,"You can do it, I know you can. There, look there"
Bob Ross,Okay lets move to this big tree in the front here and lets put some nice little leaves up here on him
Bob Ross,You have to bend that brush
Bob Ross,"If the brush doesnt bend, youre not gonna get all these beautiful little leaves, these little actions that happen"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe theres a nice little bush that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"You know if youve ever walked through the woods early in the morning, all the little creatures are out here"
Bob Ross,Theyre all playing in the bushes and stuff. This is where they live. In all these bushes
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets put something on this side now. Nice little bush here"
Bob Ross,Just let your imagination run wild. Let your heart be your guide
Bob Ross,"In the time you sit around worrying about it, trying to plan out painting, you could have completed a painting already"
Bob Ross,"Let it happen, let it happen"
Bob Ross,"You know for so many years I was a traditional painter, and I would spend sometimes weeks just working on a picture, drawing it out, getting all the little sketches and stuff"
Bob Ross,And then Id go back and spend maybe a month trying to fill in the blocks
Bob Ross,"And here, we let it happen. It comes right out of here, its in you. And you put it on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets see. Lets try this big ole tree here, put some nice little leaves on him. There we go"
Bob Ross,Yeah. Mmm
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets try, Ive added a little permanent red with my color now, just to give us a little different value"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and you know if were going to walk through the woods, we need a little path"
Bob Ross,"So lets take a little bit of Van Dyke brown here, and lets build us a happy little path"
Bob Ross,Were just gonna take the knife and let this path sort of just wander right down through here
Bob Ross,"There we go, just let it wander round, play and have fun. Okay, there we got us a nice little path"
Bob Ross,"Now we need to highlight that path so Ill take just a little bit of white, and well just take it and barely touch the canvas here"
Bob Ross,"Just enough so we can highlight where the suns sparkling through here. There, see how easy that is"
Bob Ross,Let the paint break
Bob Ross,"And now in order to set the path down into the painting, well add some bushes that project up over the path here and there"
Bob Ross,Push em in. There we go. And you can see how that makes it literally drop right into the painting
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets put some more land aries in here. Maybe this nice little areas coming down through here"
Bob Ross,Just like so. Maybe well have some over here. Follow the angle of your land
Bob Ross,"There we go, there we go"
Bob Ross,"There, now maybe, maybe, maybe, as were walking through the woods here, maybe it rained last night"
Bob Ross,Maybe it came a nice little rain. Theres little puddles
Bob Ross,You know after it rains you always have little rain puddles
Bob Ross,"So lets take a little touch of the Prussian blue here, and well just make us a little puddle"
Bob Ross,"And we put some Prussian blue on the brush, and we take here and pull downward"
Bob Ross,"Just pull downward like so. There we go. Okay, see how easy it is to do. Now"
Bob Ross,"Very gently, well come across this way. Just to give it a watery effect"
Bob Ross,"Now if you want to, if you wanna put highlights in here, maybe you could take just a little touch of the Titanium white on your brush, and pull down"
Bob Ross,Itll give it sort of a sheen
Bob Ross,There and then once again just come across just enough to give it a nice watery feel
Bob Ross,"You can overdo this part very easily. Okay, wash off the ole brush"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we can take a little more of the Van Dyke brown and we can just make little puddles out of this"
Bob Ross,"Maybe it comes down like so, right through there. There we are. Okay, little puddle"
Bob Ross,And we just make this a little separate puddle back here. Just like that
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we take a little bit of brown and white, and well lay a little highlight on there"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And in your world, you can do anything that your heart desires"
Bob Ross,"My home is in Fairbanks, Alaska, and I spend a lot of time walking around the woods and talking to trees and squirrels and little rabbits and stuff"
Bob Ross,And I look at a lot of nature
Bob Ross,"And if painting teaches you nothing else, itll teach you to look at nature with different eyes"
Bob Ross,"Itll teach you to see things that have been there all your life, and youve never noticed"
Bob Ross,"And if it does nothing else but make you enjoy nature, its worthwhile"
Bob Ross,"So look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere. You only have to look to see it"
Bob Ross,"Okay, I talk too much sometimes so well go back to painting here"
Bob Ross,"Take a little bit of the thin white paint here, and well put some little water lines back in here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, just like so. There we go. There, and maybe some little water lines right here"
Bob Ross,This is just a thin white paint and you literally just cut right into the canvas with it
Bob Ross,And lets smooth that out. There we go
Bob Ross,"Okay, now while I have the knife here, Im gonna take it and just cut a few little sticks here and there"
Bob Ross,And all were doing is just literally cutting right through the paint
Bob Ross,"So the canvas shows through and it makes a multitude of little sticks, and these little sticks help create the illusion of distance in a painting"
Bob Ross,All different planes
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then, lets put some bushes and stuff right down here on the grass, on this soil area"
Bob Ross,"There we go. There they are, there they are. They just live right here in your brush"
Bob Ross,"And you just drop em right in. There. Okay, now lets take and do this"
Bob Ross,"Lets put some land right down through here. Back to the Van Dyke brown, little bit of white"
Bob Ross,There we go. Well add a little highlight on here. There
Bob Ross,And well put a few little bushes and stuff right out here. See how easy that is
Bob Ross,"Okay, a few more little water lines in there. Just let em happen"
Bob Ross,"Each week, well try to do paintings that are designed to teach you something different, something new, something exciting"
Bob Ross,Just to keep your interest going. Okay now lets play a little bit here
Bob Ross,Lets have a happy little tree right in here
Bob Ross,"So well start with the Van Dyke brown, and well make his little trunk here. There he goes"
Bob Ross,Straight Van Dyke brown to start with
Bob Ross,There and we just turn him out to give him little foots to stand on. There
Bob Ross,And maybe he needs another little arm out here. So well just give him one
Bob Ross,"This is your creation, you can do anything here that you want to do. Just let it happen. There"
Bob Ross,"Now, and well give him some little leaves, and well use some more of the Alizarin crimson, a touch of Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and we need dark in order to show light. So first well put some dark on here"
Bob Ross,Ill put some happy little leaves here and there
Bob Ross,"When we see you next week I hope you have your almighty easels set up, the colors ready, your big brushes all primed and ready to go, and do an almighty painting with us here"
Bob Ross,"Very quickly while Im finishing this up Ill go over the colors, one more time, that we use"
Bob Ross,"Titanium white, Phthalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red"
Bob Ross,Only eight colors that you need
Bob Ross,Okay now lets put some highlights on this pretty little tree right here
Bob Ross,"Mmm, I used just a little touch more of the Permanent red on this one so hell stand out a little more"
Bob Ross,See how easy it is to create a tree right here in your world. There we go
Bob Ross,"And maybe down here, maybe theres some nice little bushes and stuff happening right in here"
Bob Ross,"There we go. All right, maybe right there another one"
Bob Ross,"Okay, here and there Im gonna put just a few little sticks and stuff. Like that"
Bob Ross,"Just, once again, to build some distance in here. We want this to have a lot of depth in it"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well cut in a few little sticks here and there, like so. You gettin excited yet"
Bob Ross,You ready to paint with us. You can do it
Bob Ross,"Okay, and I think this paintings far enough along, well just sign this rascal"
Bob Ross,"And I sign the painting with a script liner brush, a little bit of oil, and I use red paint, but whatever color you prefer"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and well just sign that rascal. I hope youve enjoyed this painting"
Bob Ross,Next week were looking forward to seeing you. I hope you have your brush ready
Bob Ross,A dream in your heart that you want to put on canvas
Bob Ross,"And join us, right here, at The Joy of Painting, and you too can build fantastic pictures"
Bob Ross,"You can take em from here, and put em on there"
Bob Ross,"Until next week, happy painting, from all of us here. slow acoustic guitar"
Bob Ross,"- Hello, glad to see you again. Thought today wed do a picture thats right straight out of Alaska"
Bob Ross,"Well do one of Mount McKinley, the most almighty mountain in the North American continent"
Bob Ross,"And well start off today, and we use just a little bit of Prussian blue, maybe a touch of phthalo green mixed with it here"
Bob Ross,And lets dance in some basic shapes here
Bob Ross,Ive already put the Magic White on the canvas to save a little time
Bob Ross,"So were just literally mixing color right here on the canvas, just let this brush dance and play and have fun"
Bob Ross,"And all were looking for is general basic cloud shapes here, were really not trying to put anything in"
Bob Ross,"Just let it happen. Just move the brush, keep it moving, working, playing, having fun, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that something. There we are. Put a nice little cloud shape right there, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"Okay, keep the brush moving, dont let it stop"
Bob Ross,"And sometimes brush is lazy, you have to really push it a little or itll quit on you"
Bob Ross,"Make it keep moving. Okay, now well take the almighty brush here, and were gonna swirl this"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna pull the color, move it, pull it, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Try to avoid a pattern, we want this to go everywhere"
Bob Ross,"Were looking for a sky here that has life in it, has movement in it, we dont want a sky that looks like at night you pull the curtain down and everything went black on you"
Bob Ross,"Wanna keep this moving, there"
Bob Ross,Already youre beginning to see all the little things happening up here. Every which direction
Bob Ross,"Every way, there we go. Now you can blend this too much and take it all out"
Bob Ross,"We dont wanna take it out, we just wanna mix it up. Stir it up"
Bob Ross,"Okay, while weve got some paint on the brush here, well add a little more Prussian blue and phthalo green"
Bob Ross,And well put us in some water. We pull from the outside in
Bob Ross,"And leave a little area opened here, that will create the little sheen of light that plays across the water"
Bob Ross,"You can go back with white paint and put it back in, but youve already covered the canvas with Magic White, so why not use it"
Bob Ross,"This is a lazy mans way of painting. You let the paint work, you let the brushes work"
Bob Ross,"Use what happens naturally, dont fight it"
Bob Ross,"Okay, clean the old brush off, and lets get out an almighty fan brush here"
Bob Ross,And lets build some happy little clouds up here
Bob Ross,Im gonna take titanium white with the least little touch of permanent red in it
Bob Ross,"And load the brush full of paint, just really load it up"
Bob Ross,"Now well start working on some basic cloud shapes here, and well dance in all these little areas and let em just play in the sky"
Bob Ross,"Keep the brush moving, keep it moving. You want areas that are thick, areas that are thin"
Bob Ross,Let all these little things happen
Bob Ross,"And well take the big brush here and gently, gently blend this together. Very lightly"
Bob Ross,And fluff it up a little and hypnotize it
Bob Ross,"And right there youve got an almighty cloud, just that quick"
Bob Ross,"But theyre very easily killed, clouds are delicate. Dont overwork it, put it in, leave it alone"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and maybe well have another one here. Well put a, layer these clouds some. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Nature is so beautiful, just let it go, have fun with it. Very, very easy to work these to death"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well blend this in"
Bob Ross,"And you work in layers here, you do thing thats the farthest away first, have him finished, and then work forward"
Bob Ross,"There, well hypnotize that one, blend this one a little bit. Okay, little bit more red here"
Bob Ross,There we go. Dont wanna set these clouds on fire now
Bob Ross,"All we wanna do is have a slight warmish glow to em, like the suns playing along the top"
Bob Ross,There we go. Guess we better not forget this side of the sky. Well put a little something over here
Bob Ross,"Just some nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Okay, and mix these up a little bit"
Bob Ross,"lively piano music Okay, maybe a little streaky one right here. Got baby clouds, too"
Bob Ross,"If you didnt have baby clouds, you wouldnt have big clouds"
Bob Ross,"There, and we can work on this one a little touch. Okay, there looks like a nice place"
Bob Ross,And were really pushing this paint into the canvas. Were working that value right into the canvas
Bob Ross,Just let it play. Dont kill all the dark areas
Bob Ross,You can end up with great big cotton balls in the sky if youre not careful
Bob Ross,"Guess thatd be considered a UFO, big cotton ball in the sky. There, fluff that up"
Bob Ross,And work that paint
Bob Ross,"And look at there, in just a couple of minutes, you have a sky that has so much action happening in it"
Bob Ross,"There we go, okay"
Bob Ross,"banging If you do this in your living room, you can redecorate your living room in a matter of minutes, so be very careful, learn to control it"
Bob Ross,"Have you a box you can shake your brush in, and that way you dont have to worry about covering everything"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets take a little bit of brown, some blue, a little touch of alizarin crimson and some white"
Bob Ross,"There we go, and dont mix your paint dead. Mix it marbley and leave it alone"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets do, since were gonna do McKinley today, lets do the basic shape here"
Bob Ross,"McKinley comes down like so, has another peak running right off through here"
Bob Ross,"Make that just a little more rounded. There, and we let this side drop right down and over"
Bob Ross,"All youre looking for here is the basic outline, the basic shape of this mountain"
Bob Ross,"Youre not worried at all what happens in here. Okay, take the big brush, and well pull that down"
Bob Ross,This takes off the excess paint and makes the next layer stick better
Bob Ross,"And also when youre doing mountains, if you can see the entire mountain, the top of the mountain is always more distinct than the bottom"
Bob Ross,"At the bottom of the mountain we have mist, and now we have pollution"
Bob Ross,We have a multitude of things that break up and diffuse light
Bob Ross,"Okay, and well put some snow on that almighty mountain"
Bob Ross,"Pull that paint out real flat, just pull it out and get us a little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,And well just lay this on and let it travel right on down
Bob Ross,"And you want the paint to break like this, to make all the little things that happen in there, the little shadows, the light and dark areas"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and theres a little bump that comes out right there and works its way down"
Bob Ross,"And over here, let this drop just like so. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now for the shadow color, well use a little Prussian blue and white"
Bob Ross,"And once again, dont mix it dead. You want it to be sort of marbley"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well start with the shadows, and well just lay these in here"
Bob Ross,We wanna bring these two areas here together
Bob Ross,"So we just sorta work it back and forth and let it come, there you go, let it just come together"
Bob Ross,And maybe this shadow comes right down through here. Every highlight needs its own private shadow
Bob Ross,"Okay, well put a little shadow right there. And see how that protrudes that up"
Bob Ross,Makes it just jump right out at you. The little ridges here and there
Bob Ross,All kind of little things happening in this mountain
Bob Ross,And we need a shadow back here behind this almighty peak. There it is. Just let him go
Bob Ross,"Okay, and we want a peak that comes right up through here and just begins working its way back down"
Bob Ross,lively piano music There. Its a nice ridge coming through here. And we can bring these together
Bob Ross,lively piano music A few little shadows in here. Just here and there. Okay
Bob Ross,"And as we say, we want this to be more distinct at the top than the bottom, so were gonna diffuse the bottom of it, and only the bottom"
Bob Ross,"And here were just tapping the canvas. Were trying not to destroy, only diffuse"
Bob Ross,And this is where you really depend on a firm paint
Bob Ross,"If you have a loose, oily, thin paint, you become a mud mixer here"
Bob Ross,"So when you try this at home, if you find that youre making a lot of mud, check your paint, it should be very, very firm"
Bob Ross,"Squeeze that tube, it should stand up maybe about three-quarters of an inch above the tube"
Bob Ross,"Then you have a nice firm paint. Okay, Im gonna make the same color and make it darker"
Bob Ross,"Blue, brown, and alizarin added to it. Cause I want this mountain to be in front"
Bob Ross,"This is a beautiful study of how to make one mountain look very, very big"
Bob Ross,And well put some little smaller mountains here in the foreground
Bob Ross,"lively piano music Okay, another little peak here. And well take the big brush and pull that out"
Bob Ross,"Son of a gun, this comes right out. Thats the beauty of painting wet on wet"
Bob Ross,You can move paint on the canvas. And well put some happy little snow here. Just let that run
Bob Ross,There we go. Okay
Bob Ross,"Our light is still coming from the same direction here, so dont let that fool you"
Bob Ross,"lively piano music Okay, now we can work in some shadows here"
Bob Ross,"Lets push that one into the background, just come right on through, and thatll push him back"
Bob Ross,"Its scary to have this much power that you can move mountains. Okay, this, there"
Bob Ross,We can swing this around and bring these two right together
Bob Ross,"Just make a nice little ridge out of that. Okay, now weve got an almighty mountain"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little of the blue, brown, alizarin crimson, add a little touch of sap green to it"
Bob Ross,"Looking for a dark color here, very dark"
Bob Ross,"I will load up this one-inch brush, and well push in some little dark areas here"
Bob Ross,"Thisll be our little trees that are way, way back in the distance, bushes and trees and all the little things happening back here"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Now with the big brush, we can pull a little bit of this color down"
Bob Ross,And thisll be the beginning of our reflections
Bob Ross,"Okay, and well just give it a little bit of ripple to make it look watery"
Bob Ross,"banging Okay, lets put some highlights on here"
Bob Ross,Im gonna use a little bit of Magic White mixed with some cad yellow. Little touch of permanent red
Bob Ross,"And well just sorta go back and forth, make a nice orangey color here, bright color. Mm"
Bob Ross,"There we go, all these nice little bushes happening back here"
Bob Ross,lively piano music And then well reflect some of that right down into the water here. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now with a big brush and the most delicate, delicate touch possible, just enough to pull the paint a little bit, well pull that down and just give it a watery effect, dont wanna destroy it"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets take"
Bob Ross,"mix up a lot of dark here, blue, brown, alizarin, and a little bit of sap green"
Bob Ross,"Should look black to you. And well load the brush full of paint, load it full. A lot of paint"
Bob Ross,And lets make some little evergreen trees that are growing way back here in the distance
Bob Ross,lively piano music Okay. Lets firm that one up a little bit. It needs to be a little stronger
Bob Ross,There we go. Maybe hes got a friend that lives right over here. Just dropped him in
Bob Ross,"lively piano music Okay, maybe theyre getting a little bigger as it comes around the curve"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little baby one back here. Okay, well put a little bush in front of him"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well take a little touch of Magic White, a little bit of brown, and a little touch of yellow just to make a nice sandy looking color"
Bob Ross,And well lay in a little water line back here. There we go
Bob Ross,And well cut in a few little trunks and sticks here and there. scraping Okay
Bob Ross,"Maybe we need another tree right here. Trees are getting closer, so theyre getting a little bigger"
Bob Ross,"They look bigger to you, this is the way we push everything back. Work with perspective here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets move to the other side of the picture while weve got a brush full of paint here, and well put an almighty tree right here"
Bob Ross,"These trees live in your brush. You have to scare em out sometimes, really work at em"
Bob Ross,Little son of a guns will try to avoid you. And theyre like everything else
Bob Ross,"The first time you try em, theyre gonna drive you up the wall. But you practice it"
Bob Ross,"If theres a secret to this, it is practice"
Bob Ross,"You learn how to make the brush work, how to touch the canvas with it"
Bob Ross,"And then its just a matter of practicing. First time you tied your shoe, it wasnt easy"
Bob Ross,You had to look at it and work at it
Bob Ross,"The next thing you know, youre not paying any attention, you just, you get your shoe tied"
Bob Ross,"Same thing. Okay, well just"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well make another little projection come right out through here, there we go"
Bob Ross,A little reflection in here. And well pull that down
Bob Ross,"lively piano music Okay, well lay in some more of these pretty colors back here"
Bob Ross,"Theres a nice little bush right there. Mm, theres one"
Bob Ross,"And right down here well reflect some of these. Okay, delicate touch again, very, very light"
Bob Ross,Just enough to move it a little bit on the wet canvas
Bob Ross,And well put some land out here so these bushes have a place to sit
Bob Ross,"Dont want em fall off in the river here, so well give em something to set on here"
Bob Ross,And we can take a clean brush and just lift that gently
Bob Ross,"This is a very thin paint now, its mostly Magic White"
Bob Ross,So you can move that without destroying whats underneath it
Bob Ross,"And here well use a little bit of just straight Magic White, and well put us a happy little water line in here"
Bob Ross,"There. Okay. Now then, you can, you can put some more little bushes right in here like so"
Bob Ross,And well drop some reflections into the water. And well pull those down
Bob Ross,"And anybody can do this, this is not some big secret thing"
Bob Ross,"Anybody can do it, we teach people from the age of 10 all the way up 80 and 90 years old"
Bob Ross,"banging And young people really, really like this"
Bob Ross,"They learn it very easily, very quickly, and they see results very quickly"
Bob Ross,"I have a son thats a young man right now, and he was, oh, hes been painting since he was about 12 years old, been selling his work"
Bob Ross,So its not just for the older person. It will also work very well for the young person
Bob Ross,"The only trouble, like my son, hes quite lazy. Hell only paint if he needs money"
Bob Ross,"If he needs money, hell paint. But it is a nice way to put a happy buck in your pocket"
Bob Ross,And to make good things happen in your heart
Bob Ross,"Okay, well just have this come right on down through here. Fill that in"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we can start highlighting some of these things"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit of blue and yellow mixed together, make a very nice little green color here"
Bob Ross,And well just drop some highlights on this tree. Remember where your lights coming from
Bob Ross,"Lights coming from the right, so you want the right-hand side of this tree to be a little more distinct and bright than the left side"
Bob Ross,"And if youre right handed, youll probably find its easier to have the light coming from the right"
Bob Ross,"If youre left handed, it will sort of vary from person to person. Okay"
Bob Ross,Lets put some little highlights over here on these little trees. The sun wouldnt forget them
Bob Ross,There we go. lively piano music There we are now
Bob Ross,"A little more Magic White, thin that down just a touch"
Bob Ross,And we can start finding all these beautiful little trees and bushes that are living in here
Bob Ross,Very important that you dont kill all this dark area
Bob Ross,"If you kill all the dark, your pictures gonna be very flat"
Bob Ross,"Well, we might as well reflect that right into the water there. Okay, and there we go"
Bob Ross,"A little bit right in here. And well reflect that right on down, a little touch of red over the top"
Bob Ross,"Okay, theres another nice tree I see"
Bob Ross,"Little rascals live in your brush, you just gotta push em out"
Bob Ross,"And lets put a touch more of the Magic here. There, nice ochre color"
Bob Ross,"All these pretty little bushes, just let em flow off your brush"
Bob Ross,And some little grassy areas coming down through here. Lets turn that into a nice reflection
Bob Ross,"Just like so. Okay, now lets give him a little bit of dirt. There we go"
Bob Ross,This is straight van dyke brown
Bob Ross,"And onto that, well take a little brown and white and give him just a little touch of highlight, make him look like little stones and rocks playing through here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets put a few little sticks here and there"
Bob Ross,Here were just cutting through the paint using the point of the knife
Bob Ross,"But it shows distance, it shows all these different planes. Okay"
Bob Ross,And well put just a little bit of Magic White under here and give us a little water line
Bob Ross,"lively piano music There we go, and a few little sticks over here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, but you see what you can do in just a few minutes with an almighty brush and an almighty knife and a beautiful painting in your heart"
Bob Ross,All you have to do is let it out. A few more sticks
Bob Ross,"There we go, I think well call that finished, and I wanna thank you very, very much for watching us"
Bob Ross,"I hope to see you again in the near future. Until then, happy painting, thank you"
Bob Ross,light guitar music
Bob Ross,- Hello again. Glad to see you. Thought today wed one of these almighty black canvases
Bob Ross,Its time we got into doing something on a black canvas
Bob Ross,"Id like to show you how you can do a beautiful, beautiful landscape on a black canvas"
Bob Ross,"Ive already went ahead, because we are short of time on this show, Ive already went ahead and covered the whole canvas with Alizarin crimson"
Bob Ross,"Now Im gonna take a little Van Dyke brown and work into the edges, just around the edges, so its, we already have it covered with Alizarin crimson, and now were putting a little brown on it"
Bob Ross,The whole canvas was covered with crimson. There we go. Just around the corners
Bob Ross,Thought today wed do a beautiful little sunset
Bob Ross,And maybe well have a little sunset like the suns going down behind the hill back there
Bob Ross,"And we just have a beautiful glow in the sky, and then well go from there"
Bob Ross,"Now Im gonna take and pull this back and forth to a get a nice even distribution of paint, working it up and down, back and forth"
Bob Ross,There we go. All right
Bob Ross,"Mm kay, now well start with a one-inch brush, well use a little bit of cad yellow"
Bob Ross,"Figure out where the sun is, just went down, and were gonna start like right here"
Bob Ross,And begin working this paint around
Bob Ross,"You start in the center and work around and around and around, and already its picking up the Alizarin crimson and its turning into a beautiful little yellow-ish orange-ish glow here"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And well start right here, let it work outward"
Bob Ross,You want it to get darker and darker and darker and darker as it goes out toward the edges
Bob Ross,So we always start with a color in here and work outward. There we go. Okay
Bob Ross,"A little bit of color here, work it out, and Im doing this in little-bitty X patterns"
Bob Ross,"Back and forth, back and forth, there we go. Mm kay"
Bob Ross,"Now lets take the big brush, and gently gently hypnotize this. Were still making the little Xs"
Bob Ross,There. Just work that in. And then just enough to take out the brushstrokes. Okay
Bob Ross,"water sloshing paintbrush rattling Okay, lets take a little bit of Alizarin, a little brown, put it together here on the brush, mix on the brush"
Bob Ross,And maybe back here in the distance well have a little foothill back here
Bob Ross,Just let this brush bounce along and play. There we go
Bob Ross,Dont let the size of this big brush scare you. It does fantastic things. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now, maybe well have some highlights"
Bob Ross,"Take the little yellow and green and, little touch of red here, and we just push some little highlights coming down here"
Bob Ross,Well make these little foothills way back in the distance. Okay. Lets put some back over here
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"Then well take a clean brush, and just gently lift up, very very lightly, just enough to give it an upward swirl"
Bob Ross,"There. Very light, barely barely touching the canvas. You let two or three hairs just about touch"
Bob Ross,Just enough to move the paint a little bit. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now well take a little yellow and a little permanent red mixed together here, and well start putting in some reflections"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well have a little, have a little lake right back here, a little pond"
Bob Ross,Just lay a little color on. And pull this down. There we go
Bob Ross,Then just enough to give a little watery effect. Just ripple it a little. We dont want to destroy
Bob Ross,"water sloshing Mm kay. brush rattling Clean the old brushes here, and well move right along"
Bob Ross,Okay now Im gonna go back into this brown and Alizarin. Once again were mixing it on the brush
Bob Ross,A lot of paint on the brush. Maybe well put a little tree standing back here
Bob Ross,Well make this one with the fan brush. There we go
Bob Ross,"And trees get lonely too, so well give him a friend. There"
Bob Ross,And maybe theres a little one right there
Bob Ross,"Got two big ones, so, invariably sooner or later theres gonna be a little one. There he is"
Bob Ross,"Lets fill him in, make him just a touch darker. Maybe well put a third one right there"
Bob Ross,"Work that in a little bit, create a shadow behind the tree. Okay"
Bob Ross,"water sloshing Now, well just, with a knife here well just make a little waterline running back through here"
Bob Ross,"These black canvases, we cover with a black acrylic"
Bob Ross,"A flat black acrylic paint, and allow it to dry before we start"
Bob Ross,"And the Alizarin crimson that we use here, is a transparent color, so the black shows through"
Bob Ross,"It looks black, but when you apply color to it, man it really comes alive"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets start with some almighty trees and stuff. Well use the big brush today"
Bob Ross,And lets have a big old tree right here
Bob Ross,I know this may be quite difficult for you to see but we are putting the general shape of the tree right here
Bob Ross,These black canvases make some of the prettiest pictures that you could imagine
Bob Ross,"And if youre interested in selling paintings and making a happy buck to put in your pocket, these are the ones that really sell"
Bob Ross,"Lets have another tree right over here. Let these limbs just fly out, firemen"
Bob Ross,Maybe a big tree up here
Bob Ross,"And as you can see, were really hitting this canvas, were really pushing the paint into it"
Bob Ross,You need an almighty easel. Little Tiny Tim easels will let you down
Bob Ross,This easel is made out of a platform step-ladder. And they work very very well
Bob Ross,"Theyre very strong, very simple to build. Okay. Weve got that filled in"
Bob Ross,Lets put some tree trunks here and there. Okay. And well put some dark paint right along here
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"Just, in your mind, wherever you visualize there might be a little trunk, just drop one in"
Bob Ross,"Now mix just a little brown and white, so we can put a little touch of highlight on this and make it stand out a little, like a lights playing through here and touching it"
Bob Ross,"There. And well put a trunk right over in this one, too. Little dabble. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now, if the suns here, lights coming from this direction, this would be highlighted on the other side"
Bob Ross,"Now probably in reality, if the sky was this dark, you would have nothing but silhouettes"
Bob Ross,But that would be a boring picture. This is a lot more fun
Bob Ross,"Okay, you take a little bit of magic white, little yellow, maybe a touch of Phthalo green"
Bob Ross,And we can put some nice little leaves on all these little bushes
Bob Ross,Look how that color stands out against this black background. It just jumps out at you
Bob Ross,"Okay, now, lets, lets put some on this little bush"
Bob Ross,"And theres some little things growing down in here. Use your imagination, let it go. Let it go"
Bob Ross,"Remember, this is your world. In your world you can create anything that you desire"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets do this old big tree here"
Bob Ross,"Whats so very nice about these black canvases, if theres a light shining directly on them they look totally different than if theyre without a light"
Bob Ross,So in essence its almost like having two paintings in one
Bob Ross,"Especially if you hang these, after theyre finished, over a light, so at night if you turn the light on it shines up on this, its remarkable what happens"
Bob Ross,There we go. All the little bushy areas. Maybe some little touches out here. Okay
Bob Ross,Now lets take some more Van Dyke brown and lets put an almighty tree right here
Bob Ross,"Well just let him bend and play and work right on up to here. And, there we go. There"
Bob Ross,Have another little limb coming down through here
Bob Ross,And maybe theres some little things happening up here in the leaves
Bob Ross,And well have a little light playing across here
Bob Ross,"Just pull that knife sort of, swirled, so it gives the appearance of it being round. There we go"
Bob Ross,Now were ready to put some highlights on these little leaves out here. Okay
Bob Ross,And just let the light play through this tree. Leaving a lot of dark areas
Bob Ross,We need these dark areas to make the tree look round. Dont kill em all
Bob Ross,"Such a, such a temptation, to do a little bit more"
Bob Ross,"I used to work with one art teacher, that, he had a set of handcuffs that hung in the studio, and hed walk by and hed bump you and hed point at those handcuffs"
Bob Ross,"And that was his way of saying, Youre beginning to fiddle it to death"
Bob Ross,"We dont have any handcuffs here today, but stand back and look every once in a while"
Bob Ross,"Dont overwork your picture, youll fiddle it to death. Okay"
Bob Ross,"This looks like a super place, maybe, to have a little path that runs up through there"
Bob Ross,"So now take a little Prussian blue and Van Dyke brown and just very easy here, well just make a little path that runs right through this"
Bob Ross,Got to have a way to get around the lake to catch that big trout that lives out there
Bob Ross,Know hes there. Okay. Then well put just a little bit of highlight on there
Bob Ross,Just let that run down through there and break. You want that paint to break
Bob Ross,So it leaves some of those beautiful dark areas in there. There we go. Now
Bob Ross,Little bit more magic white here
Bob Ross,Just want to thin that paint so itll stick on top of all the other paint. Now we can start in here
Bob Ross,Well start putting some nice little bushes that are hanging over the path
Bob Ross,So the path just disappears back here behind the big tree. Okay
Bob Ross,"And these bushes protruding up over the top, push it down into the picture. You need em"
Bob Ross,They pay you great dividends. And well put some on this side of the road over there. Mm kay
Bob Ross,Lets make another big tree. Maybe right up through here. Well just have a big ol tree
Bob Ross,There he goes. Van Dyke brown
Bob Ross,"Van Dyke browns a very nice color, its almost like a chocolate brown, very warm. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now a little limb right there"
Bob Ross,"Now one thing Id like to mention while were putting the highlights on here, if you have questions or comments or anything youd lie to know about what were doing here, please feel free to drop us a line, care WMVT, and well give you the address at the end of the show"
Bob Ross,"And do use it, so you know, were here to help you, if you have problems or if you have questions, anything concerning this method of painting, well be glad to work with you and try to help you"
Bob Ross,"Okay. Well put some highlights up here on this one. Little bit more of the magic, thin it down"
Bob Ross,Just a touch. Okay. Thousands and thousands and thousands of little leaves
Bob Ross,"Okay, now, lets go down here, put some little things around the tree"
Bob Ross,"And maybe you can, right here, say, lets put a little stone"
Bob Ross,Maybe a little stone just lays right along here. Of course hes a happy little stone
Bob Ross,We dont have any other kind. And well make up a little highlight color. Just lay right over there
Bob Ross,"Like so. Okay, now lets put some, mm, nice one there. Nice one there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets have some little bushes right along in here"
Bob Ross,"Now when youre doing this, load this brush by pulling it in one direction so that it looks like an old shoe on the end, sort of hangs over"
Bob Ross,"You put that round part to the top, and tilt the brush sort of downward and just push, just enough to bend the bristles a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Dont fight it, let the brush do the work. You have the fun, let the brush work"
Bob Ross,Maybe well put a nice little sparkler right there. Just sort of to break that up a little it. Okay
Bob Ross,Now lets lay in a few stems here and there
Bob Ross,"And all were doing here is literally just cutting right through the paint, using the point of the knife"
Bob Ross,We literally just cut the paint. There we go
Bob Ross,This is one of the paintings that we do in class quite frequently
Bob Ross,"Its a very effective painting, it teaches you how to use black canvases. Its a lot of fun"
Bob Ross,"And its extremely, extremely effective. Well have a few little sticks coming over like so"
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"And once again, these little twigs and these little sticks show different planes in the picture"
Bob Ross,It produces the illusion of distance. Use em to your advantage
Bob Ross,Cause the woods are always full of them
Bob Ross,"Lets see, maybe back here we could just put a little indication of a trunk here and there, some little sticks"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Okay. All righty, I think this ones just about ready. Then we can sign it"
Bob Ross,So Ill use a very thin oil here
Bob Ross,"And well just take and use the liner brush, and you mix this paint until its like water"
Bob Ross,"And if you mix it very very thin, curl that brush as you pull it out, twist it, so it brings it to a point"
Bob Ross,Its just like you were writing. You dont have to wait until the painting is dry. Okay. There
Bob Ross,"water sloshing This same technique is also very good if you want to put some nice little sticks and limbs in that you wanted to draw in, use the oil to get the paint thin"
Bob Ross,"And then maybe we could come right across and, cause a thin paint will stick to a thick paint"
Bob Ross,There. Just let these little things happen here and there. Okay
Bob Ross,"One of the things that were trying to do as we travel around and teach this almighty method, is were trying to gather up an army of teachers"
Bob Ross,"And soon well have teachers that travel this entire beautiful country, teaching this fantastic method of painting"
Bob Ross,"If you would like to have some information, drop us a line"
Bob Ross,"Once again, well show you the address at the end of the show"
Bob Ross,And soon well have information on teachers that are all the way across this country
Bob Ross,Teachers that we can guarantee that can teach this fantastic method. Okay
Bob Ross,"I think now, well just put a couple little things here and there. Put another little stick or two"
Bob Ross,I hope youve painted along with us and youve enjoyed this half as much as we have
Bob Ross,"We really enjoy doing these black canvases, they are extremely, extremely effective, and youll find that they bring a nice warm glow to your heart"
Bob Ross,These can be done in a multitude of colors. You can cover em with any color thats transparent
Bob Ross,"We can use the Prussian blue, sap green, any of these colors, or combinations of colors"
Bob Ross,Later on in this series well do a winter picture on a black canvas and Ill show you how you can put the moon in the sky and let the light play across the snow when you have the almighty mountains and stuff
Bob Ross,And Ill think youll find these black canvases can do fantastic things
Bob Ross,We also wanna do some pictures in the series where we paint the canvas with one color
Bob Ross,"Instead of putting the magic white on the canvas, well paint it, for example, the sap green"
Bob Ross,And well paint beautiful pictures by doing that
Bob Ross,"Theres a multitude of things that can be done with this. Use it, experiment with it, go with it"
Bob Ross,Just let your heart be your guide. Let your imagination take you anywhere that you want to go
Bob Ross,"Let it go. Okay. All righty, I think were gonna call that picture finished"
Bob Ross,"And, once again, we want to thank you very much for watching us"
Bob Ross,"And from all of us here at WMVT, happy painting. Thank you very much. guitar music"
Bob Ross,"- Hello, glad to see you again"
Bob Ross,"Today I thought wed do an almighty winter picture and I want to put a great of emphasis on the sky and how we make big bellowy, fluffy clouds that just roll and lay up in the sky here"
Bob Ross,"So Ive covered the canvas with magic white and Im gonna start with sort of a grey color here made by mixing a little Prussian blue, a little brown and a little white and were just gonna start gently working this and let it go"
Bob Ross,"There we go, we just sort of work it around and around here. This is a winter sky"
Bob Ross,"Bad weathers coming in. Okay, here we go. Now we just sorta bring all this together"
Bob Ross,But we want this swirling turning action here. And then very lightly back in here. Okay
Bob Ross,Now well take our fan brush with a little bit of white and well put just a touch of permanent red with it here
Bob Ross,"Okay, a little bit of magic white"
Bob Ross,"Now were gonna start way back in the back, the cloud farthest away first"
Bob Ross,And well start working this. There we go
Bob Ross,light piano music And you keep this brush moving all the time
Bob Ross,Just let it dance and play and have fun up through there. Very gently well blend that
Bob Ross,"Okay, now were ready to start working it"
Bob Ross,"Always doing the thing, its farthest away first and working forward. There"
Bob Ross,"Then well hypnotize a little bit, very gently, we dont want to destroy what weve worked so hard to put in here, we just wanna blend it together"
Bob Ross,There
Bob Ross,"Today Im using two fan brushes, one so I can work with the darks and the other one with the lights"
Bob Ross,Well throw some ol grey clouds in here that are sneaking around and having fun too. There he comes
Bob Ross,And maybe theres an old grey one just sorta laying out here like this
Bob Ross,And well work this one just a little touch. And well go back into another little white cloud here
Bob Ross,"And by the time Ive got down this low Im getting away from the pink that I had, I just want the pink in the top to give indication that sunlights playing through there"
Bob Ross,Then all these beautiful clouds just happen right up here in the sky
Bob Ross,Clouds used to be something that drove me crazy when I was a traditional painter
Bob Ross,"Youd work for days and days to make big, fluffy clouds"
Bob Ross,"And here you just sorta let it happen, dont worry about it. Dont try to plan em"
Bob Ross,"Ah, theres another nice one. Cause clouds are free. They have no boundaries"
Bob Ross,"They come and go as they please. Okay, lets see"
Bob Ross,"Really pushing that paint into the canvas, you wanna grind the value right into the materials"
Bob Ross,"While were talking about canvas, one of the things to look for when youre buying a canvas to paint this technique is look for a canvas thats acrylic primed"
Bob Ross,Thatll hold the magic white on there longer. Keep it wet longer
Bob Ross,And we depend on this being wet throughout the painting
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe theres another little fluffy right in here. Just wherever"
Bob Ross,"Just let it happen, dont worry about it. There we go"
Bob Ross,And here were just putting some brush strokes in. Indicate light coming through there
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe laying up here in the clouds we have some little mountains that are just laying in here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, we want these to blend right into nothing. Were gonna lay these right in the clouds"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well have a little light playing down through here. Just bouncing around, having fun. There"
Bob Ross,"Right up to this peak. Want these to be far, far away just about disappearing right into the sky"
Bob Ross,"Then were gonna diffuse them by just tap, tap, tapping right along, always following the angles here"
Bob Ross,Just tapping
Bob Ross,And then well gently hypnotize them so they just disappear right on back into the picture. Okay
Bob Ross,Now we can just lay clouds all around em. Just set em down in there. Well work those a little bit
Bob Ross,Maybe a little touch of grey in here. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now when youre at home doing this and have unlimited time, you can put a great deal more detail in here"
Bob Ross,This is just to give you an idea of how its done. Okay. Lets have an almighty mountain
Bob Ross,"Lets come all the way down, what the heck. He just comes right up through here. Very little paint"
Bob Ross,"Were really pushing this paint into the canvas. Okay, then well take, pull that down"
Bob Ross,Just makes the next layer of paint stick better
Bob Ross,Im gonna add just a little touch of Prussian blue here. Just so we have some shadows under the snow
Bob Ross,Okay. Now we can put some almighty snow coming all the way down through this mountain here
Bob Ross,And were just gonna let it run and play. Just let it go. There. See how easy that is
Bob Ross,Just let it flow in there. And well run some right along this mountain peak
Bob Ross,"And maybe here since our lights coming from here, this ones gonna be highlighted from the other side"
Bob Ross,Well create a little valley maybe right down through there
Bob Ross,We can lay in some shadows here using just some Prussian blue and white. There we go
Bob Ross,"Any place you want a ridge to stand up, all you have to do is lay a shadow underneath it and automatically its right there"
Bob Ross,Some shadows running down behind this one. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now, with a clean dry brush Im gonna diffuse this, lay it in this mist, I want this to be misty in the back"
Bob Ross,"Like its very, very, very cold"
Bob Ross,"Where I live, in Fairbanks, its not unusual for it to get 60 or 70 degrees below zero"
Bob Ross,"And its always very, very misty. We have ice fog that forms and lays in between the trees"
Bob Ross,Its cold but its beautiful. Mmkay
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take here, a little bit of the grey color and Im gonna lighten it up just a little bit with a little titanium white"
Bob Ross,"There, nice color"
Bob Ross,Load this brush full of paint and well put a little tree way back in the distance here
Bob Ross,And I thought today wed make these little trees with the fan brush
Bob Ross,"We can make them with a fan brush, one inch brush, two and a half inch brush"
Bob Ross,Today I thought wed do it with this. And you want these to be very quiet. Very subdued
Bob Ross,"To give the illusion of distance. Okay, maybe theres another one right there"
Bob Ross,And we can start laying in a little bit of snow up here
Bob Ross,And see how that color comes through and we use that to make the shadow effect. Mmkay
Bob Ross,"And as I say, I want to lay this in mist so Im just gonna gently tap this"
Bob Ross,I want it to be far away and misty
Bob Ross,"Now well come forward just a little bit, drop in some more little trees here. There we go"
Bob Ross,Just go and forth with your fan brush and youre sorta bending these bristles downward
Bob Ross,And however many trees you want. This is your world so you can put as many trees in it as you want
Bob Ross,"But you notice, these trees are a little darker than the first ones we put in. Mmkay"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets mist these up just a little bit. All Im doing is just tapping"
Bob Ross,Then Ill lift it a little
Bob Ross,And maybe we got a few little bushes growing right around here that just covered with snow. Okay
Bob Ross,"So, well put some magic white and some titanium white, mix em together"
Bob Ross,Thin paint will stick to a thick paint
Bob Ross,"Then well just put these little sparklers here, just little snow covered bushes. There we go"
Bob Ross,And well put a few little sticks in here
Bob Ross,"Mmkay, lets move over to this side and see what we can put in here"
Bob Ross,"Trees are closer to you, theyre gonna be getting a little bigger. There"
Bob Ross,"And you need to, when youre making these evergreen trees here, you need to leave spots open in between the limbs"
Bob Ross,Birds have got to have a place to sit and winds gotta get through. Dont kill all those
Bob Ross,Get away from the little Christmas tree things we used to make when we were kids in school
Bob Ross,"Trees dont grow even, they dont grow straight"
Bob Ross,"However makes them happy according to the weather, the conditions, the amount of heat or cold"
Bob Ross,All these things effect the way a tree looks. Okay. Maybe we want one right in the front
Bob Ross,I just made this a little darker so he stands out. A little baby tree right there
Bob Ross,"See, because hes a little darker now he shows otherwise he wouldnt show"
Bob Ross,Hed just lay in there and be quiet and youd never know he was there. Now we know hes there
Bob Ross,Gonna tap this just gently. Okay. And lets have this come down like this
Bob Ross,Well just make another little thing coming right down through here. Change the angle. Mmkay
Bob Ross,Pull that right through
Bob Ross,"This is a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat here in a second, its about to freeze me to death"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And as you can see, where the paint breaks, shadows automatically happen in the snow"
Bob Ross,Its very rare that snow is pure white
Bob Ross,You always have the shadows and you have some dirt that shows through and all those little things
Bob Ross,"Okay, well have some of those nice little snow covered bushes on this side too"
Bob Ross,"Dont want this side to get jealous. Okay, a little magic white, a little plain white. There we go"
Bob Ross,Nice little snow covered bushes
Bob Ross,"Maybe, if we had such a beautiful scene, maybe wed need a little cabin about here"
Bob Ross,We have to have a little hunters cabin or something right out through here
Bob Ross,So first Ill take and scrape off the basic shape
Bob Ross,"This gets rid of all this loose paint, the thinner paint so well have something to work on here"
Bob Ross,And well take that off
Bob Ross,"Its also a very good way to lay in your cabin, to work on a perspective and lay it out exactly the way you want it"
Bob Ross,And just a general shape. The big thing is to get the loose paint off
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well take a little Van Dyke brown and well back this back eave back here"
Bob Ross,"Just like so, nice and dark. There we go. Then well lay a roof on here. There"
Bob Ross,Just a little bitty cabin out here in the woods. Little snow on the other side
Bob Ross,Maybe the snows pretty thick so well lay it on there nice and thick so it looks strong
Bob Ross,"Then well put the front on. Mmkay. Son of a gun, there he comes"
Bob Ross,"Mmkay, lets make this an old cabin. So well just make it weather beaten, old boards"
Bob Ross,Lay some shadows on top of that
Bob Ross,"This is Van Dyke brown again, Im just sort of alternating back and forth between brown and white to make it look very, very old"
Bob Ross,"This old hunter he. He went out after moose, it was too big and he ran off with him"
Bob Ross,So the old cabins just standing here abandoned. Better put a door on it though
Bob Ross,Maybe a passing hunter would like to stay here overnight. There we go
Bob Ross,And well make this an old slab cabin. Well just put some boards right in there. Mmkay
Bob Ross,"And you can, if you wanna push this back a little bit, we can put a darker color on here first"
Bob Ross,Well just push this cabin right back into the bushes a little bit and well have some little bushes growing right down like that
Bob Ross,Little big of magic. Okay
Bob Ross,"Maybe when this old fella lived here, maybe he had a little fence that ran back"
Bob Ross,He mightve had an animal or two he kept in here so lets just put a little fence
Bob Ross,And this little fence is running over the hill. Well just let it go right on back over the hill
Bob Ross,Just see the top of that one. And a little bit of highlight
Bob Ross,Then a little bit of snow on top of the posts. There we go
Bob Ross,"Okay, then we can run some wire right down this and let it disappear right over the hill. Like so"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe a couple little bushes out here in the front. And I think we need some icicles"
Bob Ross,So well use just straight magic white and well pull down some little icicles here
Bob Ross,"Using the liner brush, this is a number two script liner. Whew, its getting colder already. Mmkay"
Bob Ross,Lets move out the snow a little. And lets put a few more little sticks here and there. Mmkay
Bob Ross,"This is truly an almighty mountain. There we go, few little sticks here and there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe here and there are little indications. Mmkay. Just here and there, we dont wanna overdo"
Bob Ross,"We want this to look very soft, very misty, far, far away. Mmkay. Take a little thin oil here"
Bob Ross,And well just sign this happy little picture
Bob Ross,And I hope in the last 30 minutes we have shown you something that you can do very quickly
Bob Ross,"A way to make some almighty clouds, almighty mountains"
Bob Ross,"Some fantastic things using very, very limited pallet"
Bob Ross,"Weve used mostly blue, brown and white in this picture almost nothing else at all"
Bob Ross,But its a very effective picture and it has a tremendous sky. You can work on this sky
Bob Ross,"Once again, you have unlimited time at home"
Bob Ross,You can take this sky to points that are almost unbelievable
Bob Ross,"You can work it, you can alternate between darks and lights in the sky"
Bob Ross,"You can make skies that almost look like religious skies, that things are gonna come through"
Bob Ross,"Practice it, work with it, dont give up on it"
Bob Ross,All you need is a dream in here that you wanna put on there
Bob Ross,"And we thank you very, very much for being with us today"
Bob Ross,"Once again, if you have questions, if you have comments, feel free to drop us a line"
Bob Ross,"Well be glad to answer any question that we can. From all of us here, happy painting"
Bob Ross,"Thank you very, very much for watching. relaxing guitar music"
Bob Ross,"- Well welcome back, glad to see you again today"
Bob Ross,I thought today wed do something a little different and Ive taken the liberty of going ahead and covering the canvas with a complete layer of Sap Green
Bob Ross,And to that Im gonna add a little Prussian Blue right on the bottom here
Bob Ross,And we just start at the bottom and work up so that it gets lighter and lighter as we go up
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"I thought today wed make a happy little stream, its just sort of running through the woods here"
Bob Ross,"There. Okay, we just work this blue back and forth so it graduates in value as it goes up"
Bob Ross,"gentle music Okay. Now, lets take, lets use this brush"
Bob Ross,Well take a little bit of Cadmium Yellow and lets make a light source in here
Bob Ross,And well just do this by making little X patterns. There we go
Bob Ross,Just work it around and round and round so it gets it darker and darker as it goes out from the center
Bob Ross,Maybe a touch more. Always starting in the light area and working outward. There we go
Bob Ross,"Just back and forth, little Xs. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now well take the big brush, and very gently well hypnotize this. There. Just let it blend outward"
Bob Ross,"So that we sort of have a light source, thats all were looking for here"
Bob Ross,"Now still using the big brush, well go right back into the Sap Green"
Bob Ross,"And well do some basic tree shapes here. We push the paint into the canvas, just really push it"
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"And you need an almighty easel when youre doing this because youre really, really pressing the paint into the canvas"
Bob Ross,"gentle music Okay. Maybe well have another big tree right in here. Okay, there it is"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that fantastic, that you can just push a tree right out of your brush like that"
Bob Ross,"Well have another tree here. No use stopping, were having so much fun here with these trees. Okay"
Bob Ross,And already we have a basic shape to work with
Bob Ross,"We really dont plan these paintings, we let them happen, we just sort of decide where we want basic shapes and work from there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets take the almighty knife, a little Van Dyke Brown and white mixed together"
Bob Ross,And well put some trunks on these almighty trees
Bob Ross,And all were gonna do is touch and sort of pull a little bit. Itll get wider as you go down
Bob Ross,There we are. upbeat guitar music And maybe well have another trunk hiding back in here somewhere
Bob Ross,Just make all kind of little tree things happen here
Bob Ross,"This is sort of different than the paintings weve done previously, because this painting has no Magic White on it"
Bob Ross,"All we do is start with the Sap Green, completely cover the canvas, work the Prussian blue from the bottom upward to make it darker in the foreground"
Bob Ross,"These are the kind of things that we continually look for, new ideas, new ways of using this fantastic technique"
Bob Ross,"And these ideas we put out continually to all the people that enjoy this type of painting, we have a little quarterly newsletter that we use to put these ideas out to people so they are current in whats happening"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets just have another almighty trunk right down through here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well highlight these just a little bit, with a little plain white"
Bob Ross,Just think where the light would strike and run through here and have fun
Bob Ross,jazzy guitar music There we go
Bob Ross,"And over on this side now, the lights gonna come from the opposing direction, the opposite direction"
Bob Ross,Just a little here and there. Okay. Now well take a one inch brush and a little bit of Magic White
Bob Ross,And well start with some yellow and a touch of Phthalo Green
Bob Ross,"Remember that a thin paint will stick to a thick paint so we thinned it just a little bit with a little Magic White, and then we just push out all these thousands of little leaves"
Bob Ross,There they come. There they are. Isnt that fantastic
Bob Ross,"If youre painting along with us, by now you should begin to have little leaves all over these trees, just beautiful little leaves"
Bob Ross,"Leave a lot of the dark areas in here, we dont want to kill all the dark areas"
Bob Ross,We need the dark in order to show the light. There
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe well come right down here and drop in another happy little bush. There they come"
Bob Ross,And over in here
Bob Ross,"You want this to be the brightest area in the painting, back here where the light source is"
Bob Ross,"As we work forward, were gonna get darker and darker and darker. Mmm-kay"
Bob Ross,Maybe a little light coming through right in here
Bob Ross,"Now put your trunk in before you put the leaves though, so you have leaves in front of the trunk, you dont want the trunk sitting on the outside of the tree"
Bob Ross,"Okay. Theres a nice little bush, there he is. And maybe over here, just happy little thing growing"
Bob Ross,"Natures so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it, let it make you happy. Okay, theres another one"
Bob Ross,"Now Im gonna go into a little Sap Green, begin using a little Sap Green with this yellow so it begins to get a little darker as we work back here"
Bob Ross,And well put some highlights on this little tree. gentle guitar music There we go
Bob Ross,"By now you should begin having the feeling that youre walking through the deep woods of all the beautiful tree shapes are there, the little squirrels are hiding in the trees, the bunny rabbits are behind"
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"Once again, dont kill all this dark area, you need it to produce distance in the painting. Okay"
Bob Ross,That should give us enough to get started with
Bob Ross,"Now well take the almighty fan brush and well take a little bit of Magic White, and a little bit of Firm White"
Bob Ross,"And well make a, lets have a little waterfall thats happening back here, and maybe a bubbling little stream is just working its way through"
Bob Ross,"So often we avoid running water, running water is a lot of fun, so here we go"
Bob Ross,"Pull it over, and let it drop, if youre making a little waterfall"
Bob Ross,"Then we take the fan brush and push, makes the little foamy things happen"
Bob Ross,"Then we begin building our running water, and were pushing the fan brush so that it bends upward and the foams on the top instead of on the bottom"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Let all these little things just happen. Mmm, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Maybe under the water here, theres a little stones, causing the water to sort of just bubble over"
Bob Ross,"You might not see this stone, but its under there"
Bob Ross,"As it comes towards you, let it get wider, bigger, stronger"
Bob Ross,"More of these little things, little actions that are happening here"
Bob Ross,gentle guitar music All kinds of little churning motions
Bob Ross,"And avoid having your waterfall here and stream coming straight through your painting, let it sort of wander around"
Bob Ross,All these little water actions
Bob Ross,"And they all hide here in your fan brush, all you have to do is sort of push them out. Okay, good"
Bob Ross,"Alrighty, maybe maybe back here in the distance theres, we have a little stone back here"
Bob Ross,We just use some Van Dyke brown and well build us a little stone
Bob Ross,And maybe theres a little stone out here too
Bob Ross,"This is your world, so you put stones wherever you want"
Bob Ross,"This painting comes right of your heart, so just let it sort of flow. Let it happen"
Bob Ross,Maybe well take a little bit of brown and white and the least little touch of blue
Bob Ross,"Just to make sort of a grey color here. And we can highlight these little stones, just like that"
Bob Ross,Maybe theres a little ridge coming down through here. Little sunlight playing across the stones
Bob Ross,"A little dark edge underneath here, so that it has some distance between the water and the stone"
Bob Ross,"And we take the little fan brush, and splash some water up on the stones there, there. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe well let this just drift right on down through here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right along here, theres another happy little waterfall thats happening right here"
Bob Ross,"So you take your fan brush, and go straight, and let it just fall over. Just like so"
Bob Ross,Isnt that something. You can make a waterfall that quick
Bob Ross,"Just a small one, you dont want to have a violent waterfall here, just a little bitty waterfall"
Bob Ross,And then we push to make our little foamy areas where the waterfalls gonna hit and crash
Bob Ross,"There we go. Okay, now lets take the big brush again and use some Sap Green and Prussian Blue"
Bob Ross,Its getting darker as it comes down. And well throw in some more happy little bushes back here
Bob Ross,You need the dark in order to show the light
Bob Ross,"gentle guitar music Okay, maybe over here theres a nice bush too"
Bob Ross,Let some of these bushes protrude out over the water. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now we can take a little more of the highlight color, some Cad Yellow with a little bit of Phthalo and Sap Green mixed together"
Bob Ross,Im gonna start back here and push this rock back into the painting
Bob Ross,We just put a little bush in front of it. There we go
Bob Ross,And maybe right here theres some nice little things that just sort of hang over the water
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets do this nice one right here. There we go, there we go. You can do it, you can do it"
Bob Ross,Just push that waterfall right back into the painting
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets lets take a little more brown here and just put a little stone, a little gravel out here for all these nice bushes and stuff to sit on"
Bob Ross,There we go. Little highlight on the stones
Bob Ross,gentle guitar music And a few little grassy things that grow right on down the bank here
Bob Ross,Maybe well even get daring and put a little stone out here in the water. There
Bob Ross,"Just lay it in with Van Dyke Brown, then we highlight it with sort of the grey color"
Bob Ross,"There, just let this bright play just run across this little stone. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Little more of the Magic White, a little Firm White"
Bob Ross,Now were gonna start playing the water around this stone
Bob Ross,"Maybe it just comes around like so, sort of falls over, splashes a little here, around the side, down"
Bob Ross,All kinds of little actions happening in this
Bob Ross,"Okay, a little bit of water splashing up against the rocks here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now were getting a nice little stream here"
Bob Ross,"You can see how its beginning to pick up the blue thats underneath here, and make this water darker as it comes closer to you"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Okay, lets go back to good old big brush here. Little more blue and Sap Green"
Bob Ross,And well project some bushes right up through here now
Bob Ross,"Need a lot of paint in the brush, more green than blue"
Bob Ross,And we just let these run right on down like so
Bob Ross,"jazzy guitar music And we can highlight these with a little yellow, Sap Green"
Bob Ross,Were getting much darker in color now. There
Bob Ross,Just sort of vary your color tones back and forth a little so they stand out
Bob Ross,"Leave the dark areas, thats the only thing you have to separate all these beautiful bushes"
Bob Ross,"Mm, theres a nice one. Okay. Add a little bush right in here"
Bob Ross,Looks like some of the beautiful streams that we have in Alaska
Bob Ross,"Walk through the woods, and you listen to, and you look at. And they make you happy"
Bob Ross,They have a beautiful sound to them
Bob Ross,You can almost hear the bubbling and carrying on as it travels down the creek bed here
Bob Ross,"Just with the Van Dyke Brown here, were just adding a few little sticks here and there, you always have in the woods"
Bob Ross,Okay
Bob Ross,Now we can take a clean knife and just scrape through the dark areas and let the canvas show through to give the indication of all kind of little sticks and twigs that are going through here
Bob Ross,There they are. Just using the point of the knife here
Bob Ross,And these little sticks create tremendous distance in the painting
Bob Ross,"So many of the fast painting techniques that I have seen around the country as I teach this almighty method, are very flat, have very little depth to them"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe now, we might as well have some fun here"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some Van Dyke Brown, and lets put an almighty dead tree right up through here"
Bob Ross,You always have dead trees in the woods when youre walking around. There
Bob Ross,"Be brave, go right across the waterfall here. And well just lay this in with a knife"
Bob Ross,Were using very thick paint here. Right across the top
Bob Ross,And well just give him a little friend right beside him here
Bob Ross,"This whole trees just about, just about had it"
Bob Ross,Hes gonna sort of fall over in the stream and be washed away here pretty soon
Bob Ross,"But until them, hes still part of the beauty thats ever-evident in nature"
Bob Ross,"Well just make him a little taller, that way hell make a bigger splash when he hits the water"
Bob Ross,Okay
Bob Ross,"Now Im gonna use the liner brush with a little bit of thin oil on it, a little yellow and a little Permanent Red mixed together, well brighten this one up a little touch"
Bob Ross,"And Im gonna just go down the side of it here, just highlighting a little"
Bob Ross,"We need something bright here, so Im gonna just use this tree. There"
Bob Ross,"And let this sort of streak so it looks like bark. Okay, well wash him off"
Bob Ross,"And well use some more of the thin oil and a little Van Dyke Brown, and well put a few old branches that are hanging on this tree"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and with the thin oil, it makes the paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"So once again, youre working with thin and thick paints, the thin paint will stick to the thicker paint"
Bob Ross,"And I recommend you use an oil, if you use paint thinner it has a tendency to bleed if youre not very careful"
Bob Ross,"And the oil makes it much slicker. There we go. Mm, there we are"
Bob Ross,"Just a few old limbs here and there, lets get a little more oil here"
Bob Ross,"And when youre working this paint in the oil, turn your brush, that brings it to a nice point"
Bob Ross,And you can make all these delicate little limbs and stuff. So put some over here on this one
Bob Ross,"At home you have unlimited time, here were limited by our time factor, but you can put tremendous detail in these paintings"
Bob Ross,"So were just trying to give you an idea here, were just trying to give you a guide to follow, to teach you how to use this fantastic technique"
Bob Ross,"And at home, let your imagination be your guide, let your heart take you wherever you want to be"
Bob Ross,"gentle guitar music There, look at all those little limbs. And just in a matter of minutes"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe well have one come in right through here. There we go"
Bob Ross,Just let them flow off your brush
Bob Ross,"And this tree tends to push everything back in the painting, give it more distance"
Bob Ross,And maybe theres just an old hanging sort of here and there. There we go
Bob Ross,"Okay, well take a little touch more of the highlight color, thats yellow with a touch of Permanent Red"
Bob Ross,And a little oil in it. And well just highlight some of these major limbs here
Bob Ross,Just let the brush flow right down the limb
Bob Ross,"If you have a problem, maybe your hands not steady enough to do this, use your palette or something to sort of balance your hand"
Bob Ross,"I was very fortunate, I was blessed with a very steady hand"
Bob Ross,And it comes in very handy when youre doing these little delicate things
Bob Ross,"gentle music Okay, your little highlights over here. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of work all this together. Little bit right up here. Okay, well clean out the brush here"
Bob Ross,And lets see. What do we need here
Bob Ross,"Im gonna pull this down just a little bit, to make it look a little, there we go"
Bob Ross,"A little more of a cliff right here. Stone, very dark"
Bob Ross,Maybe right over here well build a nice little stone right here too
Bob Ross,"We have one in the water, maybe we need one over here. This is straight Van Dyke Brown again"
Bob Ross,And well take a little touch of the blue and the brown and white. Okay
Bob Ross,"Just lay this on very gently, just let the paint break. Its a very, very gentle touch"
Bob Ross,Super gentle touch. You almost let the knife touch
Bob Ross,"Now well take a little more of the Magic White, a little green and yellow and mix it together, well make some little bushes here to come up and protrude over the stone"
Bob Ross,You need a thin paint to go over the top of this very thick paint that youve put on. So there we go
Bob Ross,And we put some little grassy areas around the trees foots. Okay. Alrighty
Bob Ross,gentle guitar music And we wanna splash that back up on the stone here. Like so. Okay
Bob Ross,"Good, I think we just about have our little stream finished today"
Bob Ross,"And if youre painting along with us, you should have just about completed this painting"
Bob Ross,I might put a few little touches here and there
Bob Ross,"As I say, at home you have time to put in tremendous detail, you can work and carry on and build all kind of happy little things in here"
Bob Ross,"Here, were limited by the amount of time we have so were just trying to show you the basic technique, the basic idea"
Bob Ross,Need a little highlight on this little dead one thats laying right out through here. Okay
Bob Ross,Just a little sticks here and there. Little brighter color so they show up
Bob Ross,Theres one right in front of the stone
Bob Ross,"Okay, I think well just take a little thin oil, Permanent Red here, and well sign this painting"
Bob Ross,Little more oil. upbeat guitar music And I hope youve enjoyed this. This is sort of a new idea
Bob Ross,"As I say, weve used no Magic White on this canvas, just pure Sap Green"
Bob Ross,"This will work in a multitude of colors, you can paint the canvas with blue, with combinations of colors, and make some of the most fantastic little paintings youve ever seen"
Bob Ross,"One of the prettiest ones is to paint it with Van Dyke Brown, and make beautiful autumn scenes out of it"
Bob Ross,"And the brown is picked up by the yellows and oranges and reds and just, it just stands out"
Bob Ross,Fantastic painting. Okay. Well just sign this one. There we go. upbeat guitar music Yeah
Bob Ross,And well call that painting finished
Bob Ross,"Once again, I hope youve painted along with us, and youve enjoyed this picture. It is a lot of fun"
Bob Ross,"And we hope to see you again next time, and well do another happy little painting"
Bob Ross,"Until then, from all of us here, happy painting. upbeat guitar music"
Bob Ross,- Welcome back. Today I thought wed do a painting thats right out of the heart of Alaska
Bob Ross,"Were gonna start with a black canvas, which Ive already covered with a coat of Van Dyke brown and Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,"And these colors are transparent, so itll still look black"
Bob Ross,"In this painting we want to show the Moon in the sky with some happy little clouds floating around, put some almighty mountains, some beautiful, frost-colored bushes, and well see what happens from there"
Bob Ross,- Im gonna start with a little titanium white
Bob Ross,And well start right up here where we want the Moon to be. And just make little x-es
Bob Ross,And just start working around
Bob Ross,You want to start in the center and work outwards so that the light gets progressively darker as it moves away from the Moon
Bob Ross,And well go out in this direction so that it hits the curvature of the Earth and bounces back up
Bob Ross,"Okay, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Already, you should be able to see how the white paint is beginning to pick up the color underneath"
Bob Ross,And well just blend this together. There we go
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we dont want to let this get too bright we still want it to look like night when were finished, so just work it round and around and all the way out to the edges"
Bob Ross,And well do a little over in here
Bob Ross,"Now then, well take the large brush, and very gently, well bring this together, just by making little x patterns"
Bob Ross,There we go. Makes all the little actions in the sky. And well come across
Bob Ross,"Now, lets put the Moon in"
Bob Ross,"And well do that by taking a clean brush, and well load it full of white paint, and we go right straight into the canvas where we want the Moon to be, and we push quite hard"
Bob Ross,"And push the paint right into the canvas, and just turn it. There"
Bob Ross,"Get it in with the knife, very carefully, well take off just the excess paint"
Bob Ross,"Let me clean this ol big brush out here. There we go. Now very gently, well bring this together"
Bob Ross,"Just work it back and forth, and create the illusion of a moon setting up here in the sky. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets put some happy little clouds up here"
Bob Ross,"And well use the almighty fan brush, and well just use this blue and brown color. And"
Bob Ross,"Load it full of paint, and well take, just using the corner, and well put in some happy little clouds, just let one float right across the Moon, here"
Bob Ross,Lot of paint on the brush. Okay. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now, maybe, maybe, maybe, you can see right up here, well put another happy little cloud"
Bob Ross,Little sneaky cloud running around here at night. There we go
Bob Ross,"And youre pushing this paint into the canvas really, really work it into the canvas"
Bob Ross,"And maybe down here weve got some little delicate clouds that are just floating around, really small, little clouds"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Just lay em in. Mmmkay. Now, let us clean the fan brush. And wiping dry"
Bob Ross,"And well take a little bit of titanium white, mixed with just a little bit of the same color"
Bob Ross,And well push some highlights in here. Just take the fan brush and just work the corners
Bob Ross,Just the corner of the brush. Just push the paint right in here. There
Bob Ross,A little light playing across the top of this cloud. Maybe right along here
Bob Ross,"This is your world, so wherever you want light to strike this cloud, let it happen"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and lets put some highlights right along these little clouds right here"
Bob Ross,And were pushing quite hard with this
Bob Ross,"Once again, we want to push the color right into the material if possible. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now, in this cloud up here, since its above the Moon, the lights gonna strike the bottom of it"
Bob Ross,So we put the highlights on the bottom rather than on the top. There
Bob Ross,Give me a nice little thing right out through here like that
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little light striking around up in here, just a little something playing"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now, well take the big brush. Make sure its dry and clean"
Bob Ross,And were just gonna gently hypnotize this. Just to bring it together. Isnt that fantastic
Bob Ross,Look at that. Look at all the little things that happen in this cloud. This is unplanned
Bob Ross,It really just happens. You really cant control whats gonna happen here
Bob Ross,"Dont try to, dont fight it. Use what happens. Okay. Lets make a happy little mountain now"
Bob Ross,"Well take some blue and some brown, still using the same color"
Bob Ross,"And well draw in our basic mountain shape, here. Here we go. Really push"
Bob Ross,Really forcing that paint into the material
Bob Ross,Maybe well make this one come up a little higher so we can see clouds behind it
Bob Ross,"We use a large brush to pull that paint down, this removes any excess that we have left on the canvas"
Bob Ross,Cause were trying to get all the paint off the canvas that we possibly can. Okay
Bob Ross,"Lets just clean the brush. Once again, we clean the brush with odorless paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets put some snow on the mountain"
Bob Ross,Well take some titanium white and just a little touch of blue. Just a little blue. Okay
Bob Ross,And lets let some snow just run right down this mountain. Just let it break and play
Bob Ross,This has a very delicate touch. Very light touch. Youre almost touching the canvas with the knife
Bob Ross,"Oh, heres a nice little ridge, just let this little ridge just play around like that"
Bob Ross,And there we go. And well put a little bit of light right on this little peak
Bob Ross,Let it just break and play
Bob Ross,Now were gonna use blue and white next to a darker value for the shadow and well start right here and let this just follow right along
Bob Ross,Let it go. Okay. And well put a little shadow behind this one. There we go
Bob Ross,Maybe all the way over here a little shadow. Each highlight needs its own private shadow
Bob Ross,And we can bring this down a little further
Bob Ross,"As you work on these mountains, you begin seeing all kinds of little things happening"
Bob Ross,Use what you see. Dont plan it. And maybe well put a little ridge right here
Bob Ross,"Ah, theres another one, I see him right there. There he is"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets lay the bottom of these mountains into a little mist"
Bob Ross,"Clean, dry brush, and all were gonna do is tap"
Bob Ross,"Always following the angles weve created in the mountain, down like so. Just tap"
Bob Ross,"Mmmkay, over here, well follow these angles, and tap from this direction. Okay, a little bit here"
Bob Ross,Then were gonna lift upward just enough to take out the little tap marks. There we go
Bob Ross,"Mmmkay, now were getting a nice little misty effect over here"
Bob Ross,"And we just work that right out, and were ready to come forward"
Bob Ross,Weve created small mighty mountains in just a few minutes here. Mmmkay
Bob Ross,"Now, well take a little more of the blue and brown, and back to one of our golden rules, you need dark in order to show light, so were gonna start by putting some dark on here"
Bob Ross,"Load a lot of paint into the brush, and we just push in little bushes right out of the"
Bob Ross,Right out of the brush. Here he comes. There he is
Bob Ross,Just put in some dark on him so well have some light showing. Alright
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we can take a brush. We use a little bit of magic white and a little bit of plain white"
Bob Ross,Thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So were thinning the paint just a little bit
Bob Ross,"And were gonna push in beautiful little snow-covered trees, way back in the distance on here. There"
Bob Ross,Look at those son of a guns. There they are
Bob Ross,"Just hundreds of little trees, little bushes, all these things happening way back there. Okay"
Bob Ross,Now well take the big brush and clean it up a little bit
Bob Ross,"And we have all these nice bushes here, they need some reflections"
Bob Ross,"So well take a clean brush and just a little bit of white paint on it, and well pull that down"
Bob Ross,Just grab ahold and pull. Make these nice streaks
Bob Ross,"This is mixing with the color that we have underneath, the blue and the brown"
Bob Ross,These lines need to be straight down reflections. What a fantastic way to make reflections. There
Bob Ross,"Now, well go across just enough to give it a watery effect we dont want to destroy all those lines"
Bob Ross,We just want to make it look like its in the water. Mmmkay. Lets take
Bob Ross,Lay a little touch of snow along there. Well just take the knife with a little paint
Bob Ross,Just put some little snow right along there
Bob Ross,"Ooh, better get your coat out, this is gonna be a cold painting"
Bob Ross,I may have to go find my old mukluks and put em on
Bob Ross,"In Alaska, we have a word for people who have came to the great country and only been there a short period of time it is called cheechako"
Bob Ross,"And if youve been in Alaska less than a year, youre a cheechako"
Bob Ross,So maybe youve learned a new word today
Bob Ross,"And where I live its not unusual for it to get 60, 70 degrees below zero"
Bob Ross,"And we have a thing in nature that happens, its called ice fog"
Bob Ross,"Normally, it has to be about 30 below or colder"
Bob Ross,"And this ice fog coats everything, every little branch, with little crystals of ice that weigh almost nothing"
Bob Ross,But they create unbelievable beauty
Bob Ross,Light plays though these little crystals and acts as little prisms and breaks up the light
Bob Ross,You see all the fantastic colors shining and shimmering and it is really something
Bob Ross,"Okay, here Im just scratching right through the paint. Make it look like little trunks"
Bob Ross,"Alrighty, lets take the almighty fan brush"
Bob Ross,"During this series we have made trees with a two and a half inch brush, with a one inch brush, and a fan brush"
Bob Ross,"So, all of these brushes you can use to create almighty trees. Today were gonna try the fan brush"
Bob Ross,Load a lot of paint into the brush. Figure out where youd like to have a beautiful little tree
Bob Ross,"Just touch, and then just using the corner of the brush, just begin building some little limbs on here"
Bob Ross,There we go. And were still using the blue and the brown. Come right down there
Bob Ross,That looks like a good place for a tree. Gonna push the paint right into the canvas
Bob Ross,"Okay, and maybe we need one over here thats sort of tired, sort of leaning over a little bit"
Bob Ross,"In nature, trees grow in every direction. Maybe well put another one right here"
Bob Ross,"These trees are so much fun to get started on, I have a hard time stopping"
Bob Ross,And well put another one right there
Bob Ross,"Now, as we work forward, we want these trees to begin getting much larger to show distance in this painting"
Bob Ross,"In so many of the techniques where people paint very rapidly, the paintings are very flat, very overworked, washed-out looking"
Bob Ross,"In this technique, you can create depth that is unbelievable. Distance in paintings"
Bob Ross,"And this is how we do it. We use size, we use color"
Bob Ross,All of these things combine together to create the illusion of distance in a painting. Alrighty
Bob Ross,"Well, lets do some more trees. Well put some on the other side over here"
Bob Ross,Put an almighty tree up here. There he is. Very dark. Mmmkay
Bob Ross,Just let that tree come right out of your fan brush
Bob Ross,"Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. It takes a little practice"
Bob Ross,"The first time, its gonna be a little touchy. Next time, it gets easier"
Bob Ross,"Each time you do it, you learn from it. You progress"
Bob Ross,"Ive painted for 20 years, and Im still learning. Every day I learn"
Bob Ross,Spend time studying nature if you wish to paint nature. You must understand nature
Bob Ross,"Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now, then, lets do an almighty tree, big tree. Well come right over in here. Okay, here he comes"
Bob Ross,Big ol tree. You got your coat out yet. You may need it here any second
Bob Ross,"In the paintings like this, on the black canvas, you can do a multitude of things with this, multitude"
Bob Ross,You can use all different colors
Bob Ross,"All youre looking for is a color thats transparent, so that the black shows through"
Bob Ross,Use this black to your advantage. Well have another tree right there. There we go
Bob Ross,There are a lot of people we have taught to do these black canvas who are absolutely making a living out of it now
Bob Ross,And we have literally taught thousands and thousands of people to be almighty painters
Bob Ross,To create things of beauty they never dreamed possible. And you can do it too. You can do it
Bob Ross,"Just jump right in here and paint along with us, well teach you how to do it well make a happy painter out of you also"
Bob Ross,"Okay, I think thats enough trees for right now"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little bit of white and blue mixed together, looking for a dark blue, here"
Bob Ross,"And lets go right into this area here, and lets put some, lets put some happy little bushes and trees back in here"
Bob Ross,"All this is is the shadow color. We put the shadow in first, and then well highlight it"
Bob Ross,"And, while weve got the shadow here, lets put some right into the water"
Bob Ross,"We can just reflect some of this right in here. Okay, now, lets"
Bob Ross,"Oh, lets have some bushes over in this side also. Just start bringing this painting together"
Bob Ross,Now at home you have unlimited time
Bob Ross,You can sit and come up with all kinds of fantastic things to do in this
Bob Ross,You can put tremendous detail
Bob Ross,"Here we are limited on time, so were trying to give you ideas, were not trying to just give you something to copy, were trying to give you an idea, to teach you a technique, so that you can use this and make unbelievable things"
Bob Ross,Back into the magic white and the titanium white. And well make some happy little bushes here
Bob Ross,Look how that color stands out against the black. There we go
Bob Ross,"And as you work more and more in this, youll know just by pulling the brush through, the correct consistency of the paint, if its too thin, if its too thick"
Bob Ross,Its only a matter of time where you can pull the brush through that paint and almost tell what brand it is
Bob Ross,"Now well just come across, and well turn this into beautiful little reflections"
Bob Ross,"And while weve got the brush loaded here, well just, lets do this one right here. Big tree here"
Bob Ross,There we go. Little more of the magic white
Bob Ross,And well come right down here and put a happy little bush
Bob Ross,"Now, lets reflect these right into the water just let em reflect. Okay. Clean off the brush"
Bob Ross,Thats the most fun of painting is beating your brush
Bob Ross,Its a good way to get rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Look at those reflections
Bob Ross,But its a very gentle touch
Bob Ross,"And now well take a little bit of white paint, just put some snow in here for all these things to sit on"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Okay, a little bit of dark paint well put some trunks in. Some stems. There we are"
Bob Ross,"This sort of gives the tree body, gives it shape. And it also shows distance in a painting"
Bob Ross,"Use these to your advantage. Okay. Take a little magic white, make us a water line under here"
Bob Ross,Just use a thin paint to make your water line. Itll flow off the knife. Alrighty. There we go
Bob Ross,"Nice little water line. Mmmkay, lets put some happy little bushes over here on the other side now"
Bob Ross,"And well start right here. A nice one, there. Leave a lot of these dark areas showing"
Bob Ross,"Be careful that you dont cover em all up. Your painting will get very, very flat"
Bob Ross,Look at all the snow on those. Okay. And work em in layers so you have distance in here
Bob Ross,"Do one bush at a time. Okay, well put a few little sticks in here. Mmmkay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets lay a little snow into this side. Just using straight titanium white"
Bob Ross,"This is very firm. And let it break, so you have shadows showing through"
Bob Ross,"Just like when we do the mountains, let it break. Okay. There we go. And we lay the snow in like so"
Bob Ross,"And maybe, maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and one day he went to check his beaver traps and maybe he fell into the river here and drowned, but his old cabins still here, so lets draw an old cabin in"
Bob Ross,"I suggest you scrape it with a knife first, scrape out the basic shape"
Bob Ross,"It gets rid of the thin, loose paint underneath"
Bob Ross,"Its also a good way to lay out your general shape of your cabin, get your perspective right"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Just very basic shape, thats all were looking for"
Bob Ross,Big thing is to get rid of all that loose paint
Bob Ross,And well take some Van Dyke brown and well do the far eave out here first. There. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now, well take some titanium white, and lets lay some snow on the roof. Over here. There"
Bob Ross,Lets bring this all together. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now, we need to have a little snow on the other side of the roof, so well just take a little white on the knife and lay it in like so"
Bob Ross,"Little more brown, and well begin putting all this together. There we go"
Bob Ross,A fantastic way to make a little cabin. There
Bob Ross,"And if you want to make it look even older, you can take just a little bit of the white paint and let it just sort of bounce along here, very gently"
Bob Ross,"Just let it touch and bounce. Little more dark to create the shadows on top. Ooh, look at that"
Bob Ross,Look how old that wood looks
Bob Ross,Its a super way to make old buildings and stuff if you ever want to try it
Bob Ross,"Okay, I think we need a door in here now"
Bob Ross,"Somebody might need to come along and stay in this old cabin, so hes got to have a way to get in"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And well take in some highlights around the door, just by using the knife"
Bob Ross,"And probably when this old trapper lived here, hes just like all the rest of us, he ran out of room, so he probably built him a little shed out here"
Bob Ross,So well just build us a little shed. Just bring a little snow for the roof first. There we go
Bob Ross,Just like so. Take a little bit of dark paint. A little brown
Bob Ross,"And we need a wall over here, so well just drop it in. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets make this an old slab cabin"
Bob Ross,So well just cut in some slabs here with the point of the knife. There we go
Bob Ross,And we can take a little white and clean this all up
Bob Ross,"Right now, you should begin having a painting thats beginning to take shape, beginning to look well"
Bob Ross,Should be very happy with it
Bob Ross,"And I think weve said it before, but painting should do one thing for you it should create happiness in your heart"
Bob Ross,It should make you happy. Lets take and put a little bush right here
Bob Ross,Just let a few of these run down
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe a little bush right here to sort of push this cabin back into the painting"
Bob Ross,"Right along that cabin. Okay, we need some highlights on this little bush. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and well cut a few little sticks here and there"
Bob Ross,"Were just cutting right through the light paint, letting the dark show through. Alright"
Bob Ross,This paintings beginning to get close to being done
Bob Ross,"Lets take the fan brush here, and normally, I would leave these trees very dark"
Bob Ross,I want to take a little bit of blue and just tap a little so you can see them a little better at home
Bob Ross,Just to give you an idea
Bob Ross,"Normally I leave them very, very dark, so they really give the impression of night time. Like so"
Bob Ross,"Okay, just here and there. Just a few little highlights. There. And just a few over here. Like so"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Alrighty. I think were gonna sign this painting, and call it finished"
Bob Ross,Take a little of the thin oil. And lets sign it right here. I hope youve enjoyed this painting
Bob Ross,It is a great deal of fun. We certainly have enjoyed being with you today
Bob Ross,"And I hope youve painted along with us, and you also have an almighty painting"
Bob Ross,All you need is the dream in your heart and the desire to put it on canvas
Bob Ross,"Until next time, we wish you happy painting. Thank you very much. happy little country music"
Bob Ross,"- Hello, welcome back"
Bob Ross,"I thought today, wed do an almighty picture that had some huge mountains in it and maybe today, well also work a little bit on putting some clouds floating in front of the mountains"
Bob Ross,"This is always something thats very difficult to do, so Ill try to show ya how to do that and I hope you have a canvas set up on your almighty easel and cool drink in hand and lets go here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna start with a little bit of alizarin crimson and a touch of prussian blue and maybe well just make a sky thats sort of a lavender type and sorta taste it, test it"
Bob Ross,There we go. I already have magic white on the canvas
Bob Ross,"So, were just literally mixing paint right here on the canvas"
Bob Ross,calm jazzy music And well just bring this down to about like so. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now, go into just a little prussian blue and well lay this right in like so, there we go. Okay"
Bob Ross,"And while we have the old brush dirty here, Ill take a little phthalo green in prussian blue and well lay in some water here"
Bob Ross,"And already, we have a masterpiece for a museum of modern art somewhere"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well clean the old brush. Be sure its good and dry"
Bob Ross,"Then, this is just a clean, dry brush and were just gonna bring these two colors together here"
Bob Ross,Okay. Just do you have a nice blending
Bob Ross,You dont wanna be able to tell where one stops and the other one starts
Bob Ross,And well hypnotize it and sort of blend it out
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets take the fan brush, a little bit of titanium white mixed with a touch of permanent red just to give it a little pinkish hue"
Bob Ross,We dont wanna set these clouds on fire
Bob Ross,"All we wanna do is give it just a little hue here, just a little pinkish hue and well push us in some nice little clouds here"
Bob Ross,Were pushing very hard just to push the value right into the canvas
Bob Ross,And maybe well put little cloud floating around right here. Okay
Bob Ross,"Well take and gently, gently, gently blend that together. Very light, delicate touch"
Bob Ross,"Dont overwork these clouds. Theyre very, very easy to overwork em. Then well hypnotize em"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets build us an almighty mountain"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit of blue and some brown, touch of alizarin. And a little bit of white"
Bob Ross,There we go. And mix your color marbley. Dont mix it dead. Lets start way up here
Bob Ross,Put us an almighty mountain. Maybe theres a nice little peak over here. Let this drop down
Bob Ross,Were really pushing this paint into the canvas. Maybe well have another little peak over in here
Bob Ross,And well take off all the excess paint
Bob Ross,Then well take the big brush and pull it down just to make sure weve got all the paint off of it that can come off
Bob Ross,"All we wanna leave is the value in the canvas, the color"
Bob Ross,"Now, well start with a little bit of titanium white and Im gonna mix a little bit of brown and blue with it just to gray it down"
Bob Ross,Just a little bit. We can start putting some highlights on this almighty mountain
Bob Ross,Maybe well have a little peak rolling right down through there
Bob Ross,Maybe a little lights hitting right up here
Bob Ross,"And for shadow color, well take a little bit of blue and brown and white mixed with a little darker value"
Bob Ross,And well just lay us some shadows right in here
Bob Ross,And each little highlight needs its own private shadow. Maybe well add another little peak here
Bob Ross,"This is your mountain, so you can add what you want to on it"
Bob Ross,"Now lets diffuse the bottom of it and here, were just gently tapping"
Bob Ross,"Dont wanna destroy, just diffuse. And then well pull just to take out the little tap marks"
Bob Ross,"Now, well lay some clouds on top of the mountain"
Bob Ross,And Ive added a little bit of magic white with my paint just to make it a little bit thinner
Bob Ross,You remember our golden rule here. Thin paintll stick to a thick paint
Bob Ross,"So, maybe well have a little cloud here that just floats right across the mountain. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right up here, theres one too. Seems like I remember one up here"
Bob Ross,"Now, very carefully, well blend this in. Super light touch here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets take and lets work on this peak now"
Bob Ross,Lets let him travel down and just come right down in the foreground here
Bob Ross,Give him a few little shadows so he stands out as an individual
Bob Ross,And maybe a few little shadows in here
Bob Ross,"Okay and once again, well diffuse this just to lay some mist in here"
Bob Ross,"And then, maybe another little layer of clouds and well add a little more magic white to keep the paint thin"
Bob Ross,And maybe this one just drops right out of the sky here. And plays around the bottom. There we go
Bob Ross,"Just nice, soft little clouds. Okay, this is a very, very delicate touch. There"
Bob Ross,And maybe well just take and maybe theres another little stone right in here. Travels around
Bob Ross,Just to show ya how to continually bring things forward here and we need this to be a little darker than the background back here
Bob Ross,And well lay some highlights right on here. Let that paint break
Bob Ross,Let it break so you have all these little holes in it. Let some of the dark show through
Bob Ross,"There we go. And maybe just a few little clouds, little misty areas floating around in here"
Bob Ross,"This creates a tremendous illusion of distance, makes things far, far away"
Bob Ross,"Now, well just hypnotize this a little touch"
Bob Ross,"And its vitally important, when youre doing this at home, that you use a paint thats very, very firm"
Bob Ross,"Otherwise, you have nothing thats thinner to go over the top of it, so be sure to use a very firm paint"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets mix us up a little color. Well add a little sap green, little more blue in here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe just a touch more alizarin. There we go, nice color"
Bob Ross,"And dont mix it dead, remember not to mix it dead"
Bob Ross,And well take this old big brush and lets put us some little foothills right in here
Bob Ross,"Dont let the size of this big brush scare you away. Use it, it does fantastic things"
Bob Ross,"Now Im gonna give it just a little upward sweep to make it look like little trees way, way back in the distance"
Bob Ross,There we go. Then well tap a little bit here just to lay some mist in between these
Bob Ross,"Well have two of em, I think"
Bob Ross,Now well add a little more of the brown and a little more of the blue just to darken it up a little bit here
Bob Ross,All the same colors
Bob Ross,"Blue, brown, a little alizarin, sap, just to make it a little bit darker so itll look like its in front"
Bob Ross,There we go. Well lay another little ridge of foothills right down through there
Bob Ross,"Well give those a little upward swirl. Just barely, barely touching the canvas here. Okay"
Bob Ross,Now we can start coming forward
Bob Ross,And well take a little bit of sap green mixed with a little bit of alizarin and then Ill mix that into some yellow
Bob Ross,Makes sort of a dirty green color and well start putting some little trees that are way back here
Bob Ross,Load a lot of paint in your brush and just push upward
Bob Ross,"There, all these little things happening way back in the distance"
Bob Ross,And maybe just a little touch of yellow right here
Bob Ross,Just let this blend right with the color that you had. Let it go
Bob Ross,Now Im gonna take and pull just the edges down
Bob Ross,Dont overwork this because youre working with yellow into the blue water and itll just turn it bright green on ya
Bob Ross,"Just pull it down, hypnotize it a little bit, and leave it alone"
Bob Ross,Now we can put a few little sticks here and there. Just cutting through the paint is all were doing
Bob Ross,Make it look like little trunks way back in the distance
Bob Ross,Well take just a little touch of phthalo green mixed with a cad yellow and a little bit of permanent red
Bob Ross,And well put some highlights on these trees
Bob Ross,Just where the suns running through there and sparkling on top of em. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now, some straight vandyke brown and we just lay us a little, little bit of dirt and gravel and stuff in here"
Bob Ross,This isnt straight magic white and were just gonna lay it right underneath here just to give us a little water line
Bob Ross,"And when youre doing this at home, youll have a lot more time than we do here"
Bob Ross,You can take your time and put in all the little fantastic details that you want to back here. Okay
Bob Ross,Lets begin moving this in a little bit closer. Using the same colors
Bob Ross,Well just start coming forward. Maybe we need a nice tall little tree right here
Bob Ross,Lets put us a little bush over here also. Cant leave this side out. There we go. Just lay that in
Bob Ross,"Ya know, wed love to hear from ya and love to hear how youre doing with all this and if its helping you"
Bob Ross,Wed like to know what you wanna see on these shows
Bob Ross,"If you wanna see different things painted, different techniques"
Bob Ross,"Wed also maybe like to, in the future, bring some of the better instructors that we have met across the United States and maybe well have them demonstrate some unbelievable techniques that can be done"
Bob Ross,"But we need to know what you want, so let us know"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take a little bit of the brown and well just lay some little trunks here and there"
Bob Ross,Maybe well give this little bush one here. And well put some highlights on that
Bob Ross,Still fascinates me how this works and how beautifully it works
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets see, maybe we need a little, there, thats it"
Bob Ross,"And down in here, we need some little bushes that are hiding underneath this bigger one"
Bob Ross,And well put some little reflections in the water. There we go. Little red fireball there. Okay
Bob Ross,Little touch more of the magic white just to thin it down a touch
Bob Ross,Lets go over here and well put some nice little highlights on this tree. There we go
Bob Ross,Leave a lot of these dark areas in here. They create the shadows that you need so desperately
Bob Ross,And well put a little color right here for reflections
Bob Ross,"Then we can lay a little color right on top to give us nice, beautiful reflections. Right there"
Bob Ross,Okay
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take a little more of the straight brown and a little bit right along here and well just draw in some little bit of shore, little bank here"
Bob Ross,"Lay a little highlight on top of that. Touch here. Okay, lets see what we got going here"
Bob Ross,Looks like we have a lot of space up in here that we really need to do something with
Bob Ross,"So, lets do this. This is alizarin, crimson, little bit of sap green"
Bob Ross,Now weve gotta do something up here cause weve thrown all this color in here. There we go
Bob Ross,"Maybe well put a little bit right out here too. Looks so good, we might as well not stop"
Bob Ross,Well take a little bit of vandyke brown and lets do us an almighty tree coming right up through here
Bob Ross,There he is
Bob Ross,"And youre just sort of pulling this sideways to lay the paint right on the canvas, let it pull off the knife"
Bob Ross,And maybe we can give him some little arms out here. There we go. And theres another one
Bob Ross,"And maybe this is a separate little entity, little tree by itself growing down here"
Bob Ross,Just a little sprout off the big one. Now we can put some highlights on these leaves
Bob Ross,And just let it touch. Bend the bristles just the least little bit. There we go. Few over here
Bob Ross,Isnt that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast
Bob Ross,Well put a little highlight here in this one too. Dont want him to feel left out
Bob Ross,Lets put a little something over here to give this a feel of bark. Just here and there. There we go
Bob Ross,"Lets see. Maybe over here. Lets be brave. Lets put an old, dead tree right up through here"
Bob Ross,And this old tree is tired. Hes just about to fall down. Not too much left for him
Bob Ross,Well give him a little tired arm. There we go. And here and there. Just let these happen. Good
Bob Ross,Maybe another little stick right there. Alrighty
Bob Ross,"Now, maybe well do something a little touch different here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little bit of the permanent red and sorta highlight this old tree, just run it down through there"
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"And if we wanted to make a few more little branches on this tree, we can take a little bit of the thin oil and thin this down and we can lay just a few more little branches here and there"
Bob Ross,Just a few thats hangin on. Most of em have already fallen off
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well put something here to cover up his foot, so it pushes him back down in there"
Bob Ross,Lets do the same thing over here. Need to push him back into the picture
Bob Ross,And maybe we can take a little more of the sap green and alizarin combination and lets do this
Bob Ross,Maybe well just project this right on out toward us here. Give him some highlights
Bob Ross,"Okay, there we go"
Bob Ross,"By now, if youre painting at home with us, you should begin having a picture thats getting close to being completed"
Bob Ross,Should have listed your spirits up very high and ready to go to another one
Bob Ross,We just put a little magic white under here to give us a little water line like so
Bob Ross,"And lets put a few little sticks here and there. Okay, there"
Bob Ross,"Now, this is a most interesting picture because of the mountains and once again, the biggest thing wed like for you to learn from this one is the laying of clouds in front of mountains and how to make these mountains be pushed far, far away"
Bob Ross,"Okay, these little sticks show all different planes. They create the illusion of distance"
Bob Ross,"Okay, I think this ones just about ready for a signature"
Bob Ross,"So, well take a little of the thin oil, mix it up real good, make it almost like water here"
Bob Ross,And well just lay a little signature right there
Bob Ross,"And Im very fortunate cause I have a short name so, only takes me a second to do so"
Bob Ross,And I think well call that one finished
Bob Ross,"If we mess with it any more, were gonna start fiddling it to death"
Bob Ross,"Do your picture, get your dream out on canvas and leave it alone. Dont fiddle with it all day"
Bob Ross,"In the time you spend fiddling, you could do another picture"
Bob Ross,"So, thank you very, very much for watching us"
Bob Ross,"We hope to see you again and until then, happy painting. calm piano"
Bob Ross,- Welcome back
Bob Ross,Today Id thought wed do a little picture thats little different than what weve been doing
Bob Ross,"And today I wanna emphasize how to do several ranges of mountains and have some in the background that are very quiet, and very distant and then come forward with it and lets see what happens here"
Bob Ross,"Ive already prepared the canvas with a layer of magic white, just brushed in both directions"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well start with a little bit of Persian blue and were really working to the bristles of the brush"
Bob Ross,And well start right at the top working across and were picking up the magic white as we go across here and automatically it makes the sky get lighter as it works downward
Bob Ross,We dont want a sky that just looks like you pulled the curtain down. Were trying to avoid those
Bob Ross,"Okay, let me real hypnotize it a little bit. Okay"
Bob Ross,"And while weve got some blue on the brush here, we might as well go ahead and put in a little bit of water here"
Bob Ross,"This is still the Persian blue. And well just hypnotize this a little bit, bring it all together"
Bob Ross,"Anyway it doesnt matter where you get your waterline here because when you put all the other stuff in, you can bring it to whatever points you want it so dont worry about it"
Bob Ross,Okay. We will wash this old brush
Bob Ross,"Alrighty, lets take some blue and a little bit of brown and little bit of white just to make a gray color, blue gray here"
Bob Ross,"And maybe were gonna have this mountain come way up on the canvas, what the heck"
Bob Ross,And just let it roll around
Bob Ross,Were gonna have a little bump right there and let it wander right on off
Bob Ross,"Very little paint and were pushing that paint right into the canvas, just really push it"
Bob Ross,"And well put a little bump right there, another little hill"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well take and pull that paint down"
Bob Ross,We want it to get lighter as it goes toward the horizon here. So we pull it down
Bob Ross,Once again its mixing with the magic white thats already on the canvas and automatically this occurs
Bob Ross,Pull this one down a little. Okay. Like so
Bob Ross,"Now this time we want very little paint, very little paint"
Bob Ross,"All we wanna do is give little indications back here. Just a little, few little highlights"
Bob Ross,Light plane right through here
Bob Ross,"And youll find if youre right handed, its normally easier to have the light coming from the right"
Bob Ross,If youre left handed it will vary from person to person
Bob Ross,"So you have to find whats comfortable for you, and maybe a little spec of light back here on that point"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe well just let these two work their way together here"
Bob Ross,Just make an almighty ridge coming right through there. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now, for the shadow well use a little blue and white, little touch of brown with it"
Bob Ross,Lets put a little shadow right here
Bob Ross,"Dont want a great deal in the shadows this time, just a little bit"
Bob Ross,Maybe a little touch over in here. Few little things happening all along the way
Bob Ross,Little bit too straight so Im gonna break that up a little so it doesnt look too round
Bob Ross,"Dont want it to look phony, want it to look real. Okay now Im gonna really diffuse this one"
Bob Ross,"I want it to just about disappear. Even gonna work a little bit in there, and well lift upward"
Bob Ross,Always follow the angles that youve built in your mountain. Always work with those angles
Bob Ross,"Okay now lets build another one, little closer"
Bob Ross,"This time Im gonna put a little Alizarin in blue to give it a little bit more of a purplish, little touch of brown to dull it"
Bob Ross,All right. And lets take this one and run right up through here
Bob Ross,Now this being so dark should push everything back. Maybe a little bump there
Bob Ross,Want this just to be a nice slow lowling a little hill
Bob Ross,"And just get in there and do it, thing like that. Dont worry about it, let it happen. There"
Bob Ross,And well pull this down a little bit
Bob Ross,"One reason we do so many mountains in this series is to teach you to use the knife that you can make mountains, youve made friends with the knife then you can do just about anything you wanna do with it"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe well take a little blue and white here"
Bob Ross,Maybe theres a few little patches of snow laying on this just here and there
Bob Ross,Just let those work down here and there. There
Bob Ross,And maybe theres a little snow land right in here somewhere. Just sort of bring that together
Bob Ross,Okay and well take a little bit of the blue and brown and put some sap green with it
Bob Ross,"There we go, very dark, it should look black. And now well load the brush up"
Bob Ross,And lets just do some little things like this
Bob Ross,I want some little indication of trees way back in the distance back here
Bob Ross,And maybe a few of them have just a little bit more detail so we can just add a little bit here and there
Bob Ross,Were only looking for basic shapes as far back. You would not see a great deal of detail
Bob Ross,And here and there nice little trees. Add a little more shape. Okay
Bob Ross,"A lot of paint on the brush, very, very thick. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then we can take and just scratch a few little trunks here and there"
Bob Ross,And all were doing here is using the point of the knife and cutting through the paint so the canvas shows
Bob Ross,And it gives the illusion of little trunks way back in the distance
Bob Ross,And you dont have to worry about cutting through the canvas with this knife
Bob Ross,"The canvas is very, very strong and we recommend that you use stretch canvas rather than canvas boards"
Bob Ross,The canvas boards have cardboard in the center and they have a tendency to absorb your magic white very rapidly and leave you with a dry canvas
Bob Ross,And we depend on this being wet through the whole picture
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets take little gray, a little yellow and red all mixed together here and lets start putting some land coming down through here"
Bob Ross,And all were gonna do is just push. Like so. All the little grassy things happening here
Bob Ross,"And maybe here and there we can see little parts of the dirt showing through, little areas where theres some ground showing"
Bob Ross,So we just lay that in
Bob Ross,"And then you can just go back and push it down into the picture, put things that are projecting over it"
Bob Ross,"Little more magic here, have to have a thin paint to make it stick on all these"
Bob Ross,"And as these come out of the shadow, let them get a little brighter"
Bob Ross,These trees with shadow all back in there. So you want this to get a little brighter as it comes out
Bob Ross,There we go. And lets take and pull just a little bit of this down into the water. There we go
Bob Ross,"And then well just, just hypnotize it a little bit, just make it come together"
Bob Ross,Here Im adding just a little bit of dark
Bob Ross,"We have two light areas so well put a touch of dark in here just to separate these, very, very little paint"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets take a little Vandyke brown and well just go right along here and build me some little shore"
Bob Ross,Here all were doing is touching the canvas
Bob Ross,"Okay, and we can put a few little sticks in here while we have some color on the knife"
Bob Ross,"You know what, when people see all these little sticks and stuff, they think youve spent days and days with your one haired brush sitting here doing all these little rascals, and when you get them believing that then you up the price of it"
Bob Ross,For a long time Ive painted this way in the secrecy of my home and charged unbelievable prices which a lot of painters are doing now
Bob Ross,But if people see it takes you 30 minutes then they dont wanna pay you an unbelievable price for it
Bob Ross,"They wanna pay you 30 minutes labor, so you have to make a decision whether you wanna be a traditional artist or an artist that eats regular"
Bob Ross,"And well lay some little ripples along the water here, just here and there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now maybe well take some of this dark color and lets put a little tree right here, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"Like so. And well take and pull some of that paint down, make this little reflection"
Bob Ross,Put a little tree trunk in. And well lay a little highlight right along here just so it stands out
Bob Ross,And then we need some leaves on it so Im gonna drop a few little leaves here and there. There we go
Bob Ross,"Very light touch, dont want to destroy. And well use just a little bit of the Vandyke here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets put something in the foreground"
Bob Ross,We will have all kind of nice little bushes and stuff just growing around here
Bob Ross,And lets put something right here. There we go. And well highlight these real quick
Bob Ross,"Look at that, all those little leaves and bushes and you can do it"
Bob Ross,"You can do it, just practice a little, load a lot of paint to the brush"
Bob Ross,Remember thin paints stick to a thick paint. Maybe just a little greenery on this
Bob Ross,"A little something right there. Okay, a few little sticks. Now lets get brave"
Bob Ross,Lets have a huge limb coming out here like theres a three over here somewhere and all you can see is a big limb coming out
Bob Ross,I know this is scary to take in and put something like this right out through all the work you went through but give it a try one time
Bob Ross,And maybe we have one coming down through here
Bob Ross,"And then we can have some little limbs coming off these, all kinds of little things happening here"
Bob Ross,Wherever you want them just drop them in
Bob Ross,And theres a little something just protruding right up here
Bob Ross,"Okay, now you could put just a little bit of highlight on here just to break it up"
Bob Ross,Shows a little sunlight is hitting. Yeah
Bob Ross,"Now lets lay some leaves on top of them and we first need some dark, let me get some dark color here"
Bob Ross,"A little bit of sap, a little bit of blue and brown. There we go"
Bob Ross,And wed lay a little color on the brush here and now were just gonna start tapping where we want some nice little leaves to be
Bob Ross,Just let them fall in there. There
Bob Ross,Just sort of helps make a nice composition of your picture and push everything back
Bob Ross,Think youll like this once you try it
Bob Ross,And as I say first time is sort of the son of a gun distance through all these right up in the middle of your picture
Bob Ross,Its gonna scare you a little bit. But jump in there and do it. Remember youre the master
Bob Ross,This canvas is afraid of you. Youre the master
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we can take a lighter color green, a little more magic in it"
Bob Ross,And well load this brush full and think where your light is coming from
Bob Ross,The top of these are gonna be a little brighter than the bottom so well just lay a little bit of color right along the top here
Bob Ross,This is where you need a good brush though. Be very careful about the brush you use
Bob Ross,"Avoid nylon brushes, they cut paint. These are natural bristle brushes. Put the color right in here"
Bob Ross,I always remember back when I was a traditional painter how long I would agonize trying to do something like this with the little one haired brush and working for days and days and days to get an effect that you can now get in minutes
Bob Ross,Okay
Bob Ross,"There we go, and we have almighty limbs projecting right out in our picture and makes it look like theres a tree over here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe, maybe right in here. Lets do this"
Bob Ross,Lets have an old tree thats falling over coming right up through here
Bob Ross,"If you got all your nerve up and done this one, shoot, we might as well just keep going with it"
Bob Ross,No use letting you stop now. And maybe he had a little friend that fell over with him. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now dont laugh, trees need friends too. Everybody needs friends. Okay"
Bob Ross,Take a little white and little brown here
Bob Ross,Now youll put just a least little touch of sort of an orangey color in it
Bob Ross,"And were gonna just work that right down here and make him look old and tired, just barely touching"
Bob Ross,Just pull that right along like so. Let it go
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well take and put a few little bushes in front so he has a place for his foot to sit"
Bob Ross,"And well take the liner brush, a little bit of thin oil like so. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And well put a few little limbs hanging on here that are just about going, just here and there"
Bob Ross,"Let them go wherever which way, whatever makes them happy. And maybe this one is just hanging down"
Bob Ross,"Hes tired, poor old thing. There"
Bob Ross,"This old tree is just about going, its gonna fall over here in the pond"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little limb or two left up here, something like so"
Bob Ross,"Okay, I think well sign that one and call it finished and there we go"
Bob Ross,"And Id like to thank you very, very much for watching us today"
Bob Ross,"I hope youve enjoyed this painting and that youve painted along with us and until next time, happy painting"
Bob Ross,"Thank you very, very much. lively music calm music"
Bob Ross,"- Well, welcome back"
Bob Ross,"Thought today wed do a little picture that maybe has got a little calm ocean, and"
Bob Ross,"And well play with clouds today, well play with light reflecting all though the clouds, and see what kind thing we can come up with here"
Bob Ross,"And were gonna start out, Im gonna take a little bit of yellow, and just a little bit of Permanent Red, and were gonna work with the sun today"
Bob Ross,Were gonna put the sun in here
Bob Ross,"Now Ive already covered the canvas with a thin layer of Magic White, save a little time"
Bob Ross,"Next well go into a little bit of white, and a touch of Alizarin Crimson"
Bob Ross,And well work that a little bit. And maybe very gently. And always making these little X patterns
Bob Ross,"There we go, just work it right on back into here"
Bob Ross,"And then Im gonna go into a little Alizarin, a little touch of Prussian Blue"
Bob Ross,"It makes sort of a, oh like a little lavender color here"
Bob Ross,And well just work that from out here inward. Well play with some crazy colors in the sky today
Bob Ross,Just come right on around with it like that. There we go
Bob Ross,"I know somebodys out there sayin already, sure dont look like the sun to me"
Bob Ross,"Now lets take the big brush, and were gonna start bringing all this together, very gently"
Bob Ross,"There we go. See how all those colors just blend together. Now well hypnotize it, just a little bit"
Bob Ross,"And while Ive got this brush dirty, Ill take just a little touch of the blue"
Bob Ross,And lavender mixed together here. And well do this. And bring it right in here
Bob Ross,"We dont wanna destroy this nice, reflected light area that were putting into the water already"
Bob Ross,Just very gently bring all this together. There we go. Clean up the brush
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take a little Titanium White"
Bob Ross,"Load the brush full, and well go right into the center of this"
Bob Ross,"Well grind that into the canvas, just really push that color in. There"
Bob Ross,"And well take the knife, and take off the excess paint. The value remains in the canvas"
Bob Ross,And now we can work with that a little bit
Bob Ross,"And the first color we put on, turns out to be the aura thats around the sun. Okay, now"
Bob Ross,"We can play with some almighty clouds here, and well take a little brown, and a little blue"
Bob Ross,Make up a nice little color here. Sort of a grey color. And lets build some almighty clouds
Bob Ross,And we just let these run right across the sun
Bob Ross,"Be careful not to put too much blue into this, you want it to grey, otherwise when you hit that yellow, its gonna turn green on you"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Nice fluffy little cloud. Just layin around here in the sky, bein lazy"
Bob Ross,Okay maybe well have another little cloud up here. Just let him play. There he goes
Bob Ross,Now lets put some highlights on these clouds
Bob Ross,And right close to the sun here I want them to be quite bright. There
Bob Ross,"Little bit more into the orangey type, pinkish hue. There we go, thats better"
Bob Ross,And a little brighter on this edge right here. And there we are. Just lay these on
Bob Ross,Let all these pretty little colors just sort of float through the clouds
Bob Ross,And mix the color in your brush. That way you have a multitude of colors all in one brush
Bob Ross,"Now on this cloud, the light, as you can see, is coming from the other direction"
Bob Ross,So its gonna hit the bottom of the cloud more than the top
Bob Ross,And well put some little sparkles here and there. There we go
Bob Ross,Maybe some little highlights just playing around
Bob Ross,"Now well take the big brush, and very gently, super, super light, just enough to bring this together"
Bob Ross,Just wanna blend them together. Little little bit. Build some of the highlights here and there
Bob Ross,"Now we can hypnotize the whole thing. If you havent used a firm paint, now youre in trouble"
Bob Ross,"So be sure your paint is very, very firm"
Bob Ross,"Now lets put some little small clouds, just lay it along here"
Bob Ross,"Just little stringy clouds, I call em. For lack of a better name"
Bob Ross,"And well take a little bit of color, and highlight these clouds. Just across the top"
Bob Ross,"Just like the sunlights bouncing along here, and playing and having fun. There"
Bob Ross,"Now well gently hypnotize these, and Just bring em right into the picture. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now well take just a little touch of Magic White. We need a thin paint, thin, thin paint here"
Bob Ross,"Be sure youre finished with your sky when you do this, cause its just about over once you start this"
Bob Ross,Well put some little light rays comin through here. Just indications
Bob Ross,Like youre bouncing through and playin. Just enough to give it a little indication back here
Bob Ross,"Now lets see, way back here, very lightly. Lets just make us a little water line back in here"
Bob Ross,"Like so. Thought wed do like a nice bay, or something like that. The waters not violently rough"
Bob Ross,"Just nice, few little ripples here and there. Few little waves coming in. Just work those around"
Bob Ross,"Now as we get up closer here, lets have a little wave in here, just like so"
Bob Ross,Put this little darker color in so itll stand out. Maybe just a little one back in here
Bob Ross,Little dark underneath these
Bob Ross,"Now we take a little bit of white, little Magic White with it, and were gonna push"
Bob Ross,Little bit of foam on top of that water. Sort of pull that down
Bob Ross,And maybe here its already curled over. And we just lift that right over like that
Bob Ross,A little bit in here
Bob Ross,"Now if youre doing this at home, when it dries, take little dots of white paint, and just lay all in here, and itll look like the lights just sparkling, right across the water, with just little dots of white paint"
Bob Ross,Dont over do it. Just little foamy things happening all throughout here
Bob Ross,"Very light, we dont want anything real bright back here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, I think Ill take a little Alizarin Crimson, and Sap Green mixed together to make a nice brown color"
Bob Ross,"Warm, warm brown, since weve used the Alizarin in here"
Bob Ross,"And brown is such a nice color, its a very warm, peaceful color"
Bob Ross,Maybe well put some little things like this in here. There we go
Bob Ross,"Put some little grassy things, layin here on the beach. There"
Bob Ross,And lets take a little bit of the Prussian Blue
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little place layin right in here, where the water sort of formed"
Bob Ross,So well put just a little more blue right here. Like so. There we go
Bob Ross,Now Im gonna make a mixture of brown and white. And well make some sand here on the beach
Bob Ross,And we just let this knife work right down through here. Very gently
Bob Ross,Try to get the paint to break like that. Maybe well go back right over here
Bob Ross,Maybe well have this coming right down through here
Bob Ross,And we can start putting all these little bushes and weeds that grow out here on the sand
Bob Ross,This is still the Sap Green and Alizarin Crimson. There we go. And follow the lay of the land here
Bob Ross,You want it to look like its sorta coming down
Bob Ross,"If were gonna have a little pool of water here, you need to have it coming down"
Bob Ross,So it just works in there. There we go
Bob Ross,And we can take and lay a little bit of sand right down through here
Bob Ross,Lets start with some reflections in this water. Little touch right here
Bob Ross,Lets build some nice little reflections in this little pool thats laying here
Bob Ross,Now we come ahead and decide where we want the dirt to come. Maybe itll come right out like that
Bob Ross,Lets put a little thing right out here. There we go. Very lightly
Bob Ross,And we can bring some Over in here. Maybe this one comes way off
Bob Ross,It would if I didnt run out of paint. There we go. Lay that in there
Bob Ross,Now we take a little bit of Magic White
Bob Ross,And well put some little things happening around the waters edge here. Just here and there
Bob Ross,Always have a lot of foam that builds up around the sea
Bob Ross,So well just have all those little foamy things in here. Little bit over here
Bob Ross,So it looks like that just sort of slips on into the background there. And off and away
Bob Ross,"Now we can put a few more little things in here, just to build this up"
Bob Ross,Still following the lay of the land. Arighty. Lets take some brown here
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put like an old snow fence, coming down through here I think"
Bob Ross,So well start with straight Van Dyke Brown. And these old fences are
Bob Ross,Made out of just whatever happens to be available
Bob Ross,"So theyre all different sizes, all different shapes"
Bob Ross,"The wind and the weather, they tear them apart and they really get bad looking"
Bob Ross,So well just lay them in here. Some of em are just about to rot
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little short one right here. Give him a little more, there"
Bob Ross,"This one over here, maybe he just comes like so. Every which way, ever which way"
Bob Ross,And well just let these happen
Bob Ross,"Sometimes theyre close together, sometimes theyre far apart, so wherever you want. There"
Bob Ross,"And maybe ones just about to fall over, there he goes"
Bob Ross,"Now Ill take a little touch of the light color here, and Im gonna just put a little touch of light"
Bob Ross,"Right on the edge of these, just here and there. This is just brown and white. Just a little bit"
Bob Ross,Those do look nice and old. Theyve been hangin around the beach for a long time. There we go
Bob Ross,Now take a little bit of paint here. And lets just make this old thing just wander around
Bob Ross,"ITs just about had it. Come right on down, there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this one has a bunch on the other side, so we just keep on cutting through"
Bob Ross,"Come through like this. And lets give him one more. That went so well lets do another one, there"
Bob Ross,"Now if your really wanna spruce these up a little bit, you can put just a little bit on top here"
Bob Ross,"Lets use just a little touch lighter color, so it shows up, there"
Bob Ross,Just a little light playin along the corner
Bob Ross,"And use the small edge of this knife, too, dont just use the. Other edge. Now then, lets"
Bob Ross,"Lets put a nice little tree right here. We need an old, tired tree"
Bob Ross,Thats live right next to the ocean all of its life
Bob Ross,"Its not the best place in the world for an old tree to live. There, boy he looks tired already"
Bob Ross,"LEts give him another little helper here. There we go. Okay, lets use the little liner brush here"
Bob Ross,And just put some highlights right along here. Let those sort of fade back
Bob Ross,Give him a few more little branches. This is just a thin oil
Bob Ross,Thats mixed with a paint so its a little bit thinner. And then it flows better
Bob Ross,He comes right along. Like that
Bob Ross,"And we just put a few little limbs at random, and then well put some leaves on him"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right in here, maybe theres the one thats just tired, hes hangin down. There"
Bob Ross,Poor old tree. Okay. Well take a little bit of. Little Alizarin and the Sap Green again
Bob Ross,"Maybe dull it down with a little bit of brown, we dont want this very bright. Alright, thats nice"
Bob Ross,Just put some little leaves on here. There we go
Bob Ross,Just drop the little rascals on wherever you want em
Bob Ross,"Maybe well just put these back, and let this limb protrude on through"
Bob Ross,Maybe hes already got tired one on strike. Just layin out there by himself
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit of. Green, a little yellow"
Bob Ross,And I put just a little touch of brown with it to dull it
Bob Ross,"Once again, I dont want this to be a bright, bright tree. I want this to be quite dull"
Bob Ross,Put a few little highlights here. There we go. Just here and there. Alright
Bob Ross,We can go back and fill in some more of these little busy areas. Just to give him a little
Bob Ross,"Character. There, thats nice"
Bob Ross,"Take a little Alizarin Crimson and brown here, and maybe well just put a few little things that are trying to grow here"
Bob Ross,"Lifes sort of rough out here, so hes not doin too great. Just here and there"
Bob Ross,Maybe theres one layin over here. This is a very quiet little seascape. Something you can do
Bob Ross,"Its just a little practice, and I think youll enjoy it"
Bob Ross,Its probably the most fun working with a sky. Theres a multitude of things you can do here
Bob Ross,"Theres no limit to the different colors you can use, you can change em to any color that pleases you"
Bob Ross,"Feel free. Were not trying to teach you to copy here, were trying to teach you a technique"
Bob Ross,And how you use that technique is strictly up to you. Youre only limited by your imagination
Bob Ross,"So let it go, have fun with it, practice. And you too can be an almighty painter"
Bob Ross,I think well very quickly sign this picture
Bob Ross,"And well call it finished, so well take a little bit of. Thin paint here. Just do that"
Bob Ross,"I wanna thank you very very much for watching us today, I hope you have enjoyed this picture, its a little different than what weve done in the past"
Bob Ross,"But it gives you some more ideas of what you can do. Until next time, happy painting. guitar music"
Bob Ross,"- Well hello, hope you have your canvas set up and ready to go, I think well do another almighty picture"
Bob Ross,"And today, I wanna do a ridge of mountains, rather than the jagged, sharp mountains that weve been doing, I wanna do a nice, smooth little ridge of mountains, coming down into a beautiful little lake"
Bob Ross,"So well start off here with a little bit of Prussian blue on the big brush, there we go, just work it into the bristles, and well start right at the top of the canvas"
Bob Ross,"OK, well put us a quick little sky in here, and well just move this paint around, let it work, play"
Bob Ross,Dont want a dead sky. calming piano music OK
Bob Ross,"Now Ive already had the magic white on the canvas before I started so, we have that ready, there we go, just nice little sky with some life in it"
Bob Ross,"Now I put just a touch of fatal green with my color, and well put in some water. There we go"
Bob Ross,And sort of bring all that together
Bob Ross,"Weve left a little area open right here in the center, so that itll look like a sheen of light coming across the water"
Bob Ross,OK
Bob Ross,"brush splashing in water brush banging on metal There you go, just redecorated your living room"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take a little bit of the titanium white, and just a little touch of permanent red in it, always like to put a little bit of pink into my clouds, just so it looks like a little sunshine"
Bob Ross,"And well do some almighty big clouds here, just let em work off that brush, keep the brush moving"
Bob Ross,Keep it moving
Bob Ross,"You dont wanna set and grind one spot to death, all youll do is end up with huge cotton balls in the sky"
Bob Ross,And we want nice fluffy clouds
Bob Ross,"Leave some of these areas dark, thatll end up being the shadows in your cloud. OK. There we go"
Bob Ross,Maybe well just have a little cloud floating around up in the sky up here. There we are
Bob Ross,"Now maybe another nice little cloud, with just a little touch more pink with that one"
Bob Ross,"There, now he stands out, we just want these to be soft little clouds. OK"
Bob Ross,"Now well take the big brush, and very gently hypnotize this, just work it a little bit, leave it alone"
Bob Ross,"If you overwork it, youve killed your cloud and youve become a cloud killer, ooh, nothing worse than a cloud killer"
Bob Ross,"There, fluff it up a little, and dont worry if you pull little streaks of paint out when you do that, because when you hypnotize it itll go away"
Bob Ross,"There, well just hypnotize the whole thing now. OK lets clean the brush"
Bob Ross,brush splashing in water There we go. And lets put one more little cloud in there
Bob Ross,"Well just have him right here, just let him work around"
Bob Ross,"If youre gonna separate these two clouds, you need the dark area in between, so dont kill all your darker area"
Bob Ross,"There, there. Blend him in a little bit, fluff him up, then hypnotize him. OK"
Bob Ross,Now lets start working on this ridge of mountains here
Bob Ross,"And were gonna take a little blue and brown, I wanna make sort of a grey color here, blue, brown and white"
Bob Ross,"And your blue is a hundred times stronger than the brown, so use it sparingly. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets just take in, lay us in a nice little ridge here, and were really pushing this into the canvas, work it hard, working hard"
Bob Ross,"Push, youre not gonna hurt that canvas. Just a few little bumps here and there on top"
Bob Ross,"We really push that color into the canvas, there"
Bob Ross,"Now we take the big brush, and well pull this downward. There we go"
Bob Ross,Get rid of all that excess paint
Bob Ross,"And its blending with the magic white as you pull it down, and automatically it gets lighter in value toward the bottom"
Bob Ross,"OK. OK, lets clean the old brush. brush banging on metal There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take a little bit of white, and Im gonna grey it a little bit, just to make it a little bit duller"
Bob Ross,"And over here Im gonna make up a little shadow color, and its brown, white and a little bit of blue, so we can work back and forth between highlights and shadows"
Bob Ross,"Little bitty, little little bitty roll of paint on your knife, almost no paint"
Bob Ross,Want this to be very subdued. There we go
Bob Ross,"There, just let this come on down, this should look almost like cliffs"
Bob Ross,Just with a light striking here and there. OK. Little bit of the shadow color played here and there
Bob Ross,"I think youll find that, doing these kind of mountains, are a little more difficult than the other ones we were doing, where we used more paint"
Bob Ross,"These here, almost non-existent when it comes to paint. OK"
Bob Ross,"Then well take the big brush and diffuse this, make it even softer, push it even farther back"
Bob Ross,Like so. Really pushing back. OK maybe well put a little ridge coming right around here sorta
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"You could spend all day just playing with mountains, and its a super, super way to learn, so, if you have an old canvas around take it, and just do nothing but mountains on it, the whole thing"
Bob Ross,"It really, really will make friend of that knife by the time youre finished"
Bob Ross,"And itll help you to understand mountains, everybodys not as fortunate as I who can live in Alaska where you can look out your window and view mountains that most people only see in pictures"
Bob Ross,"Alrighty, lets bring this down, maybe well just have it come right into here. There we go"
Bob Ross,"OK, and if you dont have mountains outside of your window, you can buy a lot of books that have pictures in it, and examples, and after a very short period of time youll begin making these up in your own mind, you no longer have to worry about copying, but copying is a way to start"
Bob Ross,"In here were trying to give you something, just sorta as a guideline to go by, and to make your own vision, and to put it on canvas"
Bob Ross,"So dont worry about trying to copy exactly what Im doing here, do what you wanna do, put your feelings into it, your heart, its your world"
Bob Ross,OK. And maybe a few little things here and there. A few little shadows
Bob Ross,"And maybe well just change some of these angles here a little, there we go, I like that better"
Bob Ross,"See its your mountain, you can change it. You can change it anyway you want him to be"
Bob Ross,"Well put some little shadows here and there, just to make some little projections coming out, wherever you want em"
Bob Ross,"OK. Now, lets diffuse this, lay it in the mist here. Very soft"
Bob Ross,"Now I must take a little magic white, little magic white"
Bob Ross,"We need a thinner paint, if were gonna make some happy little clouds that just sort of float down over the mountain here, and maybe well just take this one right here, and just let him float right on down over the mountain"
Bob Ross,"Now, its essential that you have a thick paint on first, it is essential, absolutely necessary, or all you do is make mud here"
Bob Ross,OK maybe theres a little cloud just floating right down through there. OK
Bob Ross,"We just lay these clouds where we want em. Heck, maybe this one comes down over here too"
Bob Ross,"Very thin paint, cant stress that enough. OK"
Bob Ross,"Now, very, very gently, a hair just about touches, not quite, just about. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And then well hypnotize it, ever so lightly. Super, super lightly, there"
Bob Ross,See how easy it is to put clouds just drifting right over the mountain
Bob Ross,brush splashing in water OK
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take, lets take a little sap green, and a little brown mixed together"
Bob Ross,"OK lets see here, lets take, oh got a big old hair, and it aint right here on the brush"
Bob Ross,"If you get a hair on the canvas, just take the corner of your brush, and lift it right off"
Bob Ross,No big deal
Bob Ross,If you take your finger and start picking youll destroy your whole picture trying to get that one little son of a gun off there
Bob Ross,"OK now, well just lay in some color here, maybe Ill add just a little touch of blue to that"
Bob Ross,"Yeah, I like that better. There we go"
Bob Ross,"OK, now then, we can take and grab the hold of a little bit of that, pull it down, instant reflections, instant reflections"
Bob Ross,Pull that across
Bob Ross,"OK, now we can highlight a little bit, well take a little bit of the magic white, a little yellow and a touch of thalo green"
Bob Ross,Nice bright little green here
Bob Ross,"And, theyll lay in some nice little things happening all over the place. There we go"
Bob Ross,OK lets reflect a little bit of that color right down into the water here. OK
Bob Ross,"Now, lets mix up some blue, and some brown, and some sap green, and you want this very dark, it looks black"
Bob Ross,"And, well use the almighty fan brush today, make some little trees in the background"
Bob Ross,"Weve used just about every brush here, so just show you how you can make some beautiful little trees with this"
Bob Ross,"And you just sort of let em fall of the brush, back and forth, shape your tree, and lay em in there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well put one a little higher, that way well put the cloud, that little cloud thats floating in front of the mountain, well put him behind the tree"
Bob Ross,"There we go. These are fun little trees to make, just let em happen. OK, maybe one over here"
Bob Ross,"His top got bent a little bit, maybe airplane went too close and clipped him"
Bob Ross,"In Alaska thats not unusual, they have some crazy old bush pilots up there that run over everything"
Bob Ross,"Friend of mine brought back a 12-foot tree hanging on his, back of his airplane"
Bob Ross,OK maybe a little baby one over here. OK
Bob Ross,"Then well just pull that down into the reflections, very gently, like so. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now well take some magic white, and a little bit of Van Dyke brown, a little touch of yellow, just to make sort of a dirt color, sandy little color, and well lay in some little waterlines back here"
Bob Ross,"And maybe well have a little beach comes down. There, and that just run around the corner"
Bob Ross,"OK, there you goes"
Bob Ross,"Well take a dry brush, and we lift this just a touch, this is a thinner paint so itll move on top of the other without destroying"
Bob Ross,"OK, now just some straight magic white and well sparkle this up a little bit. OK"
Bob Ross,"Well put a few little sticks and stems here and there. OK, time to move forward in this picture"
Bob Ross,Well mix us up a little more dark color. OK
Bob Ross,"Lets put some paint on the one-inch brush, and build us another tree here"
Bob Ross,Maybe we got a nice evergreen thats growing right up through here. There you go son
Bob Ross,"Just let him drip out of the brush. And well give him a little friend. There, we go, alright"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets just put some little bushy trees right in here, like this, some little reflections underneath"
Bob Ross,"Pull those down. OK. And well put some little trunk indicators, just here and there"
Bob Ross,"Alrighty, now we can highlight that. And well throw a nice little green bush right here"
Bob Ross,"Theres a nice little tree. OK, there. Well reflect those right down into the water"
Bob Ross,And give them a little pull
Bob Ross,"OK, little Van Dyke brown, and well put some soil in here, and well just sort of let this come around"
Bob Ross,"Then a little brown and white, a highlighty, make him look like stones and stuff"
Bob Ross,"Few little bushes that travel down, there we go. There we go. OK"
Bob Ross,"And well put a little waterline under here, and this is still water so it has to be flat, all these lines have to be straight"
Bob Ross,"Go anywhere you wanna go with them but they have to basically be straight, or your waters gonna run out of your picture, youre gonna have to get a bucket and put it under one end"
Bob Ross,Lets put a few little sticks here and there. Alright
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take some brown, and do this, shwip, just let this go. OK"
Bob Ross,"Really pushing that into the canvas, really pushing it. OK"
Bob Ross,"And we take a little white, a little brown, a little touch of blue into it here"
Bob Ross,"And well just do this, shwoo. Turn it into some nice dirt area. OK"
Bob Ross,"Now then, let us build a tree right here. Nice tree, there we go"
Bob Ross,"This is just our dark color that weve used before, blue and brown and a little sap green"
Bob Ross,"Maybe we need a little bush right in here somewhere, just to break it up. A little bush out here"
Bob Ross,Maybe well put a little bush right there. OK. Add in some little trunks. Like so
Bob Ross,And well put some little highlights on here. OK
Bob Ross,"brush splashing in water brush banging on metal And, there we are"
Bob Ross,Some little things happening on this bush. OK. And well have some little bushes over here
Bob Ross,"Maybe we have a little path that sort of, just comes through here. Just a little dark area"
Bob Ross,"Thatll bring it down to it. OK, lets see what we can do here"
Bob Ross,"Lets have a nice tree right here, heading on right up through here maybe"
Bob Ross,"Put his other side on, dont want a one-sided tree"
Bob Ross,"OK, they go down through here, just let him fall down wherever. Maybe a little one there"
Bob Ross,Give them a little highlight. OK
Bob Ross,"And well take our dark color, and well put some leaves on that little rascal. There"
Bob Ross,"And well just take, a little more color, and well highlight these"
Bob Ross,brush splashing in water brush banging on metal Maybe well put a nice bright little tree right here
Bob Ross,And a few little things down here
Bob Ross,This sort of gives it the indication that the land works down that way. OK
Bob Ross,Now I wanna put a few little sticks all throughout here. Like so
Bob Ross,Were just cutting through the paint here
Bob Ross,"OK, now well take a dark color and Ive used a thin oil here, and maybe well put a few little things that are just, sort of, playing around out like so"
Bob Ross,"Just here and there, wherever youd like em. This is your creation"
Bob Ross,"OK, and we need to have a old dead limb here and there"
Bob Ross,"OK maybe Ill just mix up a dark, dark green here, well just put a few little highlights on these trees to indicate little lights playing on those"
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"brush splashing in water OK I think well sign that one, and that one should be just about finished"
Bob Ross,There we are
Bob Ross,"I really hope you have enjoyed this painting, I hope yours is complete also, if not, hope youll be with us next time"
Bob Ross,"And until we meet again, happy painting, thank you very much. acoustic guitar music"
Bob Ross,"- Hello, glad to see you again today"
Bob Ross,"Thought today wed do a happy little picture, maybe with the sunshine in the winter and just see what we can develop from there"
Bob Ross,So lets start out here with just a little touch of permanent red mixed with a little bit of yellow
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put the sun in here, so were gonna start right in the center, where we want the sun to be, and thisll end up being the aura thats around the sun"
Bob Ross,And Ive already prepared the canvas with Magic White so its nice and wet
Bob Ross,"Now were just gonna start little X patterns here, and we want this to get darker and darker and darker as it works out"
Bob Ross,Here Im using a little bit of alizarin crimson and white
Bob Ross,"Work your brush back and forth, keep it moving"
Bob Ross,"Its much, much easier to blend these colors when theyre like this, and then drawing a big circle"
Bob Ross,"Now, well take a little bit of alizarin crimson with a touch of Prussian blue into it"
Bob Ross,"Make sort of a, like a lavender color. There we go. And just work it around"
Bob Ross,"light music Okay, see how that just comes right together"
Bob Ross,And lets put just a little touch of this pink running right down like so
Bob Ross,"Well just bring all this together. Maybe a little bit here, maybe have a little touch of water"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets go into a mixture of Van Dyke brown, Prussian blue and a little bit of white to give us a gray effect, and well work that, also starting from here and working downwards so that it gets lighter and lighter as it gets toward the sun"
Bob Ross,"Too many times in paintings, we try to avoid the sun. And the suns a beautiful thing to paint"
Bob Ross,"Its part of nature, you see it just about everyday"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes we dont see it everyday, but just about"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well take the almighty brush here and were gonna begin hypnotizing this, and do it in little X strokes back and forth"
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,And we just wanna blend this color out so its nice even distribution of color by the time were finished
Bob Ross,"Always working with a clean brush from the lightest area outward, okay"
Bob Ross,And its beginning to come together now
Bob Ross,"And while the brush is dirty, well go ahead and put in a little bit of water, and Im using the same gray that I used in the sky"
Bob Ross,And you dont wanna cover up this area if you want a nice paint reflection coming across the water
Bob Ross,"You wanna leave this area open. And well bring this across, gently hypnotize it"
Bob Ross,Well clean the almighty brush out here a little bit
Bob Ross,"Now you can work this as many times as you want, but the big thing is to always start with a clean brush and work outward"
Bob Ross,"Okay, there we go. See, just having nice gradual blending of color. We will hypnotize it a little"
Bob Ross,"Now well take a one inch brush, fill it full of titanium white"
Bob Ross,And were going straight into the canvas and were gonna push very hard
Bob Ross,Just push this value right into the canvas like so
Bob Ross,"And if you wanna give some little indications of sunlight, you can just gently put a few of these in"
Bob Ross,"Just here and there, okay. Now well take out all the excess loose paint"
Bob Ross,The value remains in the canvas. Now we can hypnotize that
Bob Ross,And we dont want these to be bright and distinct
Bob Ross,"Theyll still show, even though you hypnotize them over and over and over. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now if you got that done, we can move right along here"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit of the alizarin crimson, a little blue, mix it together here"
Bob Ross,And were just gonna make an indication of some nice little hills and mountains way back here in the background
Bob Ross,"There we go, just lay them on with a knife. Were using very, very little paint"
Bob Ross,Scrape off all the excess. And well just let it run right on out
Bob Ross,"Okay, with a big brush, well pull that down"
Bob Ross,"And with a large brush like this, you can make all of your highlights and shadows in the mountain just by using brush strokes"
Bob Ross,Were not gonna worry about highlighting this with white like we normally do
Bob Ross,We just want sort of a silhouette back here. Now well take a little bit of the grayish color
Bob Ross,Maybe just a touch more brown. And were gonna put in some little foothills that are way back here
Bob Ross,Just take the big brush and tap the canvas. There we go
Bob Ross,And well take a little bit of that same color and pull downward. This will make our reflections
Bob Ross,"And Im gonna lift slightly upward, just to give it the appearance of little trees way back in the distance, far, far away"
Bob Ross,"Okay. Okay, now, well just hypnotize this just a little bit to give it a watery effect"
Bob Ross,Now a little bit of Magic White. A little bit of Magic White
Bob Ross,And to it Im gonna add just a little bit of pink
Bob Ross,"Thats a little too much, so we will just tone it down. There we go, thats better"
Bob Ross,And well cut us a little water line back here. We dont want this to be bright and distinct
Bob Ross,We just want a gentle little water line to break up these two dark areas
Bob Ross,Act just like youre trying to cut right through the canvas. Go straight into the canvas
Bob Ross,"And alrighty, you have the impression of just a beautiful sun, little hills in the background, foothills in the foreground"
Bob Ross,Now lets come forward and see what we can make
Bob Ross,Think well take a little alizarin crimson and a touch of sap green mixed together
Bob Ross,Make a very warm brown color here. And we use the almighty fan brush
Bob Ross,And lets come down and lets just have some little grassy areas right along in here. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now when youre doing this at home, if you find that you end up with a bunch of smiley faces because the fan brush is curved, use the corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,Just use the corner. Dont end up with a picture full of smiley faces all at one time
Bob Ross,"Supposed to make you happy, but we dont wanna show all the smiley faces, okay"
Bob Ross,Now well take some titanium white. And begin laying in a little snow here
Bob Ross,And the angle that you lay this in is very important
Bob Ross,"We want this to show a little coming down, little gradual decline"
Bob Ross,So were gonna pull it in that direction
Bob Ross,"And let your paint break, so you have all these open spots, and the color we put here ends up being shadows"
Bob Ross,"Okay, then we can work the little grassy areas right into that"
Bob Ross,And you have those travel with the lay of the land also. Let them sort of flow down like that. Okay
Bob Ross,"Lets clean off a little spot to work here, and well make some almighty trees"
Bob Ross,"Wanna take some Van Dyke brown, Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,Little phthalo green and a little touch of alizarin crimson
Bob Ross,"You want a very dark color, it should look black"
Bob Ross,"And lets see here, were gonna load the brush full of paint and lets put a happy little tree, lets see, lets see"
Bob Ross,"Right here, and we sort of just touch the canvas to give us a guide, then were gonna push upward"
Bob Ross,Make a little different kind of tree today. Just push
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets give him a little friend right here. And we push"
Bob Ross,Just push those limbs right out of the brush
Bob Ross,"And maybe well put some nice little snow-covered bushes in here too, so well just lay those in"
Bob Ross,You need the dark in order to show the light
Bob Ross,Put your dark color in so the light will show up when we put it on
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well just cut through the paint to give some little trunk indications here and there"
Bob Ross,"Now we take a little bit of Magic White, and well mix that with firm white and a little touch of the blue that we used to make the tree"
Bob Ross,"And well highlight this tree, and we see our light source, so we just push"
Bob Ross,We want this side of the tree to be a little bit brighter. There we go. Little bit for over here
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets highlight some of these bushes"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little bit of Magic White with the firm white, little touch of permanent red just so it sets off a little bit better"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now well push off some nice little snow-covered bushes"
Bob Ross,"So very gentle touch, just enough to get the paint to come off the brush"
Bob Ross,"Heres a nice bush, well put some snow on him"
Bob Ross,"When youre doing this, try to do one bush at a time and have him finished before you go to another one"
Bob Ross,"Otherwise, theyll just sort of run together and youll lose track of them"
Bob Ross,"Okay, then well put a few little stems here and there"
Bob Ross,"All were doing is cutting right through the paint. Okay. Now, lets have some snow coming this way"
Bob Ross,Change these angles a little bit so that we have different planes in this picture
Bob Ross,And maybe well bring that down just a little more
Bob Ross,Well have a little angle coming right down like that there
Bob Ross,"Okay, seems like I remember there was a old farmer that used to live here and he built a barn right here, so lets put a nice barn here"
Bob Ross,And its better to sort of scrape it out to get all the loose paint off so the other paint will stick
Bob Ross,Its also a nice way to lay it out. Give you an idea of your perspective and what youre doing
Bob Ross,Just basic shape
Bob Ross,"Okay, so well take a little Van Dyke brown, and lets lay this eave here in like so, there"
Bob Ross,And well put some snow on the roof. Just come down and let it drop
Bob Ross,"We wanna give it the indication that its sort of, one of these roofs had come over and dropped"
Bob Ross,And Im gonna firm that back edge up
Bob Ross,"Over, down, over, down, these strokes are very important to make it look like the roof has that angle in it"
Bob Ross,"Okay. Gonna put some wood in here, just like so. There we go. Then some over here"
Bob Ross,Gotta have a side on the barn. Dont want the cows to get out
Bob Ross,"Okay, now, lets put a little bit of snow on the other side of the roof over here, and we can firm this up"
Bob Ross,And maybe a little bit right along through here
Bob Ross,"A little more Van Dyke brown, and we can lay some shadows in there. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, tell you what, lets give him a little shed out here"
Bob Ross,"Farmer always needs more room, so well put him a little shed. Little more of the brown"
Bob Ross,"See how easy that is, just let it happen. And we need a little place for him to put the hay up here"
Bob Ross,And you can create any kind of barn you want here
Bob Ross,"Its just a matter of working with a knife, letting it happen, and having something inside that you wanna put on canvas"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets put a nice bush here, pushing back into the bushes"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this old farmer, maybe he took up drinking a little bit too much, you know, we all have our problem sometimes"
Bob Ross,And the woods are sort of creeping up and fixing to eat up his barn
Bob Ross,"Okay, well take a little more of the titanium and the magic mixed together, and well put some highlights on these bushes"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Okay, and here and there, we have some more of the little weeds that are growing around"
Bob Ross,Just use the corner of the fan brush till you make friends with it
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres some growing right along the edge of this little hill, okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets put an almighty tree in here. Lets come right along in here"
Bob Ross,"Big tree, he just goes right on off the canvas. There we go, now were getting some size to it"
Bob Ross,"Okay, there we are. Now we can take him, put some highlights on him"
Bob Ross,"Little bit of the magic, a little titanium, and then were gonna put some blue in there"
Bob Ross,Want this to look cold
Bob Ross,This picture should have both warmth and coldness in it cause we have the sun with all the warm colors coming right through here
Bob Ross,So lets do this. Ill just put some nice little highlights here
Bob Ross,Just let the light bounce through there and play. Okay
Bob Ross,Now we can continue with our snow here a little more
Bob Ross,"And lets bring this one, have a different plane coming down through here"
Bob Ross,Just let it come right through. There we are. Okay
Bob Ross,Just let that knife right down the angle that you want to show that your land is flowing and try to let the paint break
Bob Ross,"Okay. Lets take, maybe we have a few more little bushes in here, that are growing down the hill"
Bob Ross,"Just push these in like so. Okay, a little more of the magic"
Bob Ross,"Remember, thin paint will stick to a thick paint, so you need to thin your paint just a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Okay, just a little touch more. And well put a nice little bush, its standing right here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe another one right along here, there we go"
Bob Ross,Just sort of let your imagination wander around
Bob Ross,"Wherever you think there might be a little bush or tree, put it in, this is your world"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe well take, put in some little trunks here of a little tree, that just about has nothing on it"
Bob Ross,Just the trunk left. Old Man Winters taken all of his leaves away
Bob Ross,"You know, in Alaska, we have in the winter, ice fog, which settles on every little branch, everything"
Bob Ross,"Oh, its so beautiful. It just looks so pretty. Its almost like something out of a fairy tale book"
Bob Ross,"Thats probably one of the reasons I paint so many winter pictures, cause in Alaska we see a lot of winter, so"
Bob Ross,Its a good way to learn how to use the equipment
Bob Ross,"And were trying to give you ideas here, trying to teach you a technique, and how to use it. There"
Bob Ross,Maybe another little thing coming up through here. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now maybe this old farmer, before he left the farm, maybe he had a fence that went right along here, had to keep the cow in"
Bob Ross,And make up these little stories as you paint. It really helps give you ideas
Bob Ross,"It makes your imagination work, and imagination is the key to painting"
Bob Ross,"What to paint is much, much harder than how to paint it, and weve showed you how to paint it"
Bob Ross,Now the imagination comes from you. And maybe we can see the top of one more little post right there
Bob Ross,"Okay, and well take a little bit of color, a little white, and well put a little highlight on these, just like so"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and a little snow laying on top"
Bob Ross,And lets have a wire running along these fence posts that just comes riding down like so
Bob Ross,And all weve done here is just literally scratched through the paint. Okay
Bob Ross,"And you know, they always have a few little bushes that grow around the posts"
Bob Ross,"When youre cutting the grass, you cant get up next to the post to cut it, so usually always have something around here"
Bob Ross,"And maybe theres just a touch of very, very light blue, very light"
Bob Ross,"We can just put some little indications of shadows back here, just a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets put some highlights on the little bushes. There we go. And look at there"
Bob Ross,Just make those sparkle in the sun
Bob Ross,"And here and there, a few more little weeds, sticking through the snow"
Bob Ross,"You can sort of fix it up none, but dont piddle it to death. Dont keep playing with it"
Bob Ross,One of the hardest things is when do I stop. Do I go a little bit farther
Bob Ross,"And you can sit and look at a picture long enough, and youre gonna find something else you wanna do, and youre gonna piddle it and piddle it, and soon, all youre gonna haves a heavy mess, so learn when to stop"
Bob Ross,Just a few little sticks here and there. And lets put just a little touch of highlight on this
Bob Ross,"Little happy sunlight shining through there, there we go"
Bob Ross,See what you can do in just a matter of a few minutes. And we knew you could do it
Bob Ross,"Okay, and when you do this at home, you have unlimited time and you can take and put a lot more detail into it"
Bob Ross,You can work out a lot of things
Bob Ross,"Here, were just trying to give you an idea in 30 minutes, so I think Ill just sign this"
Bob Ross,"We use a thin oil with a little bit of color on it, till we get it just about the consistency of water"
Bob Ross,"Very, very thin, and with that then, you can just take and write your name"
Bob Ross,Takes as long to write your name as it does to paint the picture nearly
Bob Ross,Maybe a little more paint right there
Bob Ross,"And I will advise that you date your painting so in years to come, as you look at them, or as your grandchildren look at them, you can tell what year this was painted in, and brings back a lot of happy memories"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now Im gonna take just a little more of the oil and put with a little bit of brown, and maybe well put a"
Bob Ross,"there, because this is a thin slick paint, it can go right over the other paint without messing it up"
Bob Ross,Adding a few little sticks here. There we go. And just moving right along
Bob Ross,"Okay, see I told you not to piddle it, and Im sitting here and Im starting to piddle it to death, so I think well just lay the brush down and call that one finished"
Bob Ross,"And we hope you enjoyed the almighty sun, the barn, the beautiful painting done today"
Bob Ross,"And you can do it too. Until we meet again, happy painting. light guitar music"
Bob Ross,"- Welcome back, hope you have your canvas set up on your almighty easel and youre ready to paint along with us"
Bob Ross,Thought today wed show you how to do snow
Bob Ross,"And weve had several requests, people asking us how do you put snow"
Bob Ross,How do you make it look like the snow is falling. So I thought thats what wed do today
Bob Ross,"So were gonna start out here with a little Van Dyke Brown and Prussian Blue, and well very quickly throw a little Sky in here"
Bob Ross,"And were looking for a sky thats sorta gray, overcast"
Bob Ross,"So well sorta test it and see how it looks, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Thats a nice gray color, sort of a blue gray"
Bob Ross,"Weve already got the canvas covered with the Magic White, so were actually blending color right here on the canvas"
Bob Ross,Were mixing a painting. Mixing a painting right on the canvas. Okay
Bob Ross,Maybe just a little bit more right here. Put some life in this sky
Bob Ross,"If its snowing, we have all kinda things going on. And well gently hypnotize a little bit"
Bob Ross,Dont want to kill all the little actions that weve created in here
Bob Ross,And well take a little more of the same color and lets just lay in a little bit of water
Bob Ross,There we go. And we might as well make some almighty mountains today too. What the heck
Bob Ross,"If you learn how to make mountains using this knife, the knife will probably never give you any more problems"
Bob Ross,Okay
Bob Ross,"brush thuds Okay, lets take some Titanium White and maybe well just lay in some nice clouds that are just laying around up here in the sky having fun"
Bob Ross,"Dropping snow on us, thats what theyre doing. There we go. Im using quite a bit of paint here"
Bob Ross,And you can put these at any angle you want em
Bob Ross,"Probably at this point, youre looking at that, and saying my God, hes got a mess going there today"
Bob Ross,But hopefully itll come out. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now well take the almighty brush, and were gonna start pulling this. Look at that. Instant clouds"
Bob Ross,"But you need a good firm paint to do this, otherwise its just gonna smear on ya"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe well take, put a little gray underneath some of these"
Bob Ross,"Take a little blue, brown and white. Okay, and just here and there, well lay a little touch of gray"
Bob Ross,"Just to give it sort of an overcast feeling. Okay, now lets work that in. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets build an almighty mountain"
Bob Ross,"Well take some blue and some brown, a little touch of Alizarin Crimson"
Bob Ross,And lets put us a nice mountain right up through here
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little peak like so, and well just let that run right on off"
Bob Ross,"Okay, with the big brush, well pull that down"
Bob Ross,"Okay, a little bit of Titanium White, and well lay some snow on here. Little bit back on this peak"
Bob Ross,There we go
Bob Ross,"Let this paint break, most important that it break and let some of these dark areas show through"
Bob Ross,"Maybe another little peak over here. Its your mountain, so you can do whatever you want to with it"
Bob Ross,"Let these peaks just occur. Okay, well take some blue and white, make us a shadow color"
Bob Ross,"There we go, and lets lay some shadows in here, very lightly, just want that paint to barely touch the canvas and to break as it comes floating down through here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well give this little peak his own shadow. And well lay a few little shadows here and there"
Bob Ross,"Oh, I see a little ridge right there, there he is. Okay, maybe well just swing that around a little"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets diffuse this real good, and all were doing is tapping, dont want to destroy it"
Bob Ross,There we go. Now maybe well put another range of mountains in here
Bob Ross,"Well use the same colors, but make em darker to give the impression that its closer to us"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets have one coming right up through here. And well let him come over, maybe like so"
Bob Ross,"And let him fall down. Okay, take off all the excess paint"
Bob Ross,"And heres whats nice, if you want to change a shape, change it. There"
Bob Ross,"I like that a little bit better. Okay, well pull that loose paint down. Put some snow on him"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go right over here and let this one come down, work its way down"
Bob Ross,Maybe well just bring these together. See how you can put mountains together
Bob Ross,"Unbelievable amount of power that you control, to be able to move mountains and to change them"
Bob Ross,"Okay, we need some highlight right here, and lets put some shadows in"
Bob Ross,"See, another decision you have to make, is this peak on this side or that side"
Bob Ross,"And if you want to push it back, all we have to do is come down through here, bring that shadow right through it, and automatically he goes into the background"
Bob Ross,"There. Okay. Okay, then well diffuse this one. This feels nice and soft"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets throw in a few little trees back in here, and well take a little brown and a little touch of blue, and some white"
Bob Ross,And we want this to be very soft
Bob Ross,"So were mixing a color thats almost the same color that weve used here, and sorta lay it up against here and taste it, test it, make sure it works"
Bob Ross,And well put a little tree right there
Bob Ross,"Look at that little rascal, just jumped right off your fan brush"
Bob Ross,"And well give him a little friend, there we go. And maybe over here, ones a little bit larger"
Bob Ross,Maybe he got a little more light when he was a baby. He grew a little taller. There we go
Bob Ross,"And well just take and pull up some little grassy areas running back, well just have it run right on down like that"
Bob Ross,"There. Okay, now lets put a little bit of snow underneath him. Using just a little bit of white"
Bob Ross,"Okay. And let that paint break, very gentle touch just enough to get it to come off the knife"
Bob Ross,"And well take a little bit of this color, and well begin deciding where this ends"
Bob Ross,So well just lay some little banks right there. Just like so
Bob Ross,"Then well catch ahold of just the bottom of that, pull us a little touch of reflection down into here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, I want this to look misty, so Im gonna tap back here. Just tap it and tap it and tap it"
Bob Ross,"Lift it a little bit, just to create the illusion of mist back in the distance"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets come a little bit further closer, well add a little more color, a little brown, a little blue"
Bob Ross,And maybe well put a tree here. Okay. And lets give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend
Bob Ross,"Okay. Now, well come just a little closer, so Im gonna darken the paint just a little bit more"
Bob Ross,"As you come closer, let these trees get darker and darker. Maybe theres one right here in the front"
Bob Ross,"Just a little one. Okay, little areas of grass in here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now, lets take a little bit of the Magic White, put us a little water line into here"
Bob Ross,And well just let this sorta work around the corner. Okay
Bob Ross,Little Magic White just to create the little water line here
Bob Ross,"And we got another little hill coming right down, there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well pull this one down just a little touch. Take the Magic White"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets do something on the other side here. And lets put a little tree right there"
Bob Ross,"Heres far away too. Okay. Okay, lets give him something to stand on out here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well have a little cliff, just sorta hanging around. There"
Bob Ross,Then we need a little bit of snow on top. Like so. Let that come all the way out there
Bob Ross,And maybe then we have a larger hill thats coming down. There we go. Pull a little bit of that down
Bob Ross,"Maybe over here, theres a place that just sorta breaks off, snow doesnt hang right there"
Bob Ross,"Just sorta, there we go. Okay. Put us some water lines around this"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little bit of white, mixed with a little Magic White here, just to make it a touch thinner"
Bob Ross,And just bring it right on around. There
Bob Ross,"Just some snow laying right along in here, up against that little cliff area"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and then we can bring this right on down. Make this like a little cove there"
Bob Ross,"Any way you want one of these little coves, really all you have to do is just sorta lay a shadow in"
Bob Ross,"We could put another one in here for example, if you wanted to"
Bob Ross,"And then bring it down, so it just comes right down to it. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,Now well put just a few more little trees right in here
Bob Ross,"These are getting closer, so theyre beginning to get quite a bit bigger"
Bob Ross,Just drop them in real quick. Need a lot of paint on your fan brush when youre doing this
Bob Ross,"Okay, some little grassy areas. And a little more paint on my brush"
Bob Ross,Lets do an almighty tree right here. Okay. This fan brush is a fantastic little piece of equipment
Bob Ross,"Practice with it, use it, make friends with it. Itll do things for you that you wouldnt believe"
Bob Ross,"But its like everything else, you really need to practice with it. It has to be a friend"
Bob Ross,"See, maybe you want to put another little tree right here. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Just decide where you want him, let him fall in"
Bob Ross,And well put some little grassy areas working their way down. This helps shield the lay of the land
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go back over here a second, and Ill throw a couple more little things right in there"
Bob Ross,Okay
Bob Ross,"Wash the brush, now lets take a little bit of the thin oil, mix it with some brown, just a little touch"
Bob Ross,"And we want this quite light, dont get it get too dark on ya"
Bob Ross,And well just put in a few little sticks that are showing here and there
Bob Ross,"And the father back they go, the smaller they should get. And the lighter in color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back in here somewhere, just some kind of little thing working around. There. Okay. There"
Bob Ross,And we can take the knife and cut a few little sticks in here and there. Just a few small ones
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe well go up here and sharpen that point a little touch"
Bob Ross,"Okay, let me wash out the fan brush here"
Bob Ross,And well show you how to make some happy little snow on this
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take some Magic White, and thin it even a little bit thinner, using some paint thinner, so its very, very thin now"
Bob Ross,Its almost the consistency of water
Bob Ross,"And if I may, Im gonna lay the palette down, so I can use both hands, and well just work off the palette laying right here"
Bob Ross,Now well take the fan brush is loaded with a lot of very loose paint
Bob Ross,"Were gonna take here and just flip this against, so it flips little globules of snow up here"
Bob Ross,Can you see whats happening. Thats all were doing is just flipping it right against the fan brush
Bob Ross,Isnt that something
Bob Ross,Used to spend weeks and week sitting around with a one haired brush trying to make all these little snow things fall
Bob Ross,And all you gotta do is just flip this brush. Bend the bristles and make it pop
Bob Ross,And we can create all the snow we want. Lets put a little bit more on here
Bob Ross,"There we go, look at all that snow. Got your heavy coat out yet. Its getting colder. Okay"
Bob Ross,Really suggest you do this in an area though where youre not gonna cover the whole house with snow
Bob Ross,Nothings gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow covered dinner
Bob Ross,"So, be careful where you do this. It does splatter and go all over the place"
Bob Ross,"And you can get carried away, and finally just cover up the whole picture with snow"
Bob Ross,"Nice, even distribution, there we go. Little bit more paint, I need some more right in here"
Bob Ross,And you can learn to control this very well
Bob Ross,"You can have it hit just about anywhere you want, you can make little bitty ones or bigger ones, according to what type of snowflakes youre trying to make"
Bob Ross,This old magic knife does a little bit of everything
Bob Ross,You just have to make friends with it and use it. Now Im getting into some real fine snow
Bob Ross,This is also a nice way to create a misty effect
Bob Ross,"You can keep working an area with very fine little globules of paint, and it makes a beautiful little misty area, if you ever wanna do that"
Bob Ross,"Once again, this is Magic White, thinned even thinner with a little bit of odorless paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go back up here and put just a little more in the sky"
Bob Ross,"Okay, I think thats enough to give you the idea of how to do it"
Bob Ross,water splashes Find my almighty palette again. Okay
Bob Ross,"Maybe, see one little area here Id like to tinker with a little bit"
Bob Ross,Id like to put a tree right here to sorta kill this area
Bob Ross,"I sorta left it open, so thats no problem"
Bob Ross,You just go back and put you one more little happy tree in
Bob Ross,And then youll have to put some snow over the top of him to make him fit in to the picture a little better
Bob Ross,Okay. And thats basically how we make snow
Bob Ross,So lets take and put a few more little sticks here and there. Just let them go
Bob Ross,"Just let that, that just sorta blends right into the mist and just sorta disappears into the background"
Bob Ross,"Okay. Now, maybe well put just a stick or two here. Just a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Oop, put a little tree here that just lost all his little leaves and stuff. Cold weathers got him"
Bob Ross,"This reminds me a great deal of my home, its quite often we see these areas where we can see the almighty mountains and all the mist"
Bob Ross,"Beautiful mist. There we go. And we can just take, put a little touch of highlight on that"
Bob Ross,Little snow laying here and there on the tree. Okay. I think were gonna call that one finished
Bob Ross,"I hope youve enjoyed it, and when youre trying this at home, once again, just take your Magic White, thin it down with paint thinner, and flip it on there using the fan brush and a knife"
Bob Ross,"Be careful where you do it, or youll have a happy house thats covered with snow from one end to the other"
Bob Ross,"And until we meet again, thank you very, very much for watching us. Happy painting"
Bob Ross,soft guitar music
Bob Ross,"- Hello, glad to see you again"
Bob Ross,"This being the last show of the series, we decided to devote it to a question and answer period"
Bob Ross,"Weve had so many cards and letters from everyone whos watching us, and today were gonna try to answer some of those questions, right here on the TV"
Bob Ross,"Also, today its a great, great privilege to me, to be able to introduce the pride and joy of my life"
Bob Ross,"This is my son, Steve, and Ive asked Steve to come give me a hand today, and hell read the questions for us"
Bob Ross,"Steve, glad to have you with us. Good to see you today"
Bob Ross,"Okay, I think everybody has probably asked just about the same basic questions, so weve picked a few letters here today that will answer most of the basic questions"
Bob Ross,"If we dont answer your specific question, we will be dropping you a line personally, if its something only few people asked"
Bob Ross,"So, Steve, why dont you give us the first question"
Bob Ross,"- Okay, the first question is, What is magic white.  - What is magic white"
Bob Ross,"Magic white is a very thin, white, oil based paint"
Bob Ross,And its very important to know that its an oil based paint
Bob Ross,"Please, do not get it confused with Gesso. Gesso is a water based paint, it will not work"
Bob Ross,Magic white is designed to stay wet on the canvas for extended periods of time
Bob Ross,"And, maybe well just, demonstrate here a little bit, how think it really is. And, lets see"
Bob Ross,"If I can take just a little bit here, and well just put it right up here on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"And its very, very thin. Its almost like water. Like so"
Bob Ross,And I hope that does give you an idea of what magic white is
Bob Ross,"The big thing is, do not confuse it with Gesso. There is a terrific difference between the two"
Bob Ross,"Whats our next one, Steve. - How do I tell if I have too much magic white on my canvas"
Bob Ross,- Its a common mistake made
Bob Ross,"Its very, very easy to put too much magic white, and probably, well lets just do it"
Bob Ross,"Let me get an almighty brush here, and lets put some magic white on the canvas, and well just sort of demonstrate"
Bob Ross,"bristling And, if youll put the magic white on, and really work it. Back and forth"
Bob Ross,It takes a very thin coat of magic white. Just enough to get the canvas wet. Okay. Just like so
Bob Ross,"If theres any doubt in your mind, and you think you may have too much magic white, I suggest you clean your brush, dry it very well, go back over the canvas and remove any excess magic white thats on your canvas"
Bob Ross,"bristling Okay, so you just rub this in. Very, very good here. And work it back and forth"
Bob Ross,There we go. bristling Nice even distribution of paint
Bob Ross,"Once again, if theres any doubt in your mind, clean your brush and go back over it"
Bob Ross,"It will pick up the excess. Okay, what do we have next"
Bob Ross,- Can I use any kind of oil paint for this method
Bob Ross,"- The biggest thing that were looking for is a paint that is very, very firm"
Bob Ross,It has to be as thick as you can possibly get it
Bob Ross,"What we suggest is you go down, open the tube of paint, squeeze it"
Bob Ross,"It should stand approximately three quarters of an inch above the tube, by itself"
Bob Ross,"If, when you open it and squeeze it, if the paints sort of oily, if it runs out the sides, it will not work"
Bob Ross,We suggest that you really try this. It has to be firm. Okay. Whats the next one
Bob Ross,"papers rustling - The brushes I purchased not seem to work, what do you suggest"
Bob Ross,- We run into this quite frequently
Bob Ross,"People will watch what were doing here on TV, and they go down to the local hardware store, and they purchase the cheapest brush they can find"
Bob Ross,"Most of the time, youll end up with a nylon brush"
Bob Ross,"The brushes that we use, let me just pick one up here. The brushes that we use are natural bristle"
Bob Ross,"These are split boar bristle brushes. So, when you purchase a brush, get one that is natural bristle"
Bob Ross,Do not let them sell you a nylon brush. It will not work. It cuts paint
Bob Ross,"Okay, whats our next question. - Can I clean my brushes in turpentine. - Turpentine"
Bob Ross,"Several things are wrong. Number one, it has a terrible odor that will drive you out of the house"
Bob Ross,Youll be painting all by yourself very soon
Bob Ross,"Probably the biggest thing that happens with turpentine, it leaves a residue in your brushes that can only be cleaned out with soap and water"
Bob Ross,"And if you use soap and water on natural bristle brushes, youre gonna find they get very fuzzy and begin to lose their shape"
Bob Ross,"We suggest that you clean only with odorless paint thinner, and do not use turpentine"
Bob Ross,"Okay, what do we have next. - Is it alright to use canvas boards to paint on"
Bob Ross,"- This is a question thats asked over and over, because canvas boards are much more reasonably priced than stretch canvas"
Bob Ross,The big problem with using canvas boards is that inside the canvas board is a thin layer of cardboard
Bob Ross,"The cardboard has a tendency to absorb your magic white, and your canvas will become dry before the picture is finished"
Bob Ross,"We really recommend that you use a canvas thats covered with an acrylic primer, double primed"
Bob Ross,"Two coats of acrylic. And we find that the stretch canvas is much, much better than the canvas board"
Bob Ross,"Also, the knife has a slight curve in the long edge"
Bob Ross,"It is not straight, the curve is designed in there so when you push the canvas, it forms to the knife"
Bob Ross,So we really recommend that you use stretch canvas. What do we have next
Bob Ross,"- The snow on the mountains is so beautiful, but Im having a hard time making the pain break"
Bob Ross,"Can you tell me what Im doing wrong. - Well, maybe well just demonstrate"
Bob Ross,And I think I can probably answer most of the problems youre having just by doing it
Bob Ross,"So, lets just mix up a little, oh a little blue-brown and, and little touch of alizarin, and white"
Bob Ross,And lets just build an almighty mountain
Bob Ross,"scraping I think, first of all, lets, so we have a little background here to play with, lets just put in a very quick little simple sky in some blue"
Bob Ross,"bristling Just so we have something for the mountains, to set here against, rather than just a white canvas"
Bob Ross,Well just throw on a little blue paint. bristling Okay
Bob Ross,Just enough to give us a nice little sky here. Several things are probably happening
Bob Ross,"And well try to cover each one individually here. So, lets make a basic mountain shape"
Bob Ross,And lets just say this is our mountain here
Bob Ross,"scraping Probably the first thing thats happening, is that youre leaving too much paint on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"We want to remove all the excess paint that we possibly can. And were pushing very, very hard"
Bob Ross,Its a matter of pushing the paint right into the fabric
Bob Ross,"scraping So, when youre doing this, get tough with it, get strong"
Bob Ross,This is a time to take out all your flustrations
Bob Ross,"Its much better than kicking the dog around the house, or taking it out on your spouse"
Bob Ross,This is the way you take out your flustrations
Bob Ross,"Now, Ive scraped all the paint off here that I can get"
Bob Ross,"Now, Im gonna take the big brush, and pull this down"
Bob Ross,"This will take even more paint off, and thin whats here"
Bob Ross,"So, theres, virtually nothing left on the canvas except just the color thats pushed in to the material"
Bob Ross,"bristling So, here we have a basic mountain shape"
Bob Ross,"If youre having problems with the snow breaking, the most common problem is that youre pushing too hard"
Bob Ross,"This is absolutely, the most delicate touch imaginable"
Bob Ross,"I remember when I was teaching Steve to paint, I used to tell him to pretend he was a whisper, floating across a mountain"
Bob Ross,"Its that light of a touch. So, you touch it, just let it grab, and just the weight of the knife"
Bob Ross,And you can make this snow just break and flow right down the mountain
Bob Ross,"But, you need to do this with, aw, pretend your hand, if youre not careful, is gonna float right away"
Bob Ross,Its that light of a touch. And then you can add all the snow that you want on here
Bob Ross,scraping And think about where the lights gonna strike. This is another problem that we run into
Bob Ross,"Think about your light, if its coming from here, where its gonna strike all the little protrusions that come up from the mountain"
Bob Ross,Just like so
Bob Ross,"scraping The shadows are just like the highlights, only were going in the opposite direction"
Bob Ross,"And, I think youve heard me say, over and over in the show, each highlight must have its own private shadow"
Bob Ross,Each one
Bob Ross,"So, if you wanna make a peak, stand out, give him his own private little highlight, or a shadow, Im sorry"
Bob Ross,"Okay, there we go"
Bob Ross,"light cheerful music Probably, the biggest problem, once again, is too much pressure"
Bob Ross,"Use a very, very delicate touch. And the diffusing is another area we run into a lot of problems"
Bob Ross,"And here, its a light touch. A very, very light touch"
Bob Ross,"Its so easy to destroy this, and especially if youre using a paint thats not super, super strong"
Bob Ross,"Firm. Youre gonna destroy all your work. So, use a firm paint, barely touch the canvas"
Bob Ross,Just enough to diffuse this
Bob Ross,"bristling And then, we lift in the direction and angle that the mountain is flowing"
Bob Ross,"We lift it upward, just to take out the little tap marks. And just let it blend, right into nothing"
Bob Ross,And you can just make that big ol mountain lay right around there. Mist
Bob Ross,"Okay, Steve, whats our next question"
Bob Ross,"- Steve Would you show us up close, how to make the trees and bushes"
Bob Ross,Im also having trouble making the highlights stick to the canvas. - Another very common problem
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets make some, Ill show you several different ways here to make some trees, and maybe we can get the camera to come in real close, when we start this, and you can actually see how the brush is bending"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little blue and brown, a little touch of alizarin here, little sap green"
Bob Ross,Well just mix all these together
Bob Ross,"Now, if we can bring the camera in very close, you can see how full of paint the brush is here"
Bob Ross,"Has a lot of paint in there. Okay. Lets make a big, leafy tree"
Bob Ross,"We go into the canvas, and we just bend the bristles, and you see whats happening"
Bob Ross,"Thousands and thousands of little leaves, just happen. And we can make this tree any size we want it"
Bob Ross,"Just, we just keep working and playing on it here, and it just grows, right off your brush"
Bob Ross,"Okay, gonna put another little one right here while we got paint on the brush"
Bob Ross,"Now, this is the way wed make a leafy tree, and one of the ways to make bushes, for example, is to use a big brush, go straight into the canvas, and bend upward"
Bob Ross,Just push upward. Thats all there is to it. All were doing is just bending the bristles
Bob Ross,"Make the bristles work for you, youre the master"
Bob Ross,"bristling Okay, look it there, already we have a tree, mountains, nice little bushes, son of a gun"
Bob Ross,"Okay, how to make an evergreen tree. Well take, mix up some dark paint, here"
Bob Ross,"And well just use the same colors blue, brown, a little of alizarin, sap green. Very, very dark"
Bob Ross,clearing throat And well take and fill a brush full of paint
Bob Ross,"Probably, the biggest single problem we have is not putting enough paint into the brush"
Bob Ross,It takes a lot of paint to stick these bristles together
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets just go right up here on the canvas, and lets make an evergreen tree. Lets just touch"
Bob Ross,"All were doing at first is just touching the canvas, just to sort of give us a guideline"
Bob Ross,"Then we take the corner of the brush, and we start working from the center out"
Bob Ross,"The center of the tree is normally always the thickest, because you have limbs on the back of the tree, you have the trunk in the center, and the limbs are on the front"
Bob Ross,"All of which stop light, and make the center of the tree look very, very thick"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and let me just finish this little tree up, here"
Bob Ross,"Another thing we work very hard to accomplish in doing this, as tree limbs get older, they have a tendency to hang more"
Bob Ross,"And, underneath the little needles and stuff begin, oh, they get tired"
Bob Ross,"Some of them begin dying, and you always have these little things underneath"
Bob Ross,"For lack of a better word, I call them hangy downs chuckles"
Bob Ross,"There may be a proper name for them, but we just call them hangy downs. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Lets do that again, just so you can see one more time"
Bob Ross,"And if we can get the camera in here, real close, lets do one right about here"
Bob Ross,"We touch, get us a little guideline, then we start right with the corner"
Bob Ross,"The first time, its just a little touch. Next time, a little bigger, and were just working outward"
Bob Ross,Always from the center out
Bob Ross,"And, nothing wrong with reloading your brush several times through there, so you have a lot of paint"
Bob Ross,"And were not drawing with the brush, were just touching it, and letting it come off"
Bob Ross,"Okay, so, lets uh, kind of some more little bushes right here"
Bob Ross,We also can use this one inch brush to make almighty trees
Bob Ross,"And, all youre doing is the same thing we did with the big one, you just push"
Bob Ross,"bristling Push, push, push"
Bob Ross,"And you can use him sideways, just like you did the big brush to make all these nice little grassy areas come down through here"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And lets go back to the big brush, and just fill this up, give you an idea here. Okay"
Bob Ross,The big brush covers a lot of space in a very short time. Use it to your advantage
Bob Ross,"Okay, I think the other part of the question was, they were having trouble making their highlights stick on the trees"
Bob Ross,"So, lets, lets put some highlights on these trees"
Bob Ross,"First of all, Im gonna take a little brown and white here, and make some trunks"
Bob Ross,Might as well show the trunks too
Bob Ross,"All were doing here is touching, and pulling sort of too the left"
Bob Ross,"And you can put as many of these little trunks in as you want. scraping Here, just like so"
Bob Ross,"And then just, every so often. And we can put little trunks growing everywhere. There they go"
Bob Ross,"And, over here, well do the same thing. Just touch, indications, you dont see the whole trunk"
Bob Ross,Cause were gonna have leaves in the front
Bob Ross,"Okay, now to put these highlights on, were gonna take and dip the brush into some magic white"
Bob Ross,And then pull it through color
Bob Ross,"And maybe well make some nice green highlights, Ill put a little touch of phthalo green in here"
Bob Ross,"And, all you do is, just push, just enough to bend the bristles"
Bob Ross,And just lay all those beautiful little leaves on there. Thousands and thousands of them
Bob Ross,"I used to spend weeks with my one haired brush, tryin to do this"
Bob Ross,It almost it made me angry the first time I saw Alexander on TV
Bob Ross,That he could do in a matter of minutes what took me days to do. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now, theres nothing wrong with going back into your magic white, and adding a little more"
Bob Ross,"So, maybe well just put some highlights on here, let you really see how the highlights are made"
Bob Ross,"And, if you wanna some little smaller bushes down here, youre still using the same technique, pushing with the brush"
Bob Ross,Just where ever you want them
Bob Ross,"You can also use this brush sideways, and make beautiful little highlights"
Bob Ross,"Just let them sort of wander around, where ever they wanna go"
Bob Ross,"You can spend a tremendous amount of time, worrying about where things should be"
Bob Ross,"In the period of time that you spend worrying about it, you could have completed an almighty painting"
Bob Ross,"For the evergreen trees, I bring the brush back to a nice sharp point, just like I did to make the trees"
Bob Ross,"And, I start right up here at the top, and just begin touching"
Bob Ross,Evergreen trees are normally darker than other trees anyway
Bob Ross,"So, you dont wanna kill all this beautiful dark color that youve got in here"
Bob Ross,"You start at the top, on any kind of tree, and work down"
Bob Ross,"By working down, your brush is automatically picking up the color thats underneath"
Bob Ross,"Automatically gets darker as it goes down, because in nature, the light will come through here, it will strike the top of the tree normally first"
Bob Ross,"That would be the brightest area. Also, as limbs get older, they lose a lot of their chlorophyll"
Bob Ross,They begin losing a lot of their beautiful green color
Bob Ross,"So, automatically this happens, you dont have to work at it. Let the brush work, let the paint work"
Bob Ross,"Well highlight this other little evergreen over here. Right here, okay"
Bob Ross,"Well just take a, just touch"
Bob Ross,"And according to what side your lights coming from, you want that side of the tree to be just a little bit brighter than the other one"
Bob Ross,"Okay, while Im over here, I think Ill, put some highlights on this other tree"
Bob Ross,Give you one more to look at
Bob Ross,"Okay, but back to the basic problem, if it doesnt stick, majority of times your paint is too thick"
Bob Ross,"So, add a little more magic white with it. And, well throw some little highlights on this one"
Bob Ross,"Okay, let me wash out the brush"
Bob Ross,"metal clanking And, well put just a couple more little highlights in here, then see what our next question is"
Bob Ross,There we go. Just let them fall in here. Wherever you want them
Bob Ross,"And another thing we do, is mix the color on the brush"
Bob Ross,"Youve probably heard me say that throughout this series, several times, but its very important"
Bob Ross,"Because, that way you get a variety of color, all on the same brush"
Bob Ross,"Okay, think thats enough playin. Steve, whats our next question. - I love the reflections you do"
Bob Ross,Would you go over the process you use to make them
Bob Ross,"- Hmm, thats one I shoulda had you ask a little earlier, but, dont think thats any problem"
Bob Ross,"Let me clean out my big brush here, and well just see what we can do"
Bob Ross,"metal clanking This is also a good example of how you can change a picture, right in the middle of a picture"
Bob Ross,"So, Steve wants some reflection, lets give him reflections"
Bob Ross,"Well just start right along in here, and start pulling this downward. Just maybe like so"
Bob Ross,All were doin is pulling the paint down
Bob Ross,"Okay, now, gently go across it, just enough to give it a watery effect. Dont destroy"
Bob Ross,"metal clanking Okay, now maybe you want to, make a little more distinct reflection"
Bob Ross,"So, lets put a nice little, bright yellow bush, right here, and lets reflect that bush right into the water"
Bob Ross,"And we can just reflect a lot of things, while we got it on the brush here. Okay"
Bob Ross,Maybe well put a nice little bush out here that we can reflect
Bob Ross,"All Ive done is turn the brush over, and Im putting the bushes right into the water"
Bob Ross,"metal clanking Okay, now maybe we can get a close up shot, right in here, and lets see what we can do"
Bob Ross,"We have the paint laid on the canvas, so now were gonna take and very lightly, you almost let a hair touch, its that light of a touch"
Bob Ross,"Gonna gently pull that down. You dont wanna destroy, you just wanna diffuse it"
Bob Ross,"Now, were gonna slightly, with a light, light touch, just come across it to give it a watery effect"
Bob Ross,Okay. Now we can do the same thing over here. Just like so
Bob Ross,And you see what it looks like at this point
Bob Ross,Dont worry about making it perfect with the first stroke
Bob Ross,"You have to pull down, and then very gently, come across. And its very easy to destroy this"
Bob Ross,"So, all you wanna do is just barely touch the canvas. Let a hair almost touch the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Another thing that we get a lot of questions about, is putting the water lines in"
Bob Ross,"So, we might as well put some in. Here, Im gonna use just straight magic white"
Bob Ross,Put a little bit on the knife
Bob Ross,"And, the one thing to remember here, if youre making still water, its always flat, always level"
Bob Ross,"So, every little line that you put in it, must be basically flat"
Bob Ross,"You can go anywhere you wanna go with it, but you have to keep em straight. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Good example here, it looks like this is traveling right on back"
Bob Ross,"Okay, put a little more magic white under that. And were just cutting into the canvas"
Bob Ross,scratching Looka there. And just let it go wherever you want it to go
Bob Ross,"Okay, now maybe over here on this side, well take a little bit of Van Dyke brown, and well just show how you can make it look like soil, dirt, rocks, whatever"
Bob Ross,And were just laying a little color on here. Straight Van Dyke brown
Bob Ross,"Okay, then well take a little blue, white, and brown, and just like we were making mountains again, let it break, let it break"
Bob Ross,Leave these open spots. So it gives the appearance of dirt or stones
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we can put a little waterline underneath here with the magic white"
Bob Ross,Youre still keeping these lines basically straight. Okay. scratching Okay
Bob Ross,And well just add a few sticks here and there
Bob Ross,And maybe you wanna show a little something happening here
Bob Ross,"You can just, pull that down a little, so its not just a straight line going across. Okay"
Bob Ross,Just to break it up a little bit. And well put some little sticks here and there
Bob Ross,"scraping And maybe well take just a touch more color and let it run down this dirt area here, so it looks like it all comes together"
Bob Ross,You dont wanna have a straight line right across there
Bob Ross,"So, well just break it up here and there with some little grass thats growing down on the, on the bank right here"
Bob Ross,Okay. We could throw a few more little sticks here and there
Bob Ross,"Sometimes you can scratch through the paint, let the white show through, and give yourself a very nice effect of little sticks, little trunks happening here in the bushes"
Bob Ross,"Or sometimes, you might wanna take a little bit of paint and lay in there. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"So, there we go. And let some of these sticks run down on the, on the bank too, on the soil area"
Bob Ross,"Its not unusual, very common in fact to have a lot of little twigs and sticks growing around the water"
Bob Ross,scratching Just let these little things happen
Bob Ross,It really produces a tremendous feeling of depth in a picture
Bob Ross,"Well, you know weve sat here and answered questions, and son of a gun if we hadnt finished a picture"
Bob Ross,"And, I think, with that Im gonna, sort of bring this to a close"
Bob Ross,I hope weve answered the majority of your questions that really bother you
Bob Ross,"If you still have problems, or if theres anything youd like to know about this method of painting, feel free to drop us a line, well be glad to, to answer any question that you have"
Bob Ross,As long as its not too personal. Well just about answer anything
Bob Ross,"And, on behalf of my son, Steve, the entire crew here, I would like to thank you, very, very much for being with us through this, thirteen part series"
Bob Ross,"And hopefully well see you again in the near future. And with that, Im gonna sign this picture"
Bob Ross,"And tell each and every one of you, thank you from the bottom of my heart, weve enjoyed being with you"
Bob Ross,Happy painting. lively orchestral music guitar music
