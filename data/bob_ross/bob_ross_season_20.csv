Bob Ross,"instrumental music - Hello, Im Bob Ross, and Id like to welcome you to the 20th Joy of Painting series"
Bob Ross,"Son of a gun, its hard for me to believe this is the 20th series, but it is, and Id like to thank you very much for inviting me back for another series of painting shows"
Bob Ross,"If this is your first time with us, let me extend a personal invitation for you to drag out your brushes and your paints and paint along with us each show. I think youll enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets start out today and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me. And I think well just do a happy little picture today"
Bob Ross,"So, let me tell you what Ive got done up here. We have our standard old 18 by 24 inch canvas, but you use whatever size you want"
Bob Ross,"And we have it covered with a little bit of liquid white, just a thin, even coat, just enough to make the canvas wet. And with that, well just take off, and well have a super time"
Bob Ross,"Start today, I think well use a little one-inch brush and well go into a very, very small amount of the phthalo blue. Just a little bit. Dont want much"
Bob Ross,"And lets make some, lets make some happy little clouds in our world. Lets come right up here. And, well just take this brush, and well just bounce in some nice shapes"
Bob Ross,"Now, when were doing this, were interested in the white area, not the dark. So dont worry about the dark area. Were gonna blend that all out"
Bob Ross,"All were doing is putting in some color for the shadows of our clouds. And this is one of the nicest, easiest ways of making very effective, great big ol clouds. There"
Bob Ross,"See, were interested in this white area, once again. Maybe theres another little cloud that lives in our world, right along there"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you think they should be, then thats exactly where they should be. Just wherever. And just use the old little one-inch brush, and just, Im making tiny little circles"
Bob Ross,"Just tiny little circles. There we are. Okay, maybe Ill add a little color right in here too. Just so therell be a little color at the base of this cloud. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take our little brush, this is a two-inch brush, and go right up in here, and very gently, Im using just the corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,"Well make little, round circle patterns here, just sort of wind it up, blend it together. Allow it to blend with the white thats already on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"And thats the joy of this wet-on-wet painting technique. The fact that its wet allows you to blend color, right on the canvas. Right on the canvas. There you go"
Bob Ross,"Now, its beginning to make a little sense. See how those dark areas end up being the nice shadows and the white areas will end up being our clouds"
Bob Ross,"This is a great way to make clouds for seascape paintings. Just great, big, fluffy clouds. Works very nice. There we are. Now then, while we have this old brush dirty, tell you what lets do"
Bob Ross,"Lets go back into a little bit more of that phthalo blue. Phthalo blue is a very nice color, its a very warm blue. I like that. Just a little color on the brush. Okay, lets go back up here"
Bob Ross,"Lets have some water in this painting. If youve painted with me before, you know Im a fanatic for water. I love water. And its one of the nicest, easiest things to paint in this technique"
Bob Ross,"And today, maybe this one will be still water. So we want these lines to be basically straight across here. Cause as you know, still water is always flat, always level. There"
Bob Ross,"Now, just very lightly, go all the way across, and sort of bring it together. and that light area here, itll remain in there. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now, the most fun part of this whole technique is washing the brush. So lets do that. We wash our brushes with odorless thinner. Shake off the excess. laughs And just beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,This is where you take our all your frustrations and hostilities and just have a good time. Lets go into a little titanium white. Well use the old fan brush. Well make some little clouds
Bob Ross,"Ill be right back, let me grab the least little touch of the bright red. Just enough, a little bit more. There. Just enough to put a little pinkish glow into our little clouds"
Bob Ross,"Dont want much, dont want much. Okay, lets go up here. Now we gotta make big decisions. Well just use this brush and decide where our little clouds live"
Bob Ross,"And, we just come along here and sort of drop em in. This also works very well with a little one-inch brush. Very well. Either way that you wanna do it. Either way"
Bob Ross,"If you havent painted with us before, one of the things that we try to do here, we try not to teach you just to copy. All were trying to do is teach you a technique and turn you loose on the world"
Bob Ross,"We use no patterns, no tracings. All we do is sort of have an idea in our mind, and we just sorta let it happen"
Bob Ross,"And if youll practice this a little bit, very soon you can enjoy the freedom of creating a painting right on the canvas. Right on the canvas. And to me, thats where it really becomes fun"
Bob Ross,"Its when you can literally create a painting right on the canvas as youre working on it. You look at what youre doing, and youll see things. Theyll just sort of happen"
Bob Ross,And you learn to take advantage of whatever happens and use it to make your painting special. And you can do that
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go back, bangs brush on easel get our old two-inch brush, and I just wanna now blend all that together. Just blend together. Im being careful not to touch these top edges yet"
Bob Ross,"Im just blending the blue and the white down here together, very gently, still using little circular strokes. There we go. Just sort of let that mix together"
Bob Ross,"Im getting very close to the top, but Im trying not to touch it at this point. Very close, but not touching. There. A little bit up in here. See. Just sorta blend it together"
Bob Ross,"Mix it up, just like youre making a cake or something. Just mix it up. A little bit in here, right there. Okay. Good. But this is a beautiful way"
Bob Ross,"bangs brush I just beat the brush like that to knock off excess paint. Its a beautiful way to create a very effective, big, fluffy clouds. Now were just sorta lifting it up"
Bob Ross,"This will blend it all together, smooth it out. There. See there. And then, very lightly, two hairs and some air, just gently, gently, gently blend the entire sky"
Bob Ross,"And with that, shoot, we have a pretty nice looking little sky. And there wasnt anything to it. Now then, lets get crazy. Lets take, well use some midnight black, little Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,"Now, Prussian blue is much darker than phthalo blue, its strong, whew. Very strong color. Well put some Van Dyke brown, a little Alizarin crimson in there too"
Bob Ross,"But were looking for a very dark color, it should look black. Pull it out as flat as you can get it, and go straight down with the knife, and well just cut off a little roll of paint. There it is"
Bob Ross,"Its right out at the edge of the knife. Lets go up here. Now, I want to make some tiny little mountains up in here, that are far away"
Bob Ross,"I dont want these to be very big, because we wanna create the illusion of distance here. Using a very firm pressure, just literally push this right into the fabric"
Bob Ross,"And I dont want a lot of mountains today, thats about all we need. With a two-inch brush, Im gonna grab this and pull it. Just pull it"
Bob Ross,"It does two things, removes excess paint and it blends all this together. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now, when were painting mountains, as you know, you always want the top of the mountain to be more distinct than the bottom of the mountain"
Bob Ross,"Because at the bottom, we have mist and now we have wonderful pollution, and we have all these things that break up and diffuse light, and it creates this softness at the base of the mountain"
Bob Ross,"Lets go into a little titanium white, what the heck. Very small amount. Get a very, very small amount of paint on the knife. Now then, barely touch, no pressure. No pressure"
Bob Ross,"And I dont want this to be very distinct. I want this to be very quiet, subdued, far away, gentle, soft"
Bob Ross,"Think about those types of words and stuff when youre painting, and itll help your hand go much more gentle. But very soft. Dont want a lot of detail in this"
Bob Ross,"And well take a little bit of blue and white, and just the indication of some shadows, dont even want a lot of shadow back here. Too much detail will ruin that illusion of distance"
Bob Ross,"Just enough, just enough to give the feeling that theres a nice mountain living back in there"
Bob Ross,"Now with a clean, dry brush, following the angles, always follow the angles, were gonna very gently, very gently tap it and then lift it upward"
Bob Ross,"And thatll help also create that illusion of mist at the base of the mountain. Shoot, lets get crazy. Find another one-inch brush. Or you could use your fan brush, whatever"
Bob Ross,"Take a little bit more of the titanium white. Maybe in our world, maybe this old cloud right here, it just sort of drift right down in front of the mountain. So, just a little white"
Bob Ross,"Little circles, tiny little circles. Shoot, maybe theres one right here. I dont know. I dont know, just sorta look at your painting and make a decision"
Bob Ross,"Maybe it just sorta wraps this old mountain up. Well take a two-inch brush and just blend it together. This is a super way of making mountains, that look like their just laying out here in the mist"
Bob Ross,"I lived in Alaska for many, many years, and you see some of the most beautiful scenery there. God was having a good day when He made Alaska. Beautiful. Beautiful"
Bob Ross,"There, see that old mountain just lays up here in the mist now, and floats around, has a good time all day. Now then. Maybe well have some little foothills back here. I like to do little foothills"
Bob Ross,"And well take some of that same mountain color, add the least little touch of sap green to it. Little sap green, there we are. But its predominantly blue"
Bob Ross,"The one thats farthest away here, well make predominantly blue. Okay, let me wipe my knife off. And lets use, well use a one-inch brush, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"You could use your fan brush or two-inch brush, it doesnt matter. Load a little color in there. And lets go right up in here. Now, we have to make a big decision"
Bob Ross,"Where does our little foothills live. Maybe well have one coming right over here. Well start this one out back here, just using the corner of the brush and pulling straight down, gently"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little foothill comes right over like that. Wherever. Once again, this is a very individual thing, painting is. So, just sorta look at it and make up your mind how you want your painting to be"
Bob Ross,"Now then, when youre doing the foothills, especially layers of foothills, you want a little misty area in between, thats your separator"
Bob Ross,"So take the brush, two-inch brush, and just tap the base of it. And you can tap quite firmly. You can probably hear how hard Im hitting the canvas here"
Bob Ross,"And then, very lightly, just lift it upward a little bit. There. Okay, now then, maybe well have several layers in here"
Bob Ross,"When youre doing landscapes, each layer, each plane, as it comes closer to you, should get darker in value. So well use that same color, and Ill just add a little bit of that mountain color"
Bob Ross,"See, its right here, Ill just add a little of that into it. Thatll make it a little darker. Maybe a touch more of the green. There we go. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now, maybe over here, well hold the brush up like this. And thatll make tops that are a little taller, a little more distinct, cause theyre getting a little closer to you. There"
Bob Ross,But you can create just layer after layer after layer like this. And it enhances your painting tremendously because it creates that illusion of depth
Bob Ross,"Back to our two-inch brush, and once again, once again, we wanna create that mist. See how that mist in between separates. Its your best friend. Take care of it. Take care of it. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now lift upward. And maybe, Ill tell you what, lets have one more. Lets have one more. Im adding a little more of that dark color right into that same original pile. One more"
Bob Ross,"And then, maybe it lives right here. But its darker in value. Its a little darker. There we go. And well let him come, maybe, right down in here. I dont know. There"
Bob Ross,"But each layer, each layer needs to get darker in value. To keep that feeling of distance in the painting. And I know I repeat that over and over, but its so important. So important"
Bob Ross,"You dont want just a flat old painting. Shoot. We want a masterpiece here. And you can do that. Once again, were gonna tap that base, just like so. Very lightly, lift it upward. There"
Bob Ross,"And maybe, were beginning to get down here to where there are a few reflections, so well take a little paint on the two-inch brush, grab it and pull it straight down"
Bob Ross,"Its most important that these reflections come straight down. Most important. If you go at an angle like this, it wont look right. See, even there, it doesnt look right. Now very lightly, go across"
Bob Ross,"Very, very lightly. Just enough to blend it and give it the feeling of water. Its one of the nicest things about this technique, its instant reflections"
Bob Ross,"chuckles Now then, well take a little of the liquid white, put the least little touch of the bright red in it. Just, least little touch. Just enough to flavor it a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Be careful, because very quickly, this can get really intense in color. Now we just cut across. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Go up here, and well just put in, just the indication of a happy little waterline that lives here. Now, if you get one thats maybe a little too strong or too bright, just go back and rub it"
Bob Ross,"The more you rub it, the lighter itll get, because itll just be absorbed right into the color thats underneath. No big deal"
Bob Ross,"And if youve painted with me before, you know without question that we dont make mistakes here. We just have happy accidents. But you learn to use anything that happens. Okay, maybe, right there"
Bob Ross,"And, little ripples. But notice how all these lines are basically straight"
Bob Ross,"If theyre not, its gonna look like your waters gonna run right outta your painting and get your floor wet, and youll have to tie a bucket on one side"
Bob Ross,"chuckles We dont want you to have to do that. Now, tell you what. Clean off a little spot"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some black, Prussian blue, brown, crimson, sap green, all those same colors, but with no white in it. So very, very dark. Very dark. Looks black on the palette. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, let me clean my knife. And I just wipe the knife on an old paper towel. Find a fan brush here. Lets take the fan brush, and go right into that color. Load a lot of paint onto the brush"
Bob Ross,"Both sides. See, the bristles are, theres a lot of paint in there. Okay, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back in here, in our world, there lives, well there does now, anyway, there lives a happy little evergreen tree. And we just use the corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,"Just the corner, and as you work down the tree, add more and more pressure so that the bristles bend downward much, much more. Look at there. Isnt that a nice way to make a happy little evergreen"
Bob Ross,"Lets give him a friend. You know me. I think everybody, everybody should have a friend. Friends are so important. There. Alright. Maybe, shoot. In our world, maybe theres three trees here"
Bob Ross,You can put as many or as few as you want. The only thing that we would like to teach you here is how to make a tree. You decide how many trees you have in your world
Bob Ross,"Maybe well have some, maybe theres a little reflection down here. Just put some general shapes, were not looking for detail. Not looking for detail. Just very basic little shapes. Shoot, who knows"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres some land there too. You can just push up with the fan brush, a little bit down for the reflection"
Bob Ross,"And lets take, well use the old two-inch brush, and grab this, decide where water and land meet, and pull straight down once again. Straight down. Son of a gun. Instant reflections"
Bob Ross,"Go across, and that easy. That easy. And see, these reflections, you can push em. See how you can push em. Because the canvas is wet, you can do that. You can do anything here"
Bob Ross,"Oh this canvas, you have total and absolute power. Unlimited power here. laughs When I go home, the only thing I can do is take the garbage out. But here, I can do anything that I wanna do"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little of the dark sienna and a little white, get a little roll of paint on the knife, and lets put a little indication here and there of a little tree trunk that lives in these. There"
Bob Ross,"Dont want a great deal. Dont want a great deal, just enough to Just enough to indicate theres something in there"
Bob Ross,"And you can just take the point of the knife, and just scrape through and make little lines and sticks and all those little things. Tell you what, let me grab another fan brush"
Bob Ross,"And lets take and go into a little yellow, this is cad yellow, a little touch of that color we made the tree out of, since it has blue in it, as soon as we touch the yellow, turns beautiful green"
Bob Ross,"color. Maybe a little yellow ochre too. I want a dark green here. Once again, load the bristles quite full. A lot of color. Lets go up here. Now then, lets put some highlights on these little trees"
Bob Ross,"Dont wanna overdo. If you put too much highlights on here, too many highlights, then it loses its effectiveness. We want these to be quite dark. Look at there. And thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Darker, darker, darker. Now, maybe down here, theres some little grassy things that grow on this. And you can just make those by pushing up with the brush, thats all. Very easy. Now"
Bob Ross,"Lets have some land under there. We need something to hold those trees up so they dont fall over in the water and make a big splash. There. Little Van Dyke brown, little dark sienna mixed together"
Bob Ross,"Like so, well take a little touch of that brown and white. Just make the indication of a little land there. Little bit of the liquid white that we had left over"
Bob Ross,"And well just put in a little waterline. This waterline is your separator. Its a light between two darks, and that separates it, and makes it, makes it stand out. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, well just use this big brush. Ready to have some fun. If youve painted with me before, you know that I love to make big trees. So lets do that. Ill use the old two-inch brush today"
Bob Ross,"The old two-inch brush. So often we avoid this brush because its big and were afraid of it. A lot of paint. Wiggle. Wiggle, wiggle, then sharpen it, just like you would a knife"
Bob Ross,"Look how sharp this brush is. There, you can see. Its very sharp. Lets go up here. Now then, maybe in our world lives a big evergreen tree. Right there. Just touch the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Now, we use just the corner. Just the corner of the brush. And just go back and forth, and begin laying in all of these beautiful little limbs and stuff that live here on this tree. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, well have another one. You knew that, didnt you. You knew Id have a friend out here. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets have some, maybe theres some big, leafy trees, not evergreens that live here. There. Lets just push in some, push in some nice leaf and branch shapes. Look at there"
Bob Ross,"And when you use a big brush, you can do this very rapidly. Now, lets go on the other side. We need some over here too. Now, you can do this with a one-inch brush if you wanted to. Works just as well"
Bob Ross,"Just as well. This is just a little bit faster. A little bit faster. There we are. Okay. Just bring it right on down, right on down. Now you have to start making big decisions"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well just put it there. A nice bush lives there. Tell you what, lets get crazy. Maybe. Maybe it just goes all the way across. In your world, you can do anything that you want"
Bob Ross,"If you want this shrubbery and bushes and trees to come all the way across, then do it. Do it. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can just take a clean knife, and just make the indication of little sticks and twigs, just by scraping, just the point of the knife"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna cover most of those up, but some of em will show. We can even use a little brown and white, come right up in here, put the indication of a trunk. Not a great deal of detail, just a little"
Bob Ross,"Little over here. Cause these are gonna be deep in the old tree here, youre not gonna see much of them. But theyre there. Now then, lets take, well dip the brush into a little of the liquid white"
Bob Ross,"One-inch brush. Well go right through, Ill use a little cad yellow, grab some sap green up here. There we are. Cad yellow, sap green, pull the brush in one direction, load a lot of color in it"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go up here. Now then, think about all your little leaves and stuff here that would just shine and, oh, they would sparkle out here in the sun under this big mountain"
Bob Ross,"And when youre painting, make up little stories. Think about the scene that youre painting, become part of it. Make friends with a tree. Shoot, you can just drop all this stuff in. And let it go"
Bob Ross,"Darker, darker, darker as you work down toward the base of the tree, though, darker, darker. Add a little yellow ochre here or there, a little Indian yellow sometimes, just just to change the flavor"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you want em. There we are. Little touch of bright red even, here and there. Its up to you. Up to you. There. And you choose even the time of year. Lets go on this other big tree over here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe over here, there lives, there lives this big tree. Think about individual shapes and form inside of this tree. Dont just throw it on at random"
Bob Ross,"Think about, think about the limbs inside the tree that give it shape and form. There. Okay. Darker, darker, darker, down here toward the base. Much darker"
Bob Ross,"Lets have a bush right here that has red flowers on it. Look at that. See there. Just by putting a little bit of red on the end of the brush, you can do that. Here lives another one"
Bob Ross,"Just do one bush at a time, though. One at a time. There they go. Okay. Just wherever you want em. Shoot. Its coming along pretty nice. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"And the other side, over here, well put in some little bushes here. And you can use the brush sidewards. Just push upward and create all kinds of little things. Just like so. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put a little path in here, use a little Van Dyke brown, we got just a second left, so Ill throw that in. A little brown and white. Give this indication of a little path"
Bob Ross,"Then all we need to do is put a little bush over the top of it, and it sets it right down into the painting. Shoot, I think we have a finished painting"
Bob Ross,"With that, Im gonna wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend, Ill see you next show. instrumental music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Im glad you could join me today. Today I have one of my little friends here thats having lunch while were doing this, so I thought Id share her with you"
Bob Ross,"This is a little baby fox squirrel, and shes just having a little lunch with me. Oo, whats there. Too much. Huh. There. Isnt she somethin. Shes only a few weeks old, and just as cute as a button"
Bob Ross,"Thought Id show her to you today. There. Alrighty, enough of that. This is just one of my many friends. Im gonna set her down, and well get started here. Okay, if I can get her off my shirt. There"
Bob Ross,"They have about 9,000 claws and they can all seem to grab you at once. Alrighty, tell you what. Come on up to the canvas, let show you what Ive got done today"
Bob Ross,"Today we have our standard ol 18x24 canvas, or any size that you want, and Ive done something a little bit different today"
Bob Ross,"Ive taken in this area up here, the white area, this is a mixture of liquid clear and liquid white. I put the clear in there because I want some transparence today"
Bob Ross,"Then the rest of it Ive just covered with a little bit of liquid black, and just sort of swirled it around a little bit. Just sort of let em blend together"
Bob Ross,"So, we have liquid white and liquid clear mixture, and liquid black, and just blended together. Lets just have some fun today. I thought wed just do a happy little painting"
Bob Ross,"If you dont have all three of these mediums, you can do this with liquid white, but you wont have the transparence and the bottom will be a little bit more difficult. But you could do it"
Bob Ross,"Lets go into a tiny, tiny little bit of the Yellow Ochre. Maybe add a little Cad Yellow into it. Just mix them up together, here. like so"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna run all the colors across the screen so youll know exactly what were using here. There. Alright, lets go up in here. Lets make a big decision"
Bob Ross,"Now then, not even gonna clean the brush, but Im gonna go right into a small amount of Alizarin Crimson, and the crimson is strong enough that you dont have to clean the brush, itll go right over"
Bob Ross,"it. There, now then. Lets just go right around the edges here, like so. Just add a little touch of that crimson. There"
Bob Ross,"And let it blend outward, we dont wanna go back into this bright color, we wanna save that. Just let this blend right on out. There we go"
Bob Ross,"chuckles Alright, we have a masterpiece for the Museum of Modern Art, right there. Right there"
Bob Ross,"Now then, take a little bit of the crimson and Dark Sienna, still using the same brush, havent washed it yet. Mostly, though, Dark Sienna"
Bob Ross,"Then Im gonna come right around these, this area, and just begin blending it out"
Bob Ross,"Now, thisll begin mixing with the liquid black, and itll get darker and darker and darker out here, and thats exactly what were looking for. There. Now then, over here, a little bit more"
Bob Ross,This is just mainly Dark Sienna with a little bit of Alizarin Crimson. There we go. Hope you like the little squirrel. Im so crazy about these little devils that I like to share them with you
Bob Ross,"They are absolutely precious. We have four of them here in the studio today. They came from Diana Schaffer, the bird lady here in Muncie"
Bob Ross,"She takes care of these little fellers when theyve been orphaned, and I think shes doing a fantastic thing. There. Alright, now then. Lets wash the ol brush. Thats the fun part of this"
Bob Ross,"Lets just scrub it. Theres a screen down here in the bottom of the can that I scrub the bristles against to remove the paint, we shake off excess, chuckles and just beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,"Now then, with a nice clean and dry brush, be sure its dry, though, it needs to be dry, we want to start blending this. Just blending"
Bob Ross,You wanna blend it til you cant tell where one color stops and the next color starts. There we go
Bob Ross,"Sometimes when youre doing these little paintings, you like to make this area in here brighter, shinier. There. So, I tell you what. I have several brushes going"
Bob Ross,"Let me just grab another clean one, here. Well take a little bit of Titanium White, right on the ol two-inch brush. Just tap a little in there"
Bob Ross,"Lets go back up here, and right in here well start with the white, and just begin blending, and blending and blending and blending. Start from the light area, and blend outward"
Bob Ross,"Now, thisll really brighten this area. Itll just make it shine. You can do this as many times as you want to achieve a desired lightness or brightness. There, very lightly, just go across"
Bob Ross,"When youre doing this, sometimes step back and take a looksy at your painting. Its very difficult when youre standing real close to it to tell if you have it blended enough"
Bob Ross,You want it to be very soft. You dont wanna see distinct lines in here. Alright. A few strokes and were in business
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, while we have that ol brush going, chuckles lets just have some fun. Well go right into this Dark Sienna. Im just gonna tap the top bristles"
Bob Ross,Just tap it right into a little touch of that Dark Sienna
Bob Ross,Lets go back up here and with this lets begin putting in the indication here and there and there and here of some little shapes for little bushes and trees that live way back in the distance
Bob Ross,"Now, were not looking for detail. Well put detail in the foreground. Back here, we just want the indication of little things happening. Let your imagination go. Just let it go"
Bob Ross,"Up in here, we cant hardly even see em. Just let it go. There. As I mentioned earlier, the only reason we put that liquid clear in the background is to make this a little more transparent"
Bob Ross,"Just a little more transparent. There. Ive added a touch of Van Dyke Brown to the color now. As it gets further away, we want it to get a little bit darker, but not much"
Bob Ross,Just enough so it stands out a little bit. Maybe well have some nice tree shapes that lift all the way up to the top of the canvas over here. That easy. That easy. Alright
Bob Ross,"Lets take our little liner brush, shoot. Little paint thinner. Im gonna get a little more of the thinner. Well go right into that same Dark Sienna. A lot of paint thinner, though"
Bob Ross,"This should be as thin as water or ink, should just literally run. See how it just drips. Very very thin, okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, here and there, Im just going to put the indication of a little trunk or a stem or whatever. Some little tree shapes here and there, just to break it up. There. Maybe a few up in here"
Bob Ross,"Not lookin for a lot. When things are far, far away, you dont wanna be able to see a lot of detail. There we go. Alright, now then"
Bob Ross,"Wash the ol brush, and the liner brush, all I do is just wipe it on a paper towel after I washed it. Lets use our little oval brush today, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"Its easy to tell the little oval brush, It has a black handle on it. Alright, well take a little yellow. Be right back, dont go away. Get a touch of the Sap Green, here"
Bob Ross,"Kay, now, to load this brush, give it a little push. Just give it a little push. Get a little touch of the Yellow Ochre. I dont want a lot of color, just enough to sparkle"
Bob Ross,"A little of that Indian Yellow here and there, too. Just go up here. Now then, all you gotta do with this little brush is just tap"
Bob Ross,"Just tap, and we can begin making the indication of little distant trees and bushes that live way back here. Lighter, lighter, lighter as it comes down"
Bob Ross,"A little bit of the Bright Red here in there, too. Tiniest little bit. Decide where you want these little things. Maybe this little tree lives right here. Wherever. There we go. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now then, a little bit more. Tell you what, right in here, that looks like a good spot"
Bob Ross,"When youre doing this, just sort of look around and decide where you think a little tree would be happy living, and thats where he should be. Thats where he should be"
Bob Ross,"Im still just using the same colors, just varying them back and forth"
Bob Ross,"Have a little touch of the Sap Green, a little Cad Yellow, Yellow Ochre, a little touch of Indian Yellow, even, here and there, and once in a while, the least little touch of Bright Red"
Bob Ross,"Dont want much though, its so strong. The farther away it gets here, the less detail that I want. I want to get dark and darker back in here"
Bob Ross,Maybe even up in here theres some little things going on. There. These are hiding way back in the shadows. This is where all the little creatures live. Little bunny rabbits live back here
Bob Ross,"There we are. Okay. Shoot, thats about all we need for a little background on that side. Now then, were gonna put something over here"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets keep a lot of this in the brown tones today. Thats so pretty. Nice earth tones. Well use some Dark Sienna, a little Van Dyke Brown, pick up a little Yellow Ochre"
Bob Ross,"A little Yellow Ochre. There. Maybe even the least little touch of black in there. Oh, thats nice. Lemme wipe my knife off. Wipe the ol knife off. Well find us a fan brush. There we go"
Bob Ross,"There we go, just load it full of color. Both sides, just back and forth. Alright, lets go up in here. Maybe theres a little patch of evergreen trees, and they live right there"
Bob Ross,"Just start with a little line. Use the corner of the brush, just the corner. As you work down, apply more and more pressure. More and more pressure. There we are. Let em go. Like so"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets give him a little friend. There he is, there he is. Okay, and just decide how many trees you think should live in your world"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes I like to do little evergreen trees where you can see parts of the trunk, so maybe you can just tap in the whole trunk, cause trees dont grow all perfect"
Bob Ross,"Theyre like people, some of em are big, some are small. Some are skinny, some are a little heavier. There. See. Maybe another one like this right here beside him. Something like that"
Bob Ross,"I like to make these little clumps of trees because a lot of times you see evergreens in nature, it looks like they all got together and started a little community or somethin, having a party or"
Bob Ross,"somethin. I dont know, having a good time, though. There. Okay. That ought to be enough for our little area, but if you want more when you do yours, just drop them in. Nice clean dry brush"
Bob Ross,"I want to create the illusion of mist down here at the base. Right down here at the base, just like so. There, just tapping, just tapping"
Bob Ross,"Up here well tap softer, cause we dont wanna destroy up here. All we wanna do up here is diffuse. Down here were getting tough and mean cause were destroying. We wanna create softness. But here"
Bob Ross,"Barely. You can probably hear the difference. Barely touching up here, gentle, easy, easy. There, okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can take a knife, just a little bit of that same color, and just sort of pull it through here and there, and itll make the indication of little trunks"
Bob Ross,"Were not really gonna put a lot of detail in these, theyre too far away, but thisll turn a few trees into something that looks like a lot of trees. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, tell you what, lets get crazy. This is our world so we can do anything. Maybe theres a little bush that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"Well just go back to the little oval brush and just tap in the indication of maybe one little happy bush that lives right there. Something like so. There. Shoot, we got it made"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, well just use this ol two-inch brush here. What the heck, you could use a one-inch brush or a fan brush, whatever. Im gonna go into a little bit of the yellow"
Bob Ross,"Ill be right back, get a little Sap Green. Just mix all these different colors, and give it a little push. There, its a good shot right there"
Bob Ross,"Just a little push, get a little color right on the tips of the bristles, a little bit of color. Alright, now then, lets make a big decision"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a nice grassy area in our world, and it comes right down like that. All you have to do is just tap"
Bob Ross,"The more that you tap, the darker itll become, because its gonna mix with that black thats already on the canvas, and thatll happen automatically for you. Automatically. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now, once in awhile, make a little sparkle. Add a least little touch of Titanium White, but very little. If you use too much, youll lose the effectiveness of this"
Bob Ross,"So, it looks like theres a little light just zinging right through that. Then, as we go down, get darker and darker. Back in here, its in the shadows. We dont want much back in here"
Bob Ross,"Very quiet back in there. You just put layer after layer after layer of little grassy areas. There. You know what. Shoot, this is such a beautiful little spot, Ill tell you what lets do"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, Im gonna do it. chuckles I wanna little house right here. If this is my world, Id wanna live right in here. So, lets just take the knife, what the heck, and well scrape out"
Bob Ross,"All Im doing here is scraping out a basic design for a little house, it might even be a little chalet-type thing. I dont know, whatever. No, well have it lower. Just make a decision and drop it in"
Bob Ross,You can do anything here. A little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Well put the back eave in first. Thats easy. Here comes the front. Nice straight edge right along there. There it goes
Bob Ross,"Im pushing this paint into the fabric, dont worry about the bottom. Well do a cabin-ectomy when we get to that point, and then well make big decisions"
Bob Ross,"There we go, just whack that right off when we get ready. See there. Now, we need the other side of the roof. There it is. Maybe it comes to about there. I dont know, wherever you want it to be"
Bob Ross,"Wherever. Some sides over here. Lets really get crazy. Maybe this guy put a little room out here on this little house, so we can do that, too. Maybe it comes from right here, see"
Bob Ross,"Got another little area, that easy. Thats whats so fantastic about this, you can change your mind, do anything that you want, make up little stories, just let these things happen"
Bob Ross,"Let it come down, and all were doing is just blocking in color, thats really all were doing. Thats all were doing. There. Okay, now then, lets take some Bright Red"
Bob Ross,"Bright Red, some Dark Sienna, and lets mix those together, like so. Im gonna put a little touch of Yellow Ochre in there, too. Its such a beautiful day here. I hope it is where youre at"
Bob Ross,"Well just sparkle this up. Cut off our little roll of paint. Just a small roll of paint. Lets begin, coming right down here, barely touching. Barely, barely touching. No pressure"
Bob Ross,"No pressure at all, like so. Maybe even a little touch more of the Yellow Ochre and, shoot, well even put a little white in there. I want this to sparkle a little more"
Bob Ross,"Oh, thats it, thats it, thats what were looking for. Look at that, isnt that something. There we go. Over in here, well put a little bit right in there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe there is a little dark area in between these two. You can do that. Now, gotta put something on the roof for that. Im just gonna take some black and Titanium White and just mix it together"
Bob Ross,"Put a little bit of the Van Dyke Brown in there, just to give it. Leave it marbled, dont overmix it. Well come right down here, and all you do is touch and just let it bounce"
Bob Ross,"Bloop bloop bloop bloop. Gotta make that little noise or it doesnt work. Just touch it, and let the knife just bounce as it works right down here. Look at that, see. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"On this part of the roof, since it comes this way, touch, and once again just let it bounce, let it bounce, right on down, right on down. There we go, alright"
Bob Ross,"Now, this is a much darker color, and well come right in here. Same color but darker, and put it in the front of this rascal"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes on these edges its nice to put a nice bright area so they really stand out, so the edges stand out from each other. Darken this one a little bit. Joom, there we are"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, we got a heck of a little house, there. Thats coming along pretty nice. Well take a little bit of the Van Dyke Brown, and lets make the indication of some boards here"
Bob Ross,"There we are, see how easy you can make that look like its old boards"
Bob Ross,"If you wanna soften that, if you want to make it look very soft and smooth, you can take the large brush, and lightly, barely, barely, barely caressing the canvas, just pull gently down. Gently down"
Bob Ross,"You know what we need. We need a door. Gotta have a way to get in there. So, that easy, well put us in a little door. There"
Bob Ross,"Just cut right around there with a little bit of light color just to make that good old door stand out. Shoot, tell you what. Over here, maybe theres a window"
Bob Ross,"When he put that section of the house in, maybe he wanted a way to look out and see all this beautiful scenery. There we go. A few little board indications over here"
Bob Ross,"And a little touch of roof on the other side. You gotta have that there, so it stands out. Shoot, thats not a bad lookin little house. I sorta like that. Sorta like it. Now well do our cabin-ectomy"
Bob Ross,"This is where you make the big decisions and decide where everythings at, and fix up your perspective and your shape. Alright. There"
Bob Ross,"Now, we go back into our brush that has the greens and the yellows and all that on it. There we are. Just tap, load the brush with color. Well come right up here. Look at there"
Bob Ross,"We can begin laying in some grassy areas all around the little cabin there. There we go. Just sort of let em happen, very dark back here. This guys like me, he dont cut his yard very well"
Bob Ross,"chuckles Im the worlds worst yard keeper. There we go. You know what we need in here. We need a way to get to that place. Shoot, Im about to put him out there and leave him deserted"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some Van Dyke Brown, we just use a fan brush. You could use a knife and do this if you wanted to. Im just gonna use the fan brush, cause I have one laying here and its dirty"
Bob Ross,"Well just lay on a little brown, have a little path that comes right out here. Ill show you, Ill show you"
Bob Ross,"Well take a knife, take a little bit of the browns and whites and very gently, very gently, very gently, just caress. Just barely caress, just enough to give a little color. There. Alright, now then"
Bob Ross,"Back to our old two-inch brush, and just begin tapping. Just begin tapping. Thinking about the lay of the land, though. Thats very important. Here we go. Just fill these areas in"
Bob Ross,"Once again, the more you tap this the darker itll become, but if you work with this a little bit you can make it as smooth as velvet"
Bob Ross,Look just like little soft grassy areas where make you wanna take your shoe off and run through there with naked foots. Grass feels good when it touches on your foots
Bob Ross,"Over on this side, dont want it left out. Just begin putting in little things to bring it all together. Maybe here, in there, theres a little bump"
Bob Ross,"Just by changing the angle, you can make the indication of a little bump right there. All kind of little hills, here and there. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, tell you what, well use our little script liner brush. Well use a little Titanium White. Maybe theres a little birch tree that lives right there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little clump of birch trees, we dont know. Just put two or three little trees, or however many you want in your world. There they go. Like so"
Bob Ross,"Now then, well just use that oval brush again. Shoot, thats working so well today. A little bit of color, and well just put the indication here and there. Look at that"
Bob Ross,"See, a few little leaves on that tree dont wanna be left out. This side needs something over here. Tell you what, we got a minute left here, maybe over here theres a big ol post"
Bob Ross,"Maybe there was a fence here at one time, and its still there. Maybe theres a couple posts. Maybe theres three posts. chuckles We keep goin here, well have our fence back, wont we"
Bob Ross,"And we have a little light playing through here. Theres a light source, so we know exactly where the lights coming from in this painting"
Bob Ross,"Just touch, and begin putting a little bit of highlight on that side, a little bit on this one, dont want him left out. And ol number three here"
Bob Ross,Maybe on top of our post well put a little touch of red. There. We can go back to our liner brush. Well use a little brown. Whatever. See if that stands out enough
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add a little white to that, its too dark. There, just to put the indication that maybe theres still a little wire hanging through here. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Thats just brown and white, so it stands out a little. Tell you what, while we got that ol brush going were still using Van Dyke Brown. Theres a fence back here, maybe. Yep, youre right"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a fence here, and it goes right over the hill. We dont know where it goes. Dont know that we care. Shoot, well put some nice ol rails across there. There they go, right on"
Bob Ross,"Maybe its three. There. Now, we can put the least little touch of color up on top of that. Something like so. There, now then, okay"
Bob Ross,"I wanna use a little green, a little bit of the black, I wanna get a least little touch of Phthalo Blue and put in there, too. Oh yeah, that makes a nice dark green"
Bob Ross,"Oh yeah, a little Phthalo Blue really sparkled it. Put a little touch right down here at the base of that, so the little post has something to sit on. Dont want it left out"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, just take a little paint thinner, and well go right into some Bright Red here, and I think well sign this one. Its about finished"
Bob Ross,"Luckily, I have a very short name, so its quite easy to do, but make your paint as thin as ink once again. I hope youve enjoyed this painting, its quite interesting"
Bob Ross,"Itll give you a little challenge and let you use all the equipment. From all of us here, Id like you wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. upbeat jazzy music"
Bob Ross,"You know, in the last show, I had one of my little friends here, little fox squirrel, and so many people have called and wrote in because I mentioned we have four of them and they wanted to see the"
Bob Ross,rest of them. Ive asked a friend to come today to help me because its a son of a gun trying to hang on to four
Bob Ross,"This is Dana Jester, and hes one of our instructors that travels all over the country and teaches people the joy of painting, and as you can see, he has an armful"
Bob Ross,"What do you got going on there, Dana. - Oh, I dont know. Your kids are going while here, boy. - Here, look at here. You want a little bit to drink. - I think theyre hungry"
Bob Ross,"- Yeah, its time for them to have a little nibble. Look at this. Arent they the cutest little devils though. - I know theyre excited, thats for sure"
Bob Ross,"- Well, this is a big deal for them to be in front of the cameras and, theyre a little nervous but theyre still hungry. They still like to eat. Here you go. There, isnt that something"
Bob Ross,"Look at these little devils. They are absolutely precious and I, I thank Dana very much for coming and helping me today. Here, turn loose, guy. Okay. - Dana I know these guys arent mumbles"
Bob Ross,- Let me get this one here. I got one in my arm here. Lets give this one a little bit. You want a little drink. There. Isnt that something. There we go. They are so cute
Bob Ross,"They are just absolutely precious. And as I say, these are little fox squirrels and theyre very young and there. Okay. Tell you what, let me set those down and lets get a painting started for today"
Bob Ross,"Today, we have our standard old 18 by 24-inch canvas up here and weve covered it with a nice, thin, even coat of the liquid white, and its nice and wet and its ready to go so why dont we take off"
Bob Ross,"and maybe today well do a happy little winter scene, and maybe well put a little color in it so its not quite so cold"
Bob Ross,"Im going to take a little touch of the Indian Yellow, just a very, very small amount on the two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Very small amount, and lets come right up in here, and lets just put in a little touch of the yellowish color, something, maybe like so"
Bob Ross,"Maybe like so, and were going to run all the colors across the screen for you so you know what were doing here"
Bob Ross,"Almost forgot to tell you that, I got involved with the squirrels and son of a gun, almost forgot it there. All right"
Bob Ross,"Now then, without cleaning the brush, Im going to take a little touch of Yellow Ochre, just a little, dont need much. There we go. Take that and well come right in here"
Bob Ross,"Im just using little criss-cross strokes. There, you can see it, see. Just little xs. Well just bring this right around like so There we are. Okay, and we just, just blend this. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and just blend it til you cant tell where one color stops and the next color starts, all right. Now, then maybe a little color right up in here"
Bob Ross,"Once again, without cleaning the brush, Im going to take a little tiny bit of the Bright Red, very little amount, and lets go right up in here. And we just drop a little of that in. Now then"
Bob Ross,Sometimes winter scenes can be so cold that theyre almost unpleasant
Bob Ross,I like to make winter scenes that have a little bit of a bright color in them and it really makes them pretty and makes you feel good in here. Lets take a little Pthalo Blue and Alizarin Crimson
Bob Ross,"Ill just mix these on the brush. Proportionately though, much more crimson than the blue. The blue is many, many times stronger. There we are. Crimson and pthalo blue, take a little touch of that"
Bob Ross,"And lets just, lets just put a little bit of that right in like so. Still using the little criss-cross strokes. There. Okay. Now, we just fill the sky up, just fill it up"
Bob Ross,"Now, you can use this lavender color against the yellow without it turning bright green because if you mix lavender with yellow, it just makes a pleasant brown and thats okay. We can live with that"
Bob Ross,"We can live with that, but if you were to use pure blue and you touched the yellow chuckles, as you know, we would have bright, bright green and we dont want that in this particular painting. Okay"
Bob Ross,And well just wipe this down here. This is going to be a little winter scene. Maybe well have some snow down here and well just use this as part of the shadows when we get finished
Bob Ross,"Its also a good place to clean the color off your brush. Now then, speaking of cleaning color off the brush, lets wash our old brush. Shake off the excess. chuckles And then off you go"
Bob Ross,"Im going to take a little bit of the titanium white now, right on the little two-inch brush or the big two-inch brush, whichever, just a little color, thats all we need, and lets go right up in"
Bob Ross,"here. This is going to be our light source. Lets make this quite bright and quite shiny. But a clean brush with a little white on it, titanium white. Use the titanium because its firm"
Bob Ross,"You dont want to use the liquid white. There. Liquid white is just a base that we put on the canvas so the color blends on the, right on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can begin blending this right together. Just like that. And you can blend it to any degree of softness or you can leave it quite harsh. Its up to you. Its totally up to you"
Bob Ross,"Painting is very individual. There now, very lightly, we can just begin blending this out til it gets as smooth as you want it. There. Okay. But isnt that a wild sky"
Bob Ross,"Its very easy, and when youre doing this at home, I suggest that you stand back and look at your painting"
Bob Ross,Its very difficult when youre very close to it to tell if your colors are blended sufficiently. All right. Good. There we go. Very effective and very soft little sky. Wash your brush again
Bob Ross,"laughs I just like to wash the brush. I look for any excuse. Tell you what, lets have a nice mountain ridge up through here, and for that, Ill just keep using this lavender color"
Bob Ross,"Ill put a little black in it, so we have black, alizarin crimson, a little bit of pthalo blue. Just midnight black and alizarin crimson by itself will make a very nice lavender color. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Pull the paint out as flat as you can get it, cut across and get our tiny, little roll of paint right there. Okay, lets go up here. Now, you gotta make your first major decision in this painting"
Bob Ross,"Where does, where does your little ridge of mountains live. Maybe ours lives right up here. Wherever you want, and the only thing that were worried about at this point is the top edge of this"
Bob Ross,"We could care less whats happening anywhere else, just on the top here. There we are. Really hope you enjoyed seeing all those little squirrels. They are so precious"
Bob Ross,"And if youve been with me before, you know that Im sort of a fanatic for all of Gods little creatures and. Especially little squirrels and stuff. I really like those. Those are loner squirrels"
Bob Ross,"I have three little gray squirrels that Im raising, and they came from another bird lady who lives in Orlando, and shes allowing me to raise these other ones at home and, if you think thats not a"
Bob Ross,"chore, you try taking care of three little baby squirrels at one time, its like having three children. Will certainly, certainly keep you busy"
Bob Ross,"Im just using a two-inch brush here, and my mother helps me with the little squirrels sometimes and she gets a kick out of feeding them too. Theyre a great deal of fun"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, just putting some food out in your yard or something, you can attract a multitude of little creatures, squirrels and birds and et cetera, and, personally, I think theyre just fantastic to"
Bob Ross,watch. There we go
Bob Ross,"And we need to take care of these little creatures because theyre sort of, theyre sort of the barometer to tell you how the ecology is doing and how were taking care of this old world"
Bob Ross,"The animals disappear, guess whos next. There. Enough of my ecology kick. Im going to take a little touch of the bright red and go right into some titanium white"
Bob Ross,"I want very little paint, or very little red in this paint. Just enough to give it a little flavor. Then we get a tiny little roll of paint. Very little paint right out on the edge of the blade. Okay"
Bob Ross,I thought maybe today wed just do a little ridge of mountains and all you do is just touch and just let it gently flow down. No pressure. Cant say that enough. Absolutely no pressure
Bob Ross,"The more delicate the touch, the nicer this will look, and well just start working some of these little areas. I dont want this to look like one of our big mountains that we normally do"
Bob Ross,"I want it to look like a little ridge. I want to take a little black and white, little touch of that lavender into it, just to make a shadow color and we can start here and there"
Bob Ross,"Well just start adding a few little shadows in here. There. Midnight black, little white and little bit of the lavender color that we used to make the base of the mountain here"
Bob Ross,"Thats really all we have. Very light, very gentle. Dont want, we dont want much color up here. Very gentle, there. This is where we test to see if you have a delicate touch. There"
Bob Ross,"When I was in British Columbia, theres a lot of mountain ridges that look like this. Lot of em, and theyre so striking. Some of the most beautiful country. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe, over in here, we got little, little doers here and there, wherever you want. Just make some decisions, drop em in"
Bob Ross,You may also find that its a little easier to get into some of these places using the small knife. There we are. Whichever is comfortable for you
Bob Ross,"Thats the reason we designed a couple of different knives. Just so you can, you can try it until you find the one that works the best for you. Some people like the large knife only"
Bob Ross,"Some people like the small knife. Its really an individual thing. There we go. And here and there, maybe theres something little, might even be a little peak here and there, a little bump"
Bob Ross,"Let your imagination take you wherever, wherever. Big thing here is I dont want much paint. Were going to blend most of this out. All were looking for here is just some little indications"
Bob Ross,"And we just sort of vary it back and forth between the shadow and the highlight color and even sometimes to show something really deep, well take a little dark, make a deep shadow in there"
Bob Ross,"This is just the base color, a little bit of the base color and you can play it here and there. There, see. Just, but not much of it"
Bob Ross,"Its very strong and very quickly, itll, itll take over your whole world, so just a small, small amount. And you can play with these for hours if you want to"
Bob Ross,"You dont have to paint this fast at home. You dont, use your old VCR and record it and do it at your own leisure. There. Hope you enjoyed seeing Dana again. Danas been on quite a few of the shows"
Bob Ross,Hes really an outstanding young artist
Bob Ross,"And he lives here in Muncie, so a lot of times when Im here filming, he comes over and keeps me company in the studio and so one day we decided to put him to work"
Bob Ross,"Enough of that sitting around, taking life easy. There. Okay. Now then, lets blend this out a little"
Bob Ross,"And when youre doing this, you dont have to be real careful because were going to blend the whole thing"
Bob Ross,"Im going to tap the bottom because I want the bottom to be very soft and very misty, very diffused and then very lightly, almost all the way to the top, begin blending. See"
Bob Ross,Thats the reason we didnt have to be very careful because youre going to blend it and soften it and that will bring it all together. There. Mmm
Bob Ross,"I like these little paintings that are very soft, but you could do this so its very sharp. Its an individual thing. Do it any way that you want"
Bob Ross,"All we want to do is show you how to do it and give you a couple ideas. There. Okay, maybe back in here well have some little trees and stuff. Tell you what, lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a some van dyke brown, a little dark sienna, well just mix them together, and I want to take a little white and throw it in there too just to lighten it up, maybe a little more"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Im looking for sort of a medium brown color. Whoo, I hit a little of that lavender too. Thats all right. Okay, let me wipe my knife. Thats all right"
Bob Ross,"Cause you know, we dont make mistakes. We have happy accidents and thats when you really experience the joy of painting. All right, now then, load the old fan brush full of color, lot of color"
Bob Ross,"Lot of color. Lets go up in here. Now, maybe back here in our world, there lives some little distant trees and theyre back in here"
Bob Ross,All you have to do is take the fan brush and sort of tap it downward and begin thinking about basic shapes and where you want them to live and just begin tapping. Thats really all there is to it
Bob Ross,"There they go. Now, sometimes, let me show you something here. Sometimes I get letters and people say, My background trees look like fence posts, like that"
Bob Ross,"The only thing wrong right there is you dont have enough. If you just go back, if that happens, just add in a few more. These are a lot of trees that are far, far away in the distance"
Bob Ross,"Far away in the distance. There we go. Maybe they come over, shoot, maybe it goes up here. Its up to you. Anywhere you want it. Anywhere that you want it. There we are. Okay. Maybe right on up there"
Bob Ross,"I dont know, wherever you want it. So I tell you, this is such an individual thing. Its the reason we dont, we dont really want to have you just use patterns and trace and et cetera"
Bob Ross,We really would like to see people learn to be creative on their own. And this is the freest style of painting I have ever seen. Maybe theres one here that you can see a little more detail. See
Bob Ross,"That easy cause it just looks like you were to be there. Now then, I want to create the illusion of mist down at the base of these"
Bob Ross,"Very firmly, using the top corner only of the two inch brush, Im just tapping, but very firmly. You can probably hear how much were tapping here. You see our new opening on the show"
Bob Ross,"Aint that fantastic. Thats the little painter man. The little painter man. And, that was done by a fantastic engineer right here at the station where we film"
Bob Ross,He put all that together and designed it and figured out how to do it and his name is Jerry Morton and Id like to give him credit for doing a super job. He put a lot of work into making that
Bob Ross,"I hope you like it. Id love to hear from you and know what you think of it, but were going to call that little character the little painter man, and maybe well show him again sometime. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe we want to have several layers in here,  so well take that same color  and I want to add a little bit more of the van dyke brown to it"
Bob Ross,"As you know, in a landscape, as things get closer to you, they should get darker in value, so all you need to do is add a little more of the brown, so lets go back up in here and maybe, right here"
Bob Ross,"Right here, I know whispers inaudibly. But see how that dark color stands out now against that misty area"
Bob Ross,"If you didnt have that little misty area, wed probably be in agony city right now because it would just blend together and you would lose it"
Bob Ross,"But because you have that little misty area, then youre in business and theyll separate. Misty areas, Ive said over and over, is your good friend"
Bob Ross,"And painting, sometimes softness or little misty areas do more good for you than anything else. Tell you what. Tell you what, lets get crazy. Maybe theres a nice tree. Yup, there is now"
Bob Ross,"Lives right there. Just use a corner of the fan brush. And there we go, back and forth. There. Happy little evergreen lives right there. And he needs a friend"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this guy, maybe a squirrel chewed off all his limbs when he was little, them little devils do that sometimes, so well just put a few on him. So hes sort of naked. There we go. There, see"
Bob Ross,But you can see part of the trunk through there. And sometimes thats very nice
Bob Ross,"Clean, dry brush and once again, once again, our little misty effect, and well just let it come right on out and just blend off into nothing there at the end, and there"
Bob Ross,But you can create layer after layer after layer of little foothills and little soft areas in between that gives your painting tremendous depth
Bob Ross,"Tremendous depth, and of course, I know none of us are interested in that happy buck, but if youre out selling your paintings, this is what makes your painting special over everybody elses"
Bob Ross,"Just the fact that it has all this depth and distance in it, and when somebody comes along to buy a painting, theyll look at yours and hmm, guess who sells the painting. This pays great dividends"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, all right. Now, we said its gonna have snow down here. Lets put one more layer of foothills. Shoot, I want to tell you, I like those little foothills"
Bob Ross,Im going to take that ol big brush that Ive got going here. Ill use a little lavender. This is just the alizarin crimson and a touch of pthalo blue
Bob Ross,"Once again, proportionately, much more crimson than blue, just tap. Okay, lets go back up here. Maybe these foothills live right here, and all were doing right now is putting in a base color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well, these are getting close enough, maybe theyll get a little highlight on them. What the heck. Just make big decisions and drop em in, let em go. There it goes, there it goes. There"
Bob Ross,Wherever you think they should live. Its exactly where they should live. Now then. Thats our base color. And thats really all it is
Bob Ross,"This could be put on, shoot, you could put this over your shoe, it doesnt matter, doesnt matter. There we go. Lets take another brush here"
Bob Ross,"I have several of each brush going so I dont have to spend all my time washing brushes. Im gonna dip it into a touch of the liquid white, just a touch, very small amount"
Bob Ross,"Thats right above a smidgen. Little, teeny bit, and let me reach right down here, be right back though. I wont go away. Little bright red in there. exhales Takes very little, very little. Now then"
Bob Ross,Just tap. Push. You can see that little ridge of paint. Lets pull it out very flat so you can see it good. See that little ridge
Bob Ross,Theres a ridge just like that on the end of the brush and thats what we paint with. Lets go up here
Bob Ross,"Now then, well use just a corner of the brush and we go in here and we can begin putting in some nice, little highlights on these. In my mind, these are getting closer now"
Bob Ross,"Now, the little touch of liquid white that I put in there was put in there only to thin this a little bit because as you know, one of our golden rules, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint, the"
Bob Ross,"paint that we use is very, very thick, very dry. Its much thicker than traditional oil paints. There, and then we can paint layer after layer on top without just becoming a mud mixer"
Bob Ross,"If all your paints are the same consistency, its just going to make mud. Its all thats going to happen and then youre going to be unhappy with me. Watch. Heres a little trick"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, lets do this. Maybe right here, theres another little, another little plane, whole nother plane. See. Just let them separate"
Bob Ross,"And that little dark area in between is all you need to create the illusion of a little separation. Its all you need. Okay, now then, we said this was winter, so lets have some snow"
Bob Ross,We need some snow in here. Just use a titanium white. Weve got a little touch of that pinkish color left on the brush. Touch and pull
Bob Ross,"Decide, decide in your world where this is going to live and drop it in. There. See. And with a big brush, you can do this very rapidly. It didnt take but a second. Just let that blend right on back"
Bob Ross,"But see the depth it creates. Just because you left that in there. Now then. We need some big trees, you know me. chuckles I like them big trees"
Bob Ross,"But now, in yours, if you dont want a big tree, dont put it in. Im going to use some of that lavender and some of that brown mixed together. Just load it up on this old two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,Make some big decisions. Where does our little trees live in our world. I think they live right about here. There they go
Bob Ross,"There they go, and all were doing here is just putting in a little color so well have something for a highlight to stick to, just a base color, thats all were looking for. There"
Bob Ross,"Lets take, well go back to the old two-inch brush that we were using, has a little bright red on it, a little of titanium white and lets go back in here and just put the indication of some nice"
Bob Ross,little snow-covered things that live up here on this tree. Its just like if we were putting green leaves up here. Think about form and shape. Dont just throw this on at random
Bob Ross,Its most important that it gives shape and form to your tree. Most important
Bob Ross,"Mm, in some parts of the country, when winter comes and Jack Frost plays through the trees, you get all of these beautiful things just hanging around. There we are. So, heres another one"
Bob Ross,"Maybe it lives right here. And it just goes right on out to about there. There, wherever. Another one right there. And you put just as many or as few as you want in your world. Now then"
Bob Ross,"We want to pull a little of this out into the snow to create the illusion of a shadow and it shows another plane, just the fact that it moves there. A whole nother plane in your painting"
Bob Ross,"But snow is one of the easiest things to paint when you have a big old brush like this. Take a little touch of the liquid white. Now, we can put the indication here and there of just a little trunk"
Bob Ross,"Wherever we want it. There we are. We just want to show some indications. Just a few. Then, we can take the knife and just scrape in some sticks and twigs. There"
Bob Ross,"There and there, a little bush that lives right down like that. So its not just a straight line and pull that out too. All right. Lets have some fun over here"
Bob Ross,"On the other side, well go into a little brown. Let me get a little paint thinner on the liner brush. And, maybe in our world, there lives shoooooom, this is your bravery test"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, there it is, a happy little tree, and maybe this one, maybe this ones naked out here. There, yeah. Okay. Lets give him some arms"
Bob Ross,"I got a letter from a man one time, saying he didnt believe me, Id even given the trees arms and legs and foots and names, but thats all right"
Bob Ross,"In your world, if you want the trees to have foots, you can do that. If you want them to have arms, if you want to give them names. There we go. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe, maybe theres a few little sticks and twigs, some baby trees growing around here. Right down like so. And lets take a fan brush. Take an old fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Were about out of time for today so Ill just show you, take a little lavender color, a little bit more into the reddish hue, there"
Bob Ross,"A little alizarin crimson and pthalo blue, put a little hill right there, little touch of our white. Grab it and let that just move right off into the snow. See how easy that is"
Bob Ross,"Its also an excellent way to make little sand dunes if youre doing little seascapes. That easy. Shoot, I think we about have a finished painting. Try this"
Bob Ross,"I think its a very warm winter scene that youll enjoy doing. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today. You ready to do a fantastic little painting. Super"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets start out the day and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me"
Bob Ross,"And as usual theyll come across in the same orders we have them on the pallet, starting with the white and working around. But when you load your own pallet load it anyway thats convenient to you"
Bob Ross,"Its just we sort got in the habit of loading it this way. Up here today, lets see what we have"
Bob Ross,"Today I have contact paper on my canvas with an oval cut out of the center and this is just normal ol, adhesive back paper that you can buy at the hardware store or the grocery store"
Bob Ross,"And we cut a little oval out and stick it on there and then Ive covered the inside here with a thin even coat of the liquid white. And so its wet and ready to go. So, lets do a little painting"
Bob Ross,Thought today wed just do a very soft little painting thats a lot of fun. Start out with the least little amount of yellow ochre
Bob Ross,"Just wanna put a little happy spot up here in the sky, just a little bit of color but I dont want much"
Bob Ross,"I think today well try to do a painting thats very soft, and subdued, and quiet, and I like those kind of little paintings. There, very little color"
Bob Ross,"You can always add more but its a son of a gun to take it off. So just, you can take it off but its easier just to add a little at a time. Maybe well, lets have a little water down here"
Bob Ross,"Were reflect a little of that right into the water. But very little color, very little. Now then, Im gonna mix up a little lavender color. Ill use a knife to mix it"
Bob Ross,"Well take some alizarin crimson and a little phthalo blue proportionately. Much, much more of the crimson than the blue. But yet I want this to be a little bit to the blue side"
Bob Ross,"When youre making lavender like this you can take it to the reddish side or the blue side. I want this to be a little to the blueish side. Put a little white, and then check it"
Bob Ross,"Ooh, thats nice, good flavor. Its hard to tell what color this is. Thats why we add a little white out there so we can see it. Now then, clean off the ol knife"
Bob Ross,And lets go back up here in our sky and well take a little touch of that color. I have not cleaned the brush. Just a little of that color. Little of that color
Bob Ross,"I want to add a tiny little bit of the blue, ooh, thats better. I want it a little bit more to the blue side. There. Okay, thats much better. Lets go up in here. Yes, thats a nice color"
Bob Ross,I like that. And theres not a great deal of paint on the brush. Its really not a lot of paint. Because the canvas is wet this paint will go a long way. Doesnt take a great deal. There we are
Bob Ross,Something maybe sort of like that. And it really doesnt matter. Whatever makes ya happy cause painting is very individual. Theres as many different ways to paint as there are painters
Bob Ross,"And every person sees nature through different eyes. So, when youre doing your own paintings paint what makes you happy. There we are. Gonna have some water we said"
Bob Ross,"Lets just go ahead and put in little indications of some water about right there, like so. All were doing is adding a little color"
Bob Ross,"We can come back and change it or move it however we want it later but while we have the brush dirty might as well use it. There we go. Now then, lets do the fun part of this"
Bob Ross,"Lets wash this ol brush, just give it a good scrubbing here. There we are. Shake off the excess. laughs I just beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,"All right, lets go right up in here, and just blend this together"
Bob Ross,"In one of their earlier series we showed one of camera people, and we showed him in a rain coat, cause it gets a little tricky around here with all this paint splashing around the studio"
Bob Ross,"So, sometimes Richard puts on a little raincoat and he sets behind the camera there. There we go. Just wanna blend this till it blends together extremely soft"
Bob Ross,You dont wanna see any dark spots or light spots. We wanna very soft transition from light to dark. There we are. Down here just gently go across and we can bring this together till its very smooth
Bob Ross,"But we wanna maintain this little light spot here. Thats important to me right now. And maybe back in the background here a little of that lavender color still, little bit. There we go"
Bob Ross,"This is just phthalo blue and alizarin crimson. Little bit on the corner of the brush. Now then, maybe theres some little, little bushes and trees that live back here"
Bob Ross,"Just using the top corner of the brush and I dont want these to be very distinct. I want them to be very quiet, gentle, soft, way back in the distance. There, there. Just let it blend"
Bob Ross,We dont know exactly where they go. Itd be nice if they would just sort of disappear right up here. There
Bob Ross,Now I like very soft paintings personally but if you wanna make it a little more distinct thats certainly your right and we encourage it
Bob Ross,"If you like it a little brighter, a little more distinct, please, please, do that. Dont just try to copy. Im serious when I say were really tryin to teach you a technique, there"
Bob Ross,"If theres a frame shop in your neighborhood and they have an oval cutter, for cutting mats you can take a little adhesive back paper and take it down toem, cut it in the size that you want it,"
Bob Ross,"overall size, and go to a frame shop and they can zip it out for you in just a second. Theyll probably charge you a little bit but not much"
Bob Ross,Or the other way when frame shops cut ovals they normally throw the oval part away when they cut it out of cardboard or art-board. They usually throw the oval away
Bob Ross,A lot of times frame shops will just give you that part and you can take that part and take it and lay it on some contact paper or any kind of adhesive back paper
Bob Ross,"And I take an exacto knife, and just run it right around there, the cardboard cutout, and that easy. You can cut or you can do it with scissors"
Bob Ross,"I got a little paint thinner here on my liner brush, and a little of the same exact color, and I just want to put the indication here in there of some quiet little branches that live back in here"
Bob Ross,"Just a few, cant see many. Just a few here and there but not to distinct. Once again I really would like for this to be quiet and gentle little painting"
Bob Ross,And you can take a little of the titanium white with paint thinner and maybe in our world theres one here thats sort of white
Bob Ross,"Theres a lot of little white sticks in nature too and little white trunk trees, not only birch tress but all kind of little things that grow that are white or gray"
Bob Ross,"Theyre nice, useem in your paintings. Lets see here well grab a little fan brush. Sometimes its fun"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little titanium white, reach right down here, and get a little bit of the yellow ochre, and mix it with the titanium white. Mostly titanium white though, just enough yellow to color it"
Bob Ross,"There we are, lets go up here. Maybe theres some little bushes that live right in here, and theres some light zinging through, and just makinem sparkle"
Bob Ross,"Take the corner of the brush, and I have the number three fan brush here, and all Im gonna do is go to push upward, just push it, just sort of scrub it, and push it. There we are. See there"
Bob Ross,Theres all there is to it is very simple but you can make little bushes that are back in the distance. Very quiet little devils that live back in here. There
Bob Ross,"And sort of vary the colors so there all not just exactly, ooh thats nice. That ones got a little more ochre in it. I sort of like it. Maybe Ill put a little more in here too"
Bob Ross,"I like it thats good, effective. Somewhere right in there, we dont know where they go. Any ol where that you wantem"
Bob Ross,"Lets take our knife, a little dark sienna, a little van dyke brown, put a little white in there. Just mix it with the knife right here on the ol pallet"
Bob Ross,"Now we need a little land in here and I want this to be very dark so Im just rubbing it so it picks up the liquid white thats underneath here and all these things just, they just sort of come"
Bob Ross,"together. But I dont want it to be real dark. Maybe it comes all the way across here, just, whatever"
Bob Ross,"Now then, our little fan brush that we had the little bush color on, the white and yellow ochre, you can go back and just pop in some little bushy areas that come down on this land"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of bring it together so you dont see distinct edges. There. Now I have several fan brushes going but maybe in our world here, lets do it. I see something here"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna a little bit of the liquid white, titanium white, mix them together. Be right back, dont go away, there. A little touch of the phthalo blue, little touch"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world there lives just a little happy waterfall that comes along, drops in there, splashes a little bit, play, comes right over that, so now you can see a little dark right through it,"
Bob Ross,"like as a little stone or some dirt or something under there, whatever you want. Maybe, this is pretty rough water. There it went but think about that"
Bob Ross,"Think about water just floating along here and having a good time, a real good time, and somebody says bloop, pulls the bottom out. And thats the way to make the water look correct"
Bob Ross,"Just straight and then over. There we go, little splashes here and there, and there and here. We can begin working that out, kay. Shoot, we better put something in here before we get to far along"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna make that nice brown color. Tell you what, let me clean off a spot to work here well just set that over there in case we need it later"
Bob Ross,"I wanna take sap green, well make a very nice brown, and alizarin crimson. And about equal parts, roughly equal parts, and you wanna really mix these up good"
Bob Ross,"Sap green and alizarin crimson, this makes one of the most beautiful browns but you really have to mix it well. All right, there"
Bob Ross,"And when youre mixing paint to mix it well lift it completely off the palete, turn it over. That way both sides get stirred up. All right, lemme clean off the ol knife"
Bob Ross,"Now then, well use the two inch brush. Im gonna go right in, load a little color onto the bristles, just load a little color, like so"
Bob Ross,"All right, maybe theres some happy little bushes that live right here. Using just the corner, just begin tapping in some very basic little shapes wherever you think they should live"
Bob Ross,"There we are, see. Maybe in our world they come right out through here, I dont know. Theres a nice little bush. He lives there"
Bob Ross,"He lives right there and hes got a friend there, and maybe another one up here, whatever. Just think about all these little critters that live out here, make friends withem"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we had all that, thered be some reflections in the water so well just take a little of that color, pull straight down, like so"
Bob Ross,"Now, if you wanted to paint this picture without the oval you certainly can do that, just leave it off. Can do easy, no big deal"
Bob Ross,"Maybe on the other side over here, Im gonna use that same color but I wanna add a little white to it. I want it to be a little lighter. Same color loaded the same way, just by pushing"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here. Maybe in this side, lets do this. Maybe we have some bigger trees that live over here. And in my mind these are farther away then these so I want them to be a little lighter"
Bob Ross,"And we just sort of let them, maybe they go all the way to the top, what the heck, lets go all the way up here"
Bob Ross,"Sort of big ol tree that hangs over here and watches the little water fall back in the background. Just watches that little water fall, has a good time out here, enjoys life. There"
Bob Ross,"And some darker color and maybe it comes right out here to the ground area. All right, see you begin seeing things here"
Bob Ross,After youve painted a little while and you get over the initial fear of touching brush to canvas then it becomes so much fun because you not worried about making mistakes
Bob Ross,"When our instructors like, well like Dana that you met in the last series or my son Steve, when these instructors are teaching people one of the first things they tellem is dont worry about making"
Bob Ross,"mistakes because theres nothing on the canvas that they cant fix. Now Im gonna add a little touch of lavender, that same lavender color, right here"
Bob Ross,"I wanna pull a little of that dark down, I wanna little dark in here. This is just that same lavender, alizarin crimson, phthalo blue, I wanna add it right in there. There, Iike it"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little on this side too, just to darken it up a little and put a little of the same background color into our reflections but not a great deal. There we go, very nice"
Bob Ross,"And add a little more to that tree. Im gonna put another tree in front of him I think so not to worried about that. Probably just use the same brush, it doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Go right into a little yellow ochre, little touch of cad yellow, Indian yelliow, maybe even a little of the bright red there. Ooh, I like a little more of that bright red. I like that"
Bob Ross,"Push though, you want that little ridge of paint, see it comin up there, push. Lets go right up here. You know what I wanna do"
Bob Ross,"I think Il just go in there and put a little branch or two, what the heck. I think we have time to do that"
Bob Ross,Maybe we can see just a few little sticks and twigs that are living in here and coming through. See. There
Bob Ross,Just sort of makes it a little more interesting when you see some of these little things that live deep in your trees and just brings it together cause there always there
Bob Ross,"Theres something thats holding all these leaves up, there we go. Now we can use that nice color we made"
Bob Ross,"Corner the brush, think about shape, and form, and how these little rascals would live in there, and jut begin working with them"
Bob Ross,"Now if you had trouble making the stick add the least little touch of paint thinner or liquid white. Now the liquid white will slightly change your color, of course, itll make it a little lighter"
Bob Ross,"So it just depends on what it is that you want, there. Think about shape and form. I know you get tired of hearing me say that but it is so important. It will make you happy when you get done"
Bob Ross,"Itll be worth the effort. There. Now then, over here on this other side, lets put a little something over there. Im gonna reach up and grab a little of the titanium white and add to that same color"
Bob Ross,"Now, over here I added the white because in my mind the light zinging through there and its gonna be a little bit brighter. See, gonna have those little spots on there that shine. There we go"
Bob Ross,Did you ever think you can do such delicate little things with a great big ol two inch brush
Bob Ross,"You can, you really can, in fact you can do anything that you believe you can do, anything and I know you can. There. Now then, tell you what lets do"
Bob Ross,"Im going back to my old brush here, let me find a brush, its got nothing but brown on it. This is the brown that we made from the sap green and the alizarin crimson"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna load some color in it, lets go up here, in my mind I wanna very dark tree right here, right there. There he is"
Bob Ross,"There, watch how this dark contrasting color push that first color back and itll stand out. Itll really stand out. There we go. Nice big ol happy tree lives right there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a big ol limb that hangs out here. There we go. This contrast is very pleasing. In fact, we may not do much more to that"
Bob Ross,I like that dark so well I may not even highlight it because in my mind this is gonna be way back in the shadows anyway
Bob Ross,Theres not gonna be a great deal of light coming through there and its a good way for me to keep the dark back there that I want. If you want to highlight it you certainly could
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little paint thinner with the same color and here and there just like we did before, add the indication that theres some limbs, and sticks, and stuff going on in here too"
Bob Ross,"We dont want this on left out but not a great deal. Shoot, maybe right in here is one thats a little lighter. As we mentioned earlier you have a lot of those in the woods"
Bob Ross,"There sort of pretty, they standout. Now then, back to our brush with a dark brown and we can come in here, and just begin tapping in some, maybe theres a little land area under here"
Bob Ross,"Grab that, pull it down too. Let me get a little sap green, and a little cad yellow, and make it very dark. Maybe even a little black in it, dull it down"
Bob Ross,Now theres brown on the brush and thats really gonna dull it also
Bob Ross,"All these colors are gonna dull it and in our world, maybe theres a little green grass that lives back here under this tree, just a little. There, nice place to sit"
Bob Ross,"Try to catch that big ol trout that lives out there, swims around all day. I like to fish, Im a pretty good ol fisherman"
Bob Ross,"But Im one these people that puts a bandaid onem, givesem a little CPR, pets him on the too-too, putsem back in the water"
Bob Ross,"Come back the next day and catch him again, cause the fun is in the catching of them. Little more of the brown. Maybe theres a little ledge right there, we dont know. Something like so"
Bob Ross,"Little brown and white, and we can put a little highlight on that, just a touch. We could use a fan brush with a little of that same green color"
Bob Ross,Just pop in some little areas so they come right down and bring that all together. There we go. Thought maybe today wed have some fun and wed make some rocks
Bob Ross,"So I want to take quite a bit of liquid white to put out here, just put it out here. Im gonna take then some dark sienna and mix it in there. I want a very thin paint"
Bob Ross,"This is dark sienna, liquid white, with the least little touch of yellow ochre. May even put a little van dyke brown in there, really dull it down, there. See there"
Bob Ross,"I wanna go right through the browns, both browns, van dyke and dark sienna, and Ill reach over here, both sides are covered, and Im gonna pull at one side through that thin paint so we have light"
Bob Ross,"color on one side, dark on the other. And in my world I see all kinds of happy little stones that live here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres just a whole group of little stones that live all down in here, wherever you wantem. Just sort of decide where they at and putem in"
Bob Ross,"The other side over here I wanna have some, something like that. There we go. And we dont know, shoot out in the water here there may be several more. Ran out of dark"
Bob Ross,"Just little things that live out here in the water. There. Now then, we can come right back. I want to have a little bit of land projecting right out through here, same ol dark color"
Bob Ross,"Little bit of reflection under it, little bit of the same color, and in yellow, cad yellow, little bit. And here there may be the least little touch of the bright red mixed in with it, just like so"
Bob Ross,"Now then, and I think there might be a few little stones down here too, maybe this one lives out here, just wherever you wantem, like so. And shoot, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,Maybe theres some little stones that live in here and you put a many or few stones in your world as you want. Little liquid white with a little of the blue in it and well come right in here
Bob Ross,Let this water just play right along through here. That sort of cleans up all these edges and brings it all together. And place some water all around these little stones that you laid in here
Bob Ross,"There, see. See, it just brings it all together. There. All right, now. Shoot, thats fantastic. Tell you what lets do. Im gonna take the contact paper off and lets see what we have"
Bob Ross,"Just grab it, pull it, and off we go. Isnt that a nice little painting. Now, you know me. I always like to put a big tree or two"
Bob Ross,"So Im gonna go right into that brown color that I made, use a fan brush, single brown color. And in my world, I think, all right theres your bravery test. There live a tree right there"
Bob Ross,"And hes got a friend. Dont makeem just straight, giveem some character. Letem move around and play in there. Our liner brush, paint thinner, and well put an arm or two on this tree"
Bob Ross,"There, if your paint doesnt flow it only means that you need more paint thinner. There we go. Maybe that limbs a little fatter. There. See"
Bob Ross,"And just put in all kinds of little limbs and doers and there we are. And this is up to you once again, you decide how many limbs are on your tree"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, you might wanna put some leaves or something on there, I dont know. Once again each person will see nature different. Each painting should be different and thats what makes it so much fun"
Bob Ross,"There we go. You just put in limb, after limb, after limb, many as you want or as few as you want"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, Ill tell you what, look here, heres one thats, groans you have to make your little noises see. It just sorta hangs off there like the wilderbrush, shoot"
Bob Ross,"Now we can take the knife, and you can take a little touch of brown and white, and heres our light source, and we can come in here, and just by touching, we can begin adding the illusion of bark"
Bob Ross,Thats what my puppy does barks bark. Thousand comedians that are working and me tryin to be one here. Okay. Something like so
Bob Ross,"And well come back with our brushes, cut a little of the yellow on it, put a little something something for around these trees foots to hold him in"
Bob Ross,"And I tell you what Im gonna take a little touch of the bright red, think well sign this one. Well sign him right out here on the rock. Well call it finished. Hope youve enjoyed this one"
Bob Ross,These little ovals are fantastic. Since we introduced them in several series back theyve become one of the most popular things we ever done. Artists all over the country are using this idea
Bob Ross,"So, try it, I think youll like it and from all of us here happy painting and God bless, my friend. lighthearted music"
Bob Ross,"Joy of Painting theme music smooth jazz electric guitar - Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today"
Bob Ross,"Think today, well just do a fantastic little painting thatll just make you happy. So, I tell you what"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen, that you need to paint along with us here. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got done up here"
Bob Ross,"Have my standard ol 18 x 24 inch pre-stretched, double-primed canvas, as we always use. I found some masking tape here in the studio, so I just sorta put that around like so"
Bob Ross,Took a can of spray paint and painted the edges. I thought wed just do something easy. Its a lot of fun. Something a little different. So lets do it. Lets start out with ol two-inch brush today
Bob Ross,"Well go right into a little Phthalo Blue, what the heck. Lets go into a little Phthalo Blue. We dont need much, its quite strong. Just a little. Just tap the bristles right in there"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here. Lets just build us a happy little sky today. As I say, its a fantastic day here. I hope it is wherever youre at. So I thought wed do a painting that just reflects that. There"
Bob Ross,Just using little criss-cross strokes. Lets just drop in a quick little sky. Ive chosen Phthalo Blue because its very similar to the color that we sprayed the canvas with
Bob Ross,"And you can do this in any color. It just happens to be what we had here, so thats what we used. There. Okay, and that easy, weve got a nice little sky"
Bob Ross,"Just blend it till its nice and soft, and its continually mixing with the Liquid White which is on the canvas. That way it gets softer and softer toward the horizon"
Bob Ross,"Thats exactly what were looking for today. All right, tell you what"
Bob Ross,"While we have that color on the brush, lets add a little more and Im gonna reach over here and get the least little touch of Phthalo Green"
Bob Ross,"Dont need much, just want enough just to flavor the blue a little. Just a tiny bit, okay. Now then, maybe well have a little water in here"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, if you painted with me before, you know that Im an absolute fanatic for water, I love it. There. Okay, little bit more color. Well come from the other side. Just like so. There"
Bob Ross,"And then very lightly and very gently, well just go across the entire water area here. That sorta blends it together and makes it nice and soft. Now, most fun part of all this is washing the brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets do that. Just shake it off. brush splashing and thwacking Bob laughing You can cover everybody in the room. All right, maybe in our world today. Maybe we have a little cloud"
Bob Ross,Maybe well use a fan brush today to make a little cloud. Just load both sides full of Titanium White. Lets go right up in here and decide where our little cloud lives
Bob Ross,"Maybe we have a little cloud in our world. That just sorta hangs around right here, like so. There he is. And Im using just the corner of the brush, making tight little circles"
Bob Ross,"Thats all were doing. Just very tight little circles. There. Now, Im gonna get a two-inch brush. Be sure its dry. And very gently, using just the corner again"
Bob Ross,"Just blend it, just blend the base of the cloud out. Then very gently, fluff it up a little bit. Do like that. That easy, you have a very effective little cloud"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, tell you what, maybe in our world, maybe theres several layers of clouds floating around up here. So well just have another one, right here. Right there"
Bob Ross,"When youre doing your painting, you put as many or as few clouds in it as you want. Up to you. brush banging Good clean, dry brush. Be sure your brush is dry"
Bob Ross,"If its got thinner in it, when you touch a cloud, its gonna get very thin and diluted and youre not gonna be able to blend it like this"
Bob Ross,"But you can put as many layers of these in as you want, just one after the other. See there. There we go. brush banging I always beat the brush, just to knock out any excess paint"
Bob Ross,"Because its continually picking up a little paint. So, just by beating it, you dont have to go through that entire cleaning procedure. There"
Bob Ross,"brush beating Maybe today in our world, we have, lets see. Tell you what, lets have a nice mountain in here. For that, I want to go in to some black. Well use a little of the blue"
Bob Ross,"We use a little Prussian Blue, Alizarin Crimson. Maybe even a little brown, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"knife tapping palette Just mix it up, pull it out as flat as you can get it and cut off a little roll of paint. That lives right out on the edge of your knife. Maybe our big mountain lives"
Bob Ross,"Where does it live. Maybe it comes right down here. I dont know, maybe it goes right on off the canvas. knife scraping on canvas Thats always sorta interesting"
Bob Ross,"When you hvae one that just sorta lives way up there in the sky. knife tapping palette Maybe, back in here. Wherever, wherever. Put another little one right there"
Bob Ross,"Just sorta let him float around in that direction. Just sorta make a decision and put it wherever you think it should be. Thats really all you have to do. There, now then"
Bob Ross,"With a clean, dry, two-inch brush, we wanna grab this and pull it. That does two things, two things. It removes excess paint, so the next layer sticks easier"
Bob Ross,"And it makes your mountain get lighter and lighter, toward the base. Thats exactly what were looking for. There we go, just blend it till it just sort of floats up there in the sky. There"
Bob Ross,"brush sweeping across canvas That easy, weve got our base color for a very nice little mountain. Lets take. Well use a little Titanium White today, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"Take a little white, also pull it out as flat as you can get it and go down, cut across, and get our little roll of paint. Its very important. Maybe well start right here"
Bob Ross,"You can play little games and have fun with this. No pressure. Absolutely no pressure with a knife. Youre just barely, barely touching it. Well take a little touch of"
Bob Ross,"Oh, well use a little touch of Phthalo Blue. Maybe a little touch of black in it. Make us a nice shadow color. Something like so. Okay, once again our little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"We go right up here, and decide where the shadows are. Theres one. Here comes one. soft wooshing sound Goes distinctly through that one. There. You can put shadows"
Bob Ross,"Just wherever you think the light would strike. Now, nice clean brush. I wanna just create the illusion of mist. Tap that, very gently. Very gently. Two hairs and some air"
Bob Ross,Sometimes its fun when youre doing mountains to play games with which ones in front and which ones in back. But make up little stories in your mind
Bob Ross,"Maybe this mountain lives right here and it comes, looky there, see. Distinctly in front. knife scraping canvas There we go"
Bob Ross,"Also, sometimes its very nice to have a little cloud that floats along and goes right in between those"
Bob Ross,"So, Im going to add the least little touch of Liquid White to the paint, right on the fan brush. The Liquid Whites to make it a little thinner"
Bob Ross,"Because a thin paint will stick right up here without messin everything up. We can put a happy little cloud, that lives right in here, between these two. Clean, dry brush. Very gently"
Bob Ross,"Float it a little bit, there. Thatll give us the impression that theres a little cloud up there, and we can bring this right on distinctly through. Okay. Now then, back to my Titanium White"
Bob Ross,"Lets begin putting some highlights on this mountain over here. No pressure, absolutely no pressure. The most gentle touch. Just float right through here. soft zooming sound Absolutely no pressure"
Bob Ross,"Lets go to this big one here. soft whooshing sound knife scraping and tapping Here it comes, right there. Your paint has to be very firm. Very firm, or you wont get this breaking"
Bob Ross,"And this breaking is what makes your mountains so pretty. There. Just begin working it. Let it go. Just let it go. On the other side, were gonna have shadows coming right down through here"
Bob Ross,"No pressure though, once again. soft zooming sound Gotta make those little noises, or it doesnt work right. knife scraping and tapping There. Now, you can continue to work back and forth"
Bob Ross,Maybe we wanna put some nice bumps and ridges out here on this mountain. There they come. Just sorta let your imagination be your guide here. There. Back to our shadow color
Bob Ross,"Because every time you have a little projection out here, you need a shadow behind it. It needs its own, distinct shadow"
Bob Ross,"Here and there you can touch a dark base color a little bit, just let a little of that flow right down. Just play games with light and dark. Thats whatll make your mountains so fantastic"
Bob Ross,"There, wherever you think these little things should be. knife tapping palette Little bit of our shadow color here and there. Right in there"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, were gonna mess around and have us a mountain here. brush banging Okay, lets just tap now. We wanna create the illusion of mist down at the base of this big ol mountain"
Bob Ross,"Tap and then we lift upward. Following the angles in the mountain. All this does is remove the tap marks and blends everything together. Just blends it together. Over here, youll follow these angles"
Bob Ross,"Its most important though, that you follow these angles. There. Right in here. Sometimes, its a lot of fun just to play some games. Watch here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, theres another little mountain that lives right there. Put a little dark in and this is a way of creating the illusion of distance"
Bob Ross,"In your painting, when you have layer after layer of these things. Scrape off the excess. We go back to our Titanium White. Put a little highlight right here on this one too"
Bob Ross,"zooming sound Just let him go. No pressure, I cant say that enough times. I say it over and over because this is one of the major problem areas that I hear in letters and stuff"
Bob Ross,"Hard time making the paint break. The reason normally is, either one of two things. Too much pressure, or the paint is too thin. Mix up a little more shadow color here, ran out"
Bob Ross,"Then we can put us a little shadow, right in there. See how you can move things around. You have unlimited power on this canvas. Can literally, literally move mountains"
Bob Ross,"Now, once again, lets grab that, tap a little bit. Create that misty illusion. brush tapping canvas Okay, then just blend it, like so"
Bob Ross,"We can take a little bit of that shadow color on the brush, maybe, shoot. Maybe theres a little foothill that lives right here. Just using the corner of the brush. Maybe theres a little foothill"
Bob Ross,"But all these different planes, create the illusion of distance. And, watch here, watch here. Sometimes you can even get a little crazy and watch"
Bob Ross,See how itll push that foothill back and bring that mountain forward. Isnt that fantastic. And you can do that. brush tapping vigorously You can do that. Blend it
Bob Ross,"Now you have a foothill behind the mountain. That easy though, you can change your mind. Push mountains around and move rivers. Whatever you wanna do. Okay. Tell you what, wipe off the old knife"
Bob Ross,"Lets mix up a little bit of lavender color here. For that, well use a little Phthalo Blue and Alizarin Crimson, proportionately much, much more crimson than blue. Well make a nice lavender"
Bob Ross,"If you wanna see what color your lavender is, take a little white, and mix some color with it. Because you cant tell, that just looks black. So put a little color there. Thats just right"
Bob Ross,"Let me clean off my knife. Well grab us a fan brush. Tell you what, lets go right into a little of that. Ill pick up some white, there. Just make sort of a nice lavender color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe even a little more of the crimson. Oh, I like it better. But just mix this till its the right flavor. There, and maybe back here in our world"
Bob Ross,"Yeah, theres some little evergreens that live back here, some little trees that are far away. Just little doers. There"
Bob Ross,"Now if you have trouble making your paint stick, over the top of this other, add the least, least little touch of paint thinner. But it takes very, very little. Very little, dont get carried away"
Bob Ross,"Its easy to overdo. Maybe a few of these trees back here, maybe theyre a little bigger. You can make out detail on em. There. Give him a little friend. brush scrubbing canvas There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Im gonna take two-inch brush and I want to create the illusion of mist at the base. Just by tapping with the top corner, we can do that. Want it to be very soft and hazy"
Bob Ross,"Very misty back there. Just let that sorta go on off into nothing. But look at all the different layers in here. brush scrubbing vigorously Okay good, life gently upward"
Bob Ross,"And just blend it out, down on the bottom. There. All right, time to have some fun. Lets mix us up some color here. We just take a bunch of dark colors"
Bob Ross,"Well use black, Prussian Blue, some brown, some crimson, maybe well take that Phthalo Green that was left and throw it in there too. There we go. Maybe even a little Sap Green"
Bob Ross,"I want it to have a little greenish tone to it. But you might as well mix up a pretty good pile of paint. Pretty good pile of paint. Shoot, Ill just use that same ol fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Thats workin pretty good there. Well load it full of color. A lot of paint on both sides. Now, we have to make some big decisions in our world"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a nice evergreen tree, lives right there. Im gonna dip the brush into the least little bit of thinner, so itll stick easier. Cause were going over several layers of paint now"
Bob Ross,"So we really need the paint to be a little thinner, so itll stick. Im pushing upward with the brush. Just to make a little evergreen right there"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, that worked so well, lets have another little evergreen. Just push gently upward with the brush. All you have to do. There. And you make a decision, how many trees live in your world"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres one there. I dont know, one there. This is an excellent way to practice your little trees. Make a few of them, what the heck. Well put one way over here. Make a few of em"
Bob Ross,"There he goes. Well just, while we got this old fan brush running here, well just push in a little bit of dark color, like so. There. Tell you what, lets grab the two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"I want some reflections under that. So all you have to do, since the canvas is wet with the Liquid White, is grab that and pull it straight down. Pull it down, isnt that sneaky"
Bob Ross,"Then go across, and we have instant reflections. Maybe theres a little projection comes right out here. Something like so. In your world, you make the decisions"
Bob Ross,Where you want all these little things to live. Just put them in. All were doing is laying down a dark base color so we can come back and put a few highlights on there
Bob Ross,"Okay, now I need a little reflection under that. Each time you do a little peninsula of land, you need a little reflection under it. Or, when your paintings done, itll look just like its floating"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, while we got that ol brush running, lets go on the other side and give it a tree, We dont want it left out. Maybe this tree lives up there. Maybe it goes right on off the canvas"
Bob Ross,"We dont know. Push upward though. Think about little individual limbs that live in this big tree. There we are, there. Just drop em in. I like to do these evergreen trees. Theyre so nice"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right on down to about like there. Wherever. Well give him a little friend too. Well be painting a whole forest here, in just a matter of a few minutes. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, maybe right out here. There we are, lets do somethin like so. Just let your imagination go. Look at your painting. Everybodys painting is gonna look a little different"
Bob Ross,"Look at it, you may have things that are better, that you dont wanna mess up. Dont change it just because I did. Gently across. brush beating Now then"
Bob Ross,"Take a little white, little Dark Sienna, mix it together, and lets put the indication here and there of a little tree trunk in some of these things. Just touch, wont be much showin way back here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres one right here. We dont want him left out. And then on our old big tree. Thats a big one, see more of it. There, Im gonna grab another fan brush"
Bob Ross,"I have several of each brush going, so I dont have to spend all my time just washing brushes"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little yellow and Ill take a little of that color we made the tree out of, mix it together, it has blue in it. So automatically, its gonna turn a beautiful green. There"
Bob Ross,Just get it to whatever flavor you want it. Lets go back in here. Lights coming from the right. Lets begin putting in little things like this. Just a few little highlights
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put a lot of highlights in these trees. Tell you what, you know I travel all over the country. I meet a lot of exciting people"
Bob Ross,"As you know, Im absolutely crazy about little creatures and stuff. Recently, I had the opportunity to meet a fantastic lady, by the name of Carmen Shaw"
Bob Ross,"She lives in Orlando and we filmed a little bit of footage with her, and Id like to share some of that with you. This is Carmen, feeding one of her little pets. This is a little possum"
Bob Ross,Isnt this the cutest little devil. Hes just very young. Carmen takes care of animals that have been orphaned. Or theyve been injured and she patches em up
Bob Ross,She devotes her whole life to taking care of these little creatures. These kind of people are absolutely wonderful and theyre necessary if were gonna preserve some of these creatures
Bob Ross,I want you to watch how she feeds this little possum. Hes a hungry little dude. There. I just get to go and enjoy him. She has to do the taking care of it though
Bob Ross,"Looky there, think that rascals not hungry. Bob laughing Hes something else. I got to spend several hours with Carmen. She shared with me quite a few animals that she has over there"
Bob Ross,"She has everything from cranes to hawks and owls, just a multitude of animals that have been injured or hurt. She does all of this on her own. I think thats fantastic"
Bob Ross,"In amongst all of her little creatures she has deer and foxes and raccoons, etc. She has a little fox named Major. Which is one of the cutest little creatures Gods ever made"
Bob Ross,"Major has been hurt, somebody even cut his tail off. But she allowed me to go in the cage with him. Show a little bit of that here in just a second"
Bob Ross,"All were doing here is just dropping in some highlights. There, okay. Just pushing upward with this brush, like so. The little fox, as I say, his name was Major. Hes absolutely precious"
Bob Ross,"He thinks hes a puppy. That son of a gun is just about as tame as he can be. I got up all my nerve and got in the cage with him there. As you can see, we made friends very quickly"
Bob Ross,"And we had a very good time together. While youre watching that, Im just going to put in a little water line right here. This little devil was fascinated with my hair"
Bob Ross,"Of course, I guess he thought it was steel wool. Maybe it was time to clean the dishes or something, I dont know. But he was fascinated with my hair. He tried to eat my hair off"
Bob Ross,Only thing Im doing here while youre watching that is just putting in a few little water lines here and there. Just with a little touch of the Liquid White. But isnt this little fox just beautiful
Bob Ross,Just fell in love with him. His name is Major. There. Okay. Bob laughing I spent about an hour in the cage with this rascal and we just had a heck of a time together
Bob Ross,"While you were watching that, I just put in a few little water lines using Liquid White on the knife. Now then, Im gonna take. Lets have some fun, shoot. Put out a bunch of Liquid White here"
Bob Ross,"Wipe my hand off there. And with that, Im gonna put a little Dark Sienna into it. Hittin my hand with the paint"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit of the Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna, and Im gonna go right through this thin color that Ive made. And maybe up here, theres just a few little stones that live in here"
Bob Ross,"All you do is take the side of this filbert brush and just do like so, wherever you want these little stones to live, just go like that, see. You can put as few or as many in here as you want"
Bob Ross,There they go. Its sort of neat when you want a little stone here and there. Theres one even back here
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take here a little bit of the Liquid White on the knife and just sorta go around these stones, that helps set em right down into the water"
Bob Ross,"We can take a fan brush, little Liquid White on it. Least little touch of Phthalo Blue. Lets just go in here, and just begin putting in all kinds of little water things that live around these stones"
Bob Ross,"There. Just let it work right on back, like so. Hope you enjoy seeing these little animals. They are so precious and I love to show em to you and share em with you"
Bob Ross,"Cause these little critters are my friends. I spend a lot of time with em and I enjoy meeting people like Carmen, and the bird lady we bring here in Muncie and everything"
Bob Ross,"These are special people to me. Okay, tell you what, lets come right up here. Let me pull this tape off, and lets see what weve got today"
Bob Ross,"tape peeling This is just plain ol masking tape that anybody can pick up. And when you take that off, it almost looks like the picture is matted. Its a very nice little effect"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little red, liner brush. Lets sign this one. Right about here. I think well call it finished. I hope you try this little painting. Its very nice and youll enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Im certainly glad you could join me today. I thought today wed just do a fantastic little seascape. Ill show you how easy you can do one of those"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got done"
Bob Ross,"Have my regular old canvas up here, except today Ive covered the bottom part of it here and up the side, with Black Gesso. And Ive allowed that to dry completely"
Bob Ross,"And after its dry, be sure its dry, it takes about 30 - 40 minutes for it to dry. And its totally different now than Liquid Black. This is Black Gesso, which is an acrylic"
Bob Ross,Then weve taken transparent color. Ive put a little Alizarin Crimson and Dark Sienna mixture in here. And a little Sap Green and brown down in here. Down here is just a little brown
Bob Ross,"The white part weve covered, as usual, with Liquid White. So its completely wet and ready to go. So lets just have some fun today. Im gonna start out with the old two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,Well go into the least little touch of the Indian Yellow. Just a small amount. And well go right up here. And lets just dance in a happy little sky today
Bob Ross,"Lets do a seascape thats very bright and shiny and pretty. There we go, little Cad Yellow. Vary the yellows here. Started with Indian Yellow, now were into Cad Yellow"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, now Im gonna go into a little bit of Yellow Ochre. And Yellow Ochres sort of a gold color, its very pretty. Very pretty color, I like it"
Bob Ross,"We just let it come right on around, maybe something like that. Wherever, just make some decisions. Then well take a little of the Bright Red and we have not cleaned the brush yet"
Bob Ross,"I like these kind of paintings where I dont have to clean the brush much, Im sort of a lazy painter. There"
Bob Ross,"But by allowing these colors to blend on the brush and on the canvas, you get a multitude of different values and colors, rather than just one old flat color. Shoot, put some excitement in your world"
Bob Ross,"There we go. I tell you what, lets just paint it all the way down here to the water line. This is just a little piece of masking tape I have across here. Just to keep the water line straight. There"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes my hands a little shaky, so I need all the help I can get. So we just use a little piece of masking tape. You dont have to have that there, if you dont want it"
Bob Ross,"Just makes it a little easier. Gently, gently blend all these together. Maybe Ill put a little of that color on the brush up here too, just to fill in the sky. Just blend it all together"
Bob Ross,"So you cant tell where one color stops and the next color starts. There we go. And you can make this brighter or duller, whatever. brush rubbing across the canvas Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, let me grab another brush. I have several brushes going, so I dont have to spend all my time washing them. Im gonna go right into a little Titanium White. Pure Titanium White"
Bob Ross,"Right up here, Im gonna put a little of this white. I wanna make a bright spot in this sky. It wont look all that bright at this point, but it will when we get a little further along. There"
Bob Ross,"brush sweeping across canvas Just really give a nice sparkle up here. Okay. Maybe, maybe. I didnt realize how much I said that, till a little boy one day, about ten years old, began mocking me"
Bob Ross,"He was walking around saying, Maybe, maybe, maybe.  Bob snickers All right, Im gonna make up a little lavender color here, using Alizarin Crimson and Phthalo Blue"
Bob Ross,"Much, much more crimson than blue. Something like so. Let me clean off the old knife. And heres a dirty brush, well just use that. Has a little of that sky color on it"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna tap the bristles into that. brush tapping on palette Just tap a little bit, like so"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here and lets make some nice little clouds that just float around and have fun all day. Just sorta wind em up and put em in there, see. There. Okay. Wherever you think they should be"
Bob Ross,"brush swishing on canvas Im gonna just have em come right over here. This is gonna be a big cliff, I think. A big rocky thing lives right there. Just drop it in. All right, there we go"
Bob Ross,"And by using these little twisting or circular patterns here, it creates a multitude of little things happening up here. Its not just a flat ol dead sky. Lot of nice things going on. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well come right over in here. And Im just gonna put clouds all over the sky like this. Okay, there we are. Maybe it comes right down. Just load a little more color. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little protrusion right out here. Wherever you want em. There. I tell you what, while Im doing this, because this is going to take just a second"
Bob Ross,I wanna show you one of my little characters thats living with me now. I have three little baby squirrels that Im raising and they are they cutest little devils
Bob Ross,"We took a little video of em, and I wanna share that with you while Im doing this. And I wont do anything I dont tell you about while thats coming on there. Now these are tiny little baby ones"
Bob Ross,"Theyre just beginning to get a little fur. Ive had them now since just after their eyes opened. These little rascals are hungry continually. So, I thought Id show you how we feed em"
Bob Ross,"To do that, we take. I just use a little syringe, with a little nipple on the end of it. Its just like goin to the doctor and gettin your shot when its feeding time here"
Bob Ross,"We filler up and normally though, when you see a syringe comin at you, sorta scares you a little bit, but in this case, when my little friends here see a syringe coming at em, they get excited"
Bob Ross,"This just makes their whole day. Its hard to get em to eat, as you can see. Bob laughing I think theyll eat about every 15 minutes, if youd feed em"
Bob Ross,"I have three of those little rascals now and they live with me, and my mother and I, and Nancy, we all take care of these little devils. Theyre gonna soon be big enough to turn loose and let em go"
Bob Ross,"There. Im just putting in a few little clouds down here, while you was watching the little squirrels. Still just using the corner of the brush and just making little circular patterns"
Bob Ross,"Just round and around and around we go. Just sorta stir it up. Just stir it up, is all were trying to do at this point. But we dont want a lot of paint on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"All were looking for is a little stain. There. Sometimes you can just decide where it should be a little darker, a little lighter"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, maybe theres even a little projection that comes right out through there. See, that easy. Just by tapping. You can make all those little things. Okay. Grabbing another clean brush"
Bob Ross,"This is clean, has nothing on it. Its very dry. And with that, you can just begin blending this now. To any degree of softness or harshness that you want. Just blend it"
Bob Ross,Arent those little squirrels cute. I really like those little devils. Theyre so much fun
Bob Ross,"You spend a little time with one of these, and it certainly makes you appreciate nature and all of Gods wisdom when He created these little characters. You get addicted to em"
Bob Ross,"Especially my young friends. I have a lot of children that live around where I live, and I let em come over and help me feed the little squirrels and look at em, and hold em"
Bob Ross,I think everybody should have the opportunity to make friends with a little guy like that
Bob Ross,"If you do, youll certainly have a greater appreciation of nature and all the little things that are runnin around that we dont pay a lot of attention to. There we go. Now then"
Bob Ross,"brush banging Just knockin off the excess paint. Very gently, very gently, we can just blend that. But isnt that a fantastic way of making a sky thats"
Bob Ross,"soft delighted exclamation Sun gonna jump out and get you. And you can do that. brush banging All right, time to wash your brush. And as you now, we wash our brushes just with odorless thinner"
Bob Ross,"banging brush Bob laughing Just beat the devil out of em. Maybe Ill wash two, I dirtied up several while we were doing that. brush slapping and banging Thats double your pleasure"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now the little piece of masking tape right here. Lets take it off. masking tape peeling See, now that leaves you with a very straight, smooth horizon"
Bob Ross,"But there was no color under that, so Ill take a little bit of the crimson and little Dark Sienna"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna, probably this wont even show up, but Im just scrubbing a little transparent color on there. Just bringin that all together. This is just the crimson and a little Dark Sienna"
Bob Ross,"There, right up to the water line. Okay, just sorta blend it together. brush sweeping across the canvas All right. Now then, we have to make some big major decisions here"
Bob Ross,"You know me, I like to have these big crashing waves"
Bob Ross,"I dont like just doing these little subdued waves, but if you like those, you can do those the same way as we do the little waves in the back, very simply"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, in our world, our waves gonna live right here. You can take a fan brush or filbert brush and just make sort of a little outline of. swooshing sound There"
Bob Ross,"Thats gonna be our wave, right there. Now then, with a little touch of the Titanium White, and Im using a number three fan brush. Im gonna go right up here to the horizon and just begin"
Bob Ross,"Come up close right here. Im just making strokes where Im going like this. Im really exaggerating, but like that. Im exaggerating, but it looks like little watery things back here. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now thats one of the nicest, easiest, simplest little ways that Ive ever found just to make the indication of water back in there"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add the least little touch of Cad Yellow to my color right in here. Oh, thats nice. Thats beginning to sparkle. Little bit more. See it looks like light, just shining right across there"
Bob Ross,"There we go. This is just some background material. Now then, let me wash the old brush. paint thinner splashing brush tapping and wiping dry Now the fun part, right in here"
Bob Ross,"Thats the eye of the wave. Well just take some Titanium White and just, as my son Steve says, Just mush it in there.  Really push it in there hard. You can do this several times"
Bob Ross,"If it gets like theres a lot of color underneath, remove that excess paint and that remains there. That color remains there"
Bob Ross,"We can take a little more of our white, add a little of the Cad Yellow to that. Go right back in here, see there. Each time you do that itll get lighter in value"
Bob Ross,"Or you can take a rag or something and just wipe that out. Whichever way youd like to do it. Maybe it comes right on back, like so. Just scrub it in. Now then"
Bob Ross,"brush banging Clean, dry, two-inch brush. Im only gonna use the top corner and you put it there and you just sort of wind it up, just wiggle it. There. You can make this as smooth as silk"
Bob Ross,So smooth. But theres not a lot of movement. Youre sorta just going around in little tight circles. There we go. Then begin thinking about how you want your water to flow
Bob Ross,"brush sweeping across canvas There. brush banging Knock off that excess paint. Thats an easy way of just about getting your brush clean, without going through that whole procedure"
Bob Ross,"brush scrubbing canvas There. Okay. Let me find a fan brush here, got several of them going. Maybe, in our world, we want to have this water crashing over something"
Bob Ross,"Grab it and pull, think about the angle though. Angles are very important. Very important. Think about that water. makes wave sound, laughs Make those little noises. That really helps. There"
Bob Ross,"Just think about it crashing over. Thats all that we need at this point. Now, if you want to bring some of that dark back with a clean brush, you can just grab it and lift it upward"
Bob Ross,"Thatll very gently blend it all together. See there. You can work back and forth, until you get it exactly the way that you want it. Okay, let me go back and get my little number three fan brush"
Bob Ross,"I like this little fan brush. Its good for makin little foamy things, and stuff like that. Take a little white and then Im going into that nice lavender color we used in the sky"
Bob Ross,"Make sort of a medium value lavender. Okay, lets go back up in here. Now then, lets start thinking about having some nice foam out here"
Bob Ross,"Just using the corner of the fan brush, and once again, you can do this with a filbert, just as well. The little number six filbert brush would work just as well"
Bob Ross,"I just happened to have this, so well use it. All were doing here is putting in some shadows. Some nice dark areas for the foam"
Bob Ross,"Think about the water churning and bubbling and splashing and carrying on. makes wave noise Crashing. Maybe it comes right over here, I dont know. Wherever you want it"
Bob Ross,"Okay, Im gonna wash that old brush. paint thinner splashing I like to do seascapes. Theyre a lot of fun and theyll force you to study water and how it moves and churns, and etc. Go to the ocean"
Bob Ross,"Or get a video, or photographs of water, just study. If you dont live near the ocean, then look in books and videos and stuff like that, and you can see all of this"
Bob Ross,"Now, Ive got just Titanium White and Im going right up here on top of this darker color. Just gonna take the fan brush here and scrub in a little highlight"
Bob Ross,"Wipe the brush off when you load it, so you have nice, clean color. There. Just wipe it on a paper towel in between. Think about that water, hittin and splashin and churning"
Bob Ross,"Make up little stories and sounds in your mind and just let it happen. Let it happen. There. brush scrubbing Now then, back to our large brush"
Bob Ross,"brush banging I use the large brush, only because it seems to have a little more hair in it, and it blends better. You could do this with a one-inch brush, if you would like"
Bob Ross,"Im sort of hung up on this ol big brush, but try em both. See which one works the best for you. Thats the one you are to use. Maybe over here, a little bit right in here too"
Bob Ross,"Just that nice churning. Maybe theres even a little, splashin down like that. Whatever. There. That ol water is comin down through here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add the least little touch of Phthalo Blue into that color. I want a little bluish. oh, thats nice. That is nice, I like that. Begin thinking about how your water is coming up"
Bob Ross,"Right up in this transparency, or the eye. Just Phthalo Blue and white, once again. There. Maybe it comes down here and. wave noise Think about shape though. Maybe theres a nice"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, maybe theres something right here. Let that water come up and fall over. Were creating a trough or a valley in here. Okay, here it comes. There. Just wherever"
Bob Ross,brush scrubbing canvas Little bit more of the Phthalo Blue and white. There. Just let that splash and curl. makes splashing sound Big things comin down through here
Bob Ross,"This is what gives shape and form to your wave. I tell you, maybe, even in here, lets just use the corner of the brush. Maybe the waters splashing, crashing right along in here"
Bob Ross,"There may be another little splasher in there. Who knows. This is your world, so you can do anything that you want to do. Anything that you want to do. Let me take a large brush"
Bob Ross,"and just sort of blend that together. Were beginning to get into little bit of that Sap Green and Van Dyke Brown stuff thats down here. All right, let me get the liner brush out"
Bob Ross,"I like that little liner brush. Well take that. I wanna go into a little bit of that same lavender color that had a little white in it, same color we have up here"
Bob Ross,"Lets just sorta highlight this edge here, with a little color. Make it nice and firm. Then begin putting in some little shapes"
Bob Ross,"Just some little doers in there that create all the little shapes and stuff that you want in here. Paint thinner with a little color, is all I have here. Use a little of that blue and white in here"
Bob Ross,"This is where you can begin putting in all kinds of little details. At home you have unlimited time. You can really set and make beautiful little things in there, put all those little details"
Bob Ross,"While Ive got that going, maybe back in here you can see all these little doers. Little Titanium White with paint thinner on it. Highlight some of the brighter ones, where you think light would hit"
Bob Ross,"There. As I say, these little details is what really will make your seascape spectacular. Now then. Okay. Reach down here, get a little touch more of that paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Just let some of these little things wiggle and jiggle and your hand shake. Ive had people write and tell me they had a little nervous twitch in their hand, they had a hard time painting"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes, thats a very valuable asset. Use it to your advantage. There. Tell you what. Lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Now, this big ledge up here, Ive already covered that with a little bit of brown, as I mentioned earlier. Lets take a little Dark Sienna, grab a little white, Alizarin Crimson"
Bob Ross,"Just sorta mix those loosely. Im just gonna mix em on a brush. Maybe even a little touch of the Yellow Ochre. Not much, just a little. Okay, just on the fan brush. Lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Lets begin thinking about shapes here. All you have to do is just tap. Take the fan brush and tap. Thats really all it amounts to. And you can begin forming your rocks. Just by tapping, just tap"
Bob Ross,In here and there you can add a little light color. Wherever you think light would strike and bounce and play. There. Leave some dark areas in here. Dark areas will end up being big holes in the rocks
Bob Ross,"Little place for the seagulls to go. They gotta have a place to build a nest. In Alaska, we have little puffins. Theyre one of the cutest little birds Gods ever made"
Bob Ross,"Looks like their beaks too big for their head. Beautiful little birds. There. But just form these, just like so. And you could do this with a knife"
Bob Ross,"I just want to show you several different ways of doing it. But the knife will work very well for making very nice rock effects. There, try to stand out of the way so you can see there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this comes right on down into here somewhere, like so. I got several fan brushes going, let me get another one here. I want a rock on the other side too. Right there"
Bob Ross,"whooshing sound I bet you knew I was going to put a rock there, didnt you. I always like big rocks, big trees in my paintings"
Bob Ross,"Just sorta decide how you think that old rock should live in there, and drop it in"
Bob Ross,"We can take some of that color, come right along in here, and once again, this is a nice way of outlining and forming your stones and rocks. There"
Bob Ross,"brush tapping canvas I want this one to remain quite dark. Quite dark, so it doesnt distract too much. There we go. Now you can take a clean, dry, two-inch brush and very gently, just caress it"
Bob Ross,"Just caress it. Itll blend all that together. Make it nice and smooth, and it looks like beautiful stones then. But very, very gently. One hair and some air. There"
Bob Ross,"Little bit of our Phthalo Blue and white. Well have a little splash, comin round down through here. makes soft splashing sound Shoot, maybe theres even a little water drippin down"
Bob Ross,"You could do this with a liner brush or the fan brush. Just whatever. Maybe theres even a. makes wave sound Right there. Look at there, let that come right on back, like so"
Bob Ross,"See, just bring it all together. Then a little bit in the foreground. These seascapes are not near as hard as they look. You really can do these. Maybe, lets get crazy"
Bob Ross,"We have a second cleft here, so well put a little stone right here too. I just like to have stones all out in the water. I like it, it just enhances my paintings"
Bob Ross,"Little bit of the nice highlight color. Lets see here, we could take the liner brush, little of that Phthalo Blue and white, and paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Thin it down and you can literally have water dripping, right off these rocks, just like so. Let some of this just. makes wave sound Put all these little things in"
Bob Ross,"Its a super way though, of making very effective little seascapes like this. There. Okay, little bit right in there"
Bob Ross,"Just make decisions, where you think the water would be churnin and splashin, maybe all around this rock. Just using the corner of the fan brush though. Thats all were using"
Bob Ross,"All back in here there would be. Well have some churning back against that big rock. Little misty areas, like so. And you can just keep on and on and on. But there comes a time when we have to stop"
Bob Ross,"I tell you what, well just take a touch, a little touch of dark color. Well put one little lonely bird up here. Little m bird. And I think with that, well call this ol painting finished"
Bob Ross,"Hope this gives you an idea of how to do a fantastic seascape at home. If you give it a try, you will love it. And Id love to see some photographs of what youre doing"
Bob Ross,"If you have time, drop us a line. Let us know if you like the show. Send us some pictures of what youre doing. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today. Its a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever youre at"
Bob Ross,Lets start out then and have them run all of the colors across the screen that youll need to paint along with us
Bob Ross,"And I thought today wed do the little opening painting that you see that Jerry Morton put together thats so fantastic. So, tell you what Ive got going up here"
Bob Ross,"Got my standard old 18 x 24 inch canvas and its covered with a thin even coat of the Liquid White and its already to go. So, lets go"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out today with a little touch of the bright red, just a little. Dont need much. Its a very strong color. Just a little. Okay, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"And lets just go right in here, just using our little criss-cross strokes and well just lay in a happy little sky, just like so, a little more color"
Bob Ross,"And Ive started at the horizon and working up today. I want to get lighter and lighter toward the top. There, okay. But just use little Xs, little Xs like so. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe a little more over in this corner here. Dont want it left out. And thats about all we need right now"
Bob Ross,"Lets have a little of that pink right down here in whats going to end up being water. And for that, well just use nice horizontal stokes. There we are"
Bob Ross,"That little opening that you see, it only takes a few minutes to paint the painting, but it takes a lot of fantastic people a very long time to put it together. And really proud of them"
Bob Ross,"Theyve done a beautiful job. And we call that little character the little painter man. Hm, the little painter man, I like that in his little painter suit"
Bob Ross,"And if you like that, you ought to drop us a line and let us know. Maybe we can do some other things with that little character. There, all right"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Im going to reach right up here, use the same old dirty brush, get a little touch of the Van Dyke brown and mix a little dark sienna with it. What the heck"
Bob Ross,"Dont need a lot of color though, just a little. Lets go right up here. Now up in here, we want the indication of just a happy little cloud thats floating around in the sky"
Bob Ross,"And when youre doing this, Im exaggerating, but make strokes like that. It makes all those little things happen in there. There. Just wherever you want it, wherever"
Bob Ross,"Right there was a little doer that hung down, something like that. Okay, a little more of the color and over in here, wherever, wherever"
Bob Ross,"You can even tap in some little stringy ones if you want them, there"
Bob Ross,"Now, sometimes its fun to take a little white, just a little of the titanium white, pure old white and go right up in here and put in a nice light bright area"
Bob Ross,"Ir really makes the painting sparkle up here. There, puts one, just one nice spot. Makes you feel good when you look up at that. All right. And thats about all we had in that little sky. That simple"
Bob Ross,"There. brush strokes canvas Okay, and just sort of blend this out while you have a nice clean brush and were in business. Now then, lets build us a little mountain in here"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets mix up, Im going to use some alizarin crimson and sap green in about equal proportions, about equal"
Bob Ross,"Now you can mix this to the green side or to the redish side, just depending on what kind of effect that you want. You can change the flavor either way. But mix it quite thoroughly. There, all right"
Bob Ross,"Let me clean off the old knife here. Now, lets build us a little mountain. Well take a little bit of that color and come right up in here"
Bob Ross,"Decide where your big mountain is going to live and using very firm pressure, very firm, just come right along here, right along, right a long"
Bob Ross,"Decide where your mountains going to live and begin dropping it in, just begin dropping it in. Over here we need a little bump. I think there would be one there, and we can do that that easy"
Bob Ross,"And really really push that paint right into the fabric. You can probably hear how hard Im scraping and pushing, there"
Bob Ross,That makes the application of the next layer much easier if theres not much paint on the canvas here
Bob Ross,"Now then, well take a two-inch brush and we pull that because because theres Liquid White on there, you can literally move this paint all over the canvas if you want to. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And by watching the brush strokes, its nice way of laying out a lot of your highlights and shadows in mountains when youre doing them"
Bob Ross,"It may not show too much here, but when youre painting, youll understand exactly what Im saying. You can see every little brush stroke. And well just blend that right off to nothing, like that"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take, lets take lets take a little bright red, a little titanium white and were going to mix it together and I want just a light pinkish glow in my white"
Bob Ross,"I dont want to set the world on fire right here. Pull it out as flat as we can get it. Takes very little of that bright red. All right, and we go in and cut off a little roll of paint. There it is"
Bob Ross,"Now this will not be an exact duplicate of the painting that you saw at the beginning because its almost impossible to paint another painting thats identical, but it will give you a good idea of how"
Bob Ross,"this one was made. Yeah, here we are. I like that little painter guy though. Its really, really cute"
Bob Ross,"It took nearly a full day to make that one little opening, but we had a lot of fun with it and did a lot of crazies and its really, the outtakes would be even cuter sometimes than what you see here"
Bob Ross,"There. Okay, tell you what, Im going to take a little white, put a little touch of the phthalo blue into it, just a little, dont need much"
Bob Ross,"And reach over here and grab a little black and a little touch of crimson, just to dull it, just want to dull it down. There, thats nice. Let me clean the knife off"
Bob Ross,i clean the knife only so it shows up a little better how were loading it. When we come right in here and you can see that nice close up
Bob Ross,"See, that little ridge of paint, little roll of paint right on the edge is so important"
Bob Ross,"If you get in the habit of loading the knife that way, it will save you a lot of agony, make things work much better for you"
Bob Ross,"Now, well just come right along here, put in little shadows, very delicate, caressing the canvas, barely touching, barely barely touching, barely touching. Mm, this is such a gentle touch"
Bob Ross,"Just gentle, gentle, gentle. There. Over here, we need some right there. Dont want that one left out. Okay, once again though, just barely barely touching the canvas"
Bob Ross,"And you can come back and now we can begin adding all those little special things, little nooks and crannies. Little mountain goats got to have a place to live too, you know"
Bob Ross,"So, give him maybe a little place to have him a little house. He wants to live up here where hes safe and no body bothers him. Think thats what we all want"
Bob Ross,"We want a place to live where were safe and so does that little mountain goat. See, when youre making a mountain, think about him. Shoot, might find out you like the little guy. There we go"
Bob Ross,But just sort of look at your painting and each ones going to be different and you can bring all of these little things together and make up little valleys and hills and bumps and crevasses and all
Bob Ross,"those things that you want in your painting. There. And each and every painting will be different and unique, one of a kind, and thats what makes it fun"
Bob Ross,"Its really what makes it fun is individuality. There. Okay, here and there. And take just the least little touch of crimson and blue. It makes sort of a lavender color"
Bob Ross,"Least little touch, mostly crimson though. And you put the indication here and there of some little dark areas. Im using the small edge of the knife or you could just use a small knife. There"
Bob Ross,"Straighten up your edges the way you want them. Shoot, youre in business. Okay, take a clean very dry brush and just going to tap this, being very sure to follow the angles and lift upward"
Bob Ross,"Always follow those angles, most most important. Otherwise youll destroy everything that youve done. We dont want to destroy. We only want to diffuse. Thats all we want to do is just diffuse"
Bob Ross,"You can grab a little touch of that white sometime and pull it down and it looks like theres a little light that spilled over the edge. There, thats so pretty"
Bob Ross,"Mountains, if youve ever seen my son, Steve paint them on one of the shows here, mountains are his specialty"
Bob Ross,"He makes some of the most beautiful mountains of anybody Ive ever known in this technique. Thats his forte. There, and thats probably one of the areas that he absolutely puts me to shame"
Bob Ross,"Hes a better mountain painter than I am. There. Okay, lets wash the old brush. beats brush We got to get that camera man over there just almost fell asleep. Well get him. chuckles All right"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take, well use some of that brownish color like so. What do we paint. Lets use fan brush. Take a fan brush. Well go right in there and load a little color on it"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe right there. There lives a happy little evergreen tree. There he is. There he is. See him. Well give him a little friend, a little friend, there. Maybe, shoot you know what happens"
Bob Ross,"If theres two trees, pretty soon theres going to be three and then theres going to be four. Then youre going to have a forest"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back in here, well just take the brush and just tap in some little indications of some things in there. Not a great deal, just a little. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe over here, have a few more of these little indications"
Bob Ross,"And this brown, once again, that Im using here was made from sap green and alizarin crimson and this is a little touch to the green side, a little bit to the green side, not a lot"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right there, right there weve got a bigger chhp, there he is. See, you can just put as many or as few little trees in your world as you want. And everybody sees nature differently"
Bob Ross,"So, you make it the way that you see it. Dont just try to copy. And down here, Im going to have some reflections. All were looking for is just some dark areas underneath right now"
Bob Ross,"Well come back and work on those in a minute. There. Lets take a one-inch brush, same old color, same old color. Lets go right in here and just push in some little bushy areas, there"
Bob Ross,"Once again, this is still to the green side, little bit to the green side. There, right on out to nothing. Okay, take a two-inch brush, grab it and pull straight down"
Bob Ross,"Its important that you pull straight down though. Straight down. There. And very gently come across and we have instant reflections. Hm, I like that. Thats sort of neat"
Bob Ross,"Reflections are one of the neatest things that happen in this technique. Now then, lets begin putting some color in there"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little liquid white, well go right in to some cad yellow and maybe Ill grab a little sap green. Oh yeah, thats nice, a little sap green. Load a lot of color into the brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here, and right in here, yep, lives a happy little bush. There it is. There he is. Maybe hes got a little friend over here. There"
Bob Ross,Go into a little touch of the yellow ochre and well put another one there and just change these colors to any way that makes you feel good. A little red there. I like this red
Bob Ross,"In this particular painting, Im going to put a few little red things here and there. Just let them bounce in, there. Now, back to our two-inch brush, touch just the least little amount of that color"
Bob Ross,"I want a little bit of it reflecting in the water. Phew, ooo, thats nice. There, that is so nice. brush strokes canvas Okay, now we can take a little touch of our brown and we come back in here"
Bob Ross,just put a little land in. Just need a little bit of land. Dont want these little trees to fall off in the water and make a big splash. Scare the little beaver that lives out here. There
Bob Ross,"And you can take a fan brush with some of those same colors on it, the Indian yellow, yellow ochre, red and pop in a few little things and it breaks up this line here, sort of brings everything"
Bob Ross,together. Little touch of the Liquid White. And the Liquid White well use to cut in a little water line
Bob Ross,"Just act like youre trying to cut a hole right through the canvas, just saw back and forth and tilt the knife up and down, back and forth like that"
Bob Ross,And youll be surprised at how well these little water lines just slip right off there. A few little ripples here and there
Bob Ross,"All right, tell you what, we had some little trees on the side, so lets do them. Ill use that same old brown color that we have going here. Well use a two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"You could use a one-inch brush or anything. But well use this since its handy. Take just the corner and begin tapping in a happy little tree, There, just like so. But just a basic shape"
Bob Ross,"This is going to be behind those other trees so we dont really, we dont really care. And you know, its interesting, I have so many little creatures that I like to share with you"
Bob Ross,"I thought today Id show you just a little bit while, cause Im going to do another tree on the other side just like this one, and while Im doing that, let me show you my little pal here"
Bob Ross,"There, in just a few more weeks, shes going to be ready to go back to the wild and Im going to turn her loose right in my backyard and maybe shell build a nest and have some little kids back there"
Bob Ross,"and maybe shell bring them to see me. That little squirrel, boy theyre like little kids, they get into everything, absolutely everything"
Bob Ross,Here she wanted to look at the headset and see what kind of music we were listening to. Now this is true stereo. i mean this is getting into your music
Bob Ross,"I thought my son, Steve, really got into his music, but compared to that squirrel, hm, no he just sits around and listens, she literally gets into it. She is very cute though"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Im just tapping another tree over here. And maybe, I think there was some land area here. We could just use the same color and put in some, just some basic shapes"
Bob Ross,"All were doing here is just covering up the ground. There. Okay, maybe something like so. And you can just push that right in with the whole big brush there"
Bob Ross,"Now, before I clean that brush, Im just going to go right in to a little bit of the redish color and just tap on a few highlights on these trees, just a few"
Bob Ross,"You wont see much of this, but if you look through the big evergreens that were going to put on there and you see some of this, people will think you really spent a great deal of time trying to make"
Bob Ross,"that. Just shhh, you dont tell them any different. Thats our secret. Lets mix up a little green and black, maybe even a little blue, crimson. Chhhp, theres the crimson"
Bob Ross,Let me wipe off the old knife. And Ill grab a fan brush here. Theres one. Theres one. Load a lot of color into the bristles. Lets go up here
Bob Ross,"Now when youre doing this, if you have trouble getting your paint to stick over the top of everything that you have behind, like all the mountains and everything, add the least, let me say that"
Bob Ross,"again, the least little amount of paint thinner. Theres our little evergreen, see. But very little. Lets give him a friend. Very, very little of the paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"A little goes a long way, long, long way. There we are. Lets go on the other side over here. We had one large evergreen here that went, oop, does now, right there, right there"
Bob Ross,"Phew, boy that is a big old son of a gun. He lives up here and looks out over the mountain and the lake and all the little creatures, probably saw the little squirrels living here too"
Bob Ross,This is the kind of place Id like for my little squirrels to live. There. Okay. And that quick weve got some nice evergreens
Bob Ross,"We can take some of this little brown and white color that we had left, put the indication here and there on both of them that maybe theres a little trunk in there, just a little trunk, not much"
Bob Ross,"Okay, back to my one-inch brush that has the brown color. Lets just pop in some nice dark shapes here for our little bushes. There, reflect a little of that down into the water"
Bob Ross,"Okay, other side, well do the same thing, just a few little things here and there. Okay, wherever you want a little bush to live"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can take our brush that we were using to put the highlight colors on, and well put a little color on it"
Bob Ross,"And we go right up in here and we can begin putting in all kinds of little bushes and stuff that live right along here, wherever. Tell you what, tell you what lets do. Lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Let me find a clean fan brush. Got too many of them going. Oh, theres one thats got brown it it already. Well use it. Im lazy"
Bob Ross,"Well take some brown and Im going to reach over here and get a little touch of the Liquid White. To that Im going to mix dark sienna, a little dark sienna, maybe even a little bright red"
Bob Ross,But this is Liquid Whites very thin with a little color in it and were going to load this fan brush with the brown that we made from the crimson and sap green
Bob Ross,"Both sides and Im going to take one side only, just one side, and go through this very thin light color and with this, Zooooooooo, were going to make our little evergreens back here"
Bob Ross,"Big evergreens, Im sorry. Those are big ones, giants. Shooooooo. But by double loading the brush like this, you can do, shooop. See there. You can do both sides of the tree at one time"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres another one here. I dont know. You decide. On the other side over here, we have one, maybe its going to live, zoooooo, right there. Right there. And one, chooooo, there"
Bob Ross,"If you dont make those little noises now, this wont work. Maybe a little one right there"
Bob Ross,"Be careful that you dont space all of them exactly the same distance apart cause if you do, they look too symmetrical. Hm, whatever that means. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Tap in a few bushes down here at the bottom. There we are. Just a few little things. Now then, Ill find another fan brush. Ive got fan brushes going everywhere"
Bob Ross,"That same greenish color that we used to make the evergreen, take that and Ill push upward"
Bob Ross,"Push upward with the corner of the fan brush and just push in some nice little leaves and stuff and some little branches wherever you think they should live, wherever"
Bob Ross,"I like to leave a little of the trunk showing here a little. To me, thats quite interesting. This one goes right on off the canvas there. There it goes. And it sort of gets lost"
Bob Ross,"You cant tell which ones which or whatever. There we go. Well separate them with a little highlight. There. Okay, over here, maybe this one goes all the way off"
Bob Ross,"As I mentioned earlier, this is not going to be an exact duplicate of what you saw in the opening, but it will show you the way it was made. There. All right, now well take another fan brush"
Bob Ross,I say I have several going. Put a little green on it here. There. And we can come along and put the indication of a few highlights on these trees. Dont want a lot. Just a few here and there
Bob Ross,"Just a few. Bloop, bloop. See, and this is where you pick out your individual limbs and separate them is with these highlights. A little on this one. Dont want him left out"
Bob Ross,"All right, lets go over here on the other side and put a few little limbs over here. There we go. See em. Some on this one. Okay, son of a gun, thats pretty nice trees to be done that quick"
Bob Ross,"Well just take our two-inch brush, pull that straight down, create the illusion of a nice reflection in there. Pull it gently across, gently across, gently"
Bob Ross,"Let me find that brush that we made the tree trunks out of, you can reflect those into the water also, just like that. And then pull them, see. But theyre there. They are there"
Bob Ross,"Now, a little bit of that brown. Got to have a little soil down here. There it is. Little touch of brown and white, choooom. There we go. Little bit of Liquid White into there"
Bob Ross,"knife scrapes canvas There, okay. Now, lets go back into our brush that has all the colors on it, the highlight colors. Lets get a little touch of red. I want a little red"
Bob Ross,"Ooo, ooo, ooo thats pretty. chuckles Sometimes these colors are so pretty they almost hurt, shooo, mmm. Theres a nice little bush that lives right there"
Bob Ross,"And well give him a little friend right down here and you decide how many you want and where you want them. Over on this side, maybe back in here, yep, youre right, theres one. Theres one"
Bob Ross,"Give him a little one there. Little bit of the nice red color. I like that red, whoo. Theres another one. And theres one in here. There, do one bush at a time. Dont get in too big a hurry"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Just use the side of the brush. We can put in all kind of little weeds and stuff in there, wherever, wherever. Lets see"
Bob Ross,"Let me take my old fan brush and you can bring this down, straighten this edge up. Make it look like theres a little protrusion out into the water here, a little bit of soil"
Bob Ross,"And thats basically how we did the little painting thats in the opening. So, I hope you try this"
Bob Ross,"It will give you a little challenge, but its a very very nice little painting that will make you happy. Scrape in a few sticks and twigs. Shoot, I think we have a finished painting"
Bob Ross,"So, from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God Bless, my friend. upbeat music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today. You ready to do a fantastic little painting thats quite different. Good"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets start out, and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, let me show you this crazy thing I got going up here today. Today Ive taken some black gesso, just plain old black gesso, and Ive sort of drawn out a little design here"
Bob Ross,"As you can see here, Im gonna have the old oak tree right here or something. And Ive just put a little design here, let the black gesso dry completely. Totally dry"
Bob Ross,"Because the gessos an acrylic base. After thats totally dry, Ive covered the entire canvas with a thin, very thin even coat of liquid clear"
Bob Ross,"And while thats still wet, Ive just taken in a little tiny bit of thalo blue"
Bob Ross,"I put the clear on there only so that when we put the thalo blue in there, we can put like a glaze of a very very small amount of color"
Bob Ross,"If you dont have the clear on there, its difficult to put a tiny little bit. Okay, and with that, lets have some fun, what the heck. What the heck"
Bob Ross,"Has to be a crazy painting in every series, and maybe in this series, this is it. Well start with a little titanium white on our two inch brush, and just load a little color. Lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now I wanna have backlighting in this particular painting. I want light to be shining from behind, and coming through and making some spectacular effects"
Bob Ross,"Lets start right up in here, well just take this titanium white, and just make little crisscross strokes, and begin blending outward"
Bob Ross,"See this is the reason here that we only want a small amount of that thalo blue. If you have a great deal, when you put this white on there its just gonna turn brilliant dark blue"
Bob Ross,"And in this case, all were looking for is a glow coming through. But start in the lightest area and work out"
Bob Ross,"Automatically, itll pick up this darker color, and it gets darker, darker, darker as it comes out. Let the canvas and the liquid clear and the paint do the work for you"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, this is, this is a lazy mans way of painting. Okay, now, little more of the white, and I want some more light coming from this side of the tree over here"
Bob Ross,"So well come right up to here, and doesnt matter if you get a little on the tree, because were gonna paint it anyway. Still, just plain titanium white though"
Bob Ross,"But its mixing with that thalo blue and liquid clear thats on there. And you get this beautiful glow. And it almost happens automatically. So simple, when you use this black gesso"
Bob Ross,"Thats one of the neatest things weve ever invented. Shoot, since we introduced this, its been used all over the country now"
Bob Ross,"Im just amazed that somebody hadnt done it a long time ago, its almost, its logical. You have white gesso, you ought to have black gesso"
Bob Ross,"Now you can do this as many times as you want, to achieve a desired lightness. And you can pull it, and it gives indication sort of like light rays zinging through. Just by pulling it. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe Ill put a little more on this side too, I want it a little brighter. Shoot, when you do yours, you decide how bright you want it. Something like that"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Im gonna mix up, gonna mix up and get the knife here. Take some thalo blue, and alizarin crimson. And proportionally much more crimson than blue, because the blue is so strong. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay Im looking for a lavender color but to the blue side, sort of to the blue, thats good right there. Think thatll do what we want. Wipe off our knife. Tell you what, just use our same old brush"
Bob Ross,"We got it going, and its working well, no use stopping. Tap a little color into the bristles. There we are. Just a little. And lets go right up in here and make some big decisions"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, there live some happy little trees back here. Just start thinking about some very basic little shapes though"
Bob Ross,"And Im using just the corner of the brush, and with that, well begin tapping in all the little branches that are hanging way back in there. Im gonna leave some little light areas"
Bob Ross,"Wanna let some of that glow show through my trees. There, I like these paintings that have the backlighting. My partner Annette, she thinks these are the neatest paintings when they have backlighting"
Bob Ross,"So, maybe well dedicate this one to her. Annette, this ones for you. There we go. Just drop that in. But, all youre worried about now is just basic form and shape"
Bob Ross,"Were not concerned with much of anything else at this point. Later on well worry about things. Right now, were just having fun. Just having fun. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Lets take, let me grab the old liner brush. Put paint thinner on it, and we want this paint to be thin, like ink or water. Very thin though. Turn the bristles when you take it out"
Bob Ross,So it brings it to a nice sharp point
Bob Ross,"Now then, with that, I wanna put the indication here and there, some little twigs and sticks, and just little things that live inside of these trees that hold them all up and keep them together. There"
Bob Ross,"Just a few here and there. Where ever you think they should live, thats exactly where they should be. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now, if you have trouble making this paint flow, chances are you need to add a little more thinner. If you have enough thinner in there itll flow right over the top of that thick paint. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Lets see, I have several old brushes, let me grab another one here"
Bob Ross,"Take a little bit of that lavender color, same lavender color, and go into the titanium white, and I wanna load some color into the bristles. Push the brush, push it"
Bob Ross,"See that little ridge of paint right there. Theres a ridge just like that on the end of the bristles, and thats what were looking for, give it a little shove, little push. Okay lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then Ill put some highlights, think of that light zinging through there. See there. Just a corner of the brush. Just a corner. And begin shaping all your little things in there. Look at that"
Bob Ross,"Look at that, its that easy though. Think about individual limbs, and all kinds of little things. There. See, heres one, where ever you want. where ever you wanna"
Bob Ross,"Those sparkle, because the lights just zinging through em. Okay now as I go back, I want em to get a little darker"
Bob Ross,"So Im gonna take that same color, and add the least little amount of the thalo blue, same color, white with a little thalo blue in it. Push once again to get that little ridge of paint there"
Bob Ross,"Just give it a little push. Now then, well start the next layer of trees here. But because this has the blue in it, its a little touch darker"
Bob Ross,"And itll give the impression that not as much lights hitting it. There. There we go. Once again, work on little individual shapes and forms. See there"
Bob Ross,How you can make all those little doors in there. This is one of the easiest ways Ive ever found of making a lot of little trees real easy
Bob Ross,"Lets go back to the brush that has the dark color on it, were working in layers here, and I want the next layer to be a little darker. Well even put a little of em up there"
Bob Ross,"Right through that tree. Right there, right through the branch, we can see some of those. Now then, lets just create the next tree right in there. Where ever"
Bob Ross,"And every painting is gonna be different, so look at your painting, dont just try to copy this one. Look at your painting and decide what makes it look the best"
Bob Ross,"A little more of that same basic color, make it a little touch darker. Little more of the thalo blue in it. Go back up here, oh thats nice. Thats nice. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And just work these back and forth, create the illusion of all kinds of things in here. Theres one, comes out from behind the tree"
Bob Ross,"Once again, dont worry if you get a little paint on the trunk, because were gonna come back in there and paint all of that. Maybe theres some big ol hangy-down things right there"
Bob Ross,Some big ol bushes that just have limbs that hang over. There. All those little individual things though. Thats what makes your painting beautiful
Bob Ross,"Now Im going back to my liner brush, little bit of that lavender color. Let me get a little more paint thinner. You want this thin, once again, almost like ink. Very thin though"
Bob Ross,See its almost running on the palette here. Turn that brush. Now we can go back in here and begin picking out a few little individual things
Bob Ross,"Better make it a little darker, it doesnt show up well enough. There. Oh now thats better. Had to change the flavor a little. Had to change the flavor"
Bob Ross,"And this is your world, so you can do it any way you want. Maybe theres a large tree, mimicking airplane noise gotta make those little noises or it wont work. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, little more color, lets put a few little arms on this tree. Push it way back in there. There, maybe this one comes right over in front"
Bob Ross,"Dont just have arms coming out the side, lets have em go across the front of the tree, behind the tree"
Bob Ross,"Otherwise it looks like somebody took a big razorblade and just cut your tree in two, and all you see is half of it. Few little knocked off branches here and there"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, thats coming out pretty good. Okay lets go to that other side here and Im going to do basically the same thing over here on the other side"
Bob Ross,Well start with some of the lighter lavender color. And begin thinking about little individual shapes and forms
Bob Ross,"I mentioned earlier in one of the shows that I met a fantastic lady in Florida by the name of Carmen Shaw, and shes allowed me to come out and film some of her animals, and she has some of the most"
Bob Ross,beautiful little Florida deer here. Arent those beautiful little characters. I dont know how anybody can shoot Bambi
Bob Ross,"I like these little characters, I wanna take them all home with me, Id almost move em in the house with me. But these are the most gentle little creatures"
Bob Ross,"And both of these have been injured to the point that theyll never be able to be released again. There. Okay, Im just putting in these same old trees while youre watching the deer there"
Bob Ross,"Its interesting, these deer, for some reason took a liking to my hair and pulled it off nearly. This is a little bitty raccoon, just a tiny little baby one that she just got in. He was a mess"
Bob Ross,"But hes a cute little devil. By the time you see this, hell probably be grown up, and going off and have his own family. There. Okay. Aint he cute though"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little of the paint thinner, and a little bit of color, and just over here Im doing exactly the same thing I did on the other side, just putting in a few indications of trees,"
Bob Ross,"trunks, limbs, branches, sticks, twigs. What ever you wanna call em. There we go. Okay, few little things here and there. Alright. Lets take, Ill go back to this brush, it has mostly white on it"
Bob Ross,"Little bit of the titanium white, and just like we did on the other side, lets put a few little highlights in here. Just to make them little rascals just sparkle in the sun. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"And, once again, pay attention to shape and form and all those little things when youre doing your own paintings. I know you get tired of hearing me say that, but its just so important, so important"
Bob Ross,"There, because I want you to be happy with this. And if it works well for you, then you will. Im going back to my brush that has the dark color on it, and put in another layer here"
Bob Ross,Each layers getting a little darker. As it comes out of this bright intense light. Maybe well begin seeing a little color in some of these. There we go
Bob Ross,"Okay, just think about the shape that you want this tree to be, and the limbs that are hanging over. Say, I really like this black canvas"
Bob Ross,This black gesso is one of the neatest things that Ive ever seen
Bob Ross,"Its one thing about the television show here, its allowed me to introduce a lot of ideas into the art world that Ive had for a long time. And this way, I get to show em to people myself"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And some of them are pretty good ideas, theres a lot of companies now that are making different color gessos and et cetera. So, enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little bit of that thalo blue, and come right along in here. And just put a few little things in there. I will start getting into some color very quickly"
Bob Ross,"So I just want a few little tips sticking out. There, thats really about all I want. Maybe, tell you what, lets make some individual little bushes right here. See. Theres one"
Bob Ross,"And well give him a little friend that lives right about there. But you can create it just layer, after layer, after layer. Try to do one bush at a time"
Bob Ross,"I know sometimes it looks like because were in a hurry looks like we just jump in and just knock in about 50 of em at once, but normally, normally we only do one little bush at a time"
Bob Ross,"And each one is an individual. Im gonna go right into the least little touch, of the cad yellow. Now we have blue on the brush, so thats gonna make a nice light yellow-green color"
Bob Ross,And thats how well begin getting into color up here. Oooh. Look at that. Now weve got some color in our leaves. Just a little
Bob Ross,"Maybe Ill add at least a little touch of sap green to that and dull it down a little bit more. Oh yeah, I like it better. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Okay, a little black, black will dull it down and make a very dark deep green. And well use that a little further on back in here. Just midnight black, hit the yellow. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe it comes right down in there, something like that. Tell you what, lets take the liner brush, put us in a few little trunks and sticks, and twigs, paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"There, see just let some of these show through. There, look at all that, and that sort of gives it a much nicer little feel to it. Because you always have all these little sticks that are showing out"
Bob Ross,"Look at all of them. Maybe, maybe over in here you can make out, yep, theres one right there. You knew it was there, didnt you. Give him an arm too, we dont want him left out"
Bob Ross,"Something there, and by putting these in the foreground, it helps push everything else back. Okay, let me wipe off the old brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets go into some of our midnight black, a little yellow, and make a darker green now. Loading the brush the same way, pushing, just pushing like that"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe in our world, right here, lives a little tree there. Just like that. There he is, there he is. Okay, good. Darker, darker, darker down here. Want it to fade right into nothing"
Bob Ross,Then Ill go back to my liner brush
Bob Ross,"Pick up a little bit of that dark paint, and well put the indication down here, of some little sticks, and twigs, trunks, limbs, what ever ones you get that you can see here and there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, sometimes its nice to take a little of that light color, maybe like a little of that titanium white and have some back in here that are much lighter. Much lighter"
Bob Ross,"There, gonna dull that down a little bit, with a little thalo blue, its too bright. Okay, I have a few of those, where ever you want em"
Bob Ross,"Where ever you want em, maybe a few back in here in this little rascal. But just sort of play back and forth with color, and get it the way you want it. Put all those little rascals in"
Bob Ross,"I think its time we came down to the bottom of that, and begin putting in, putting in. We make a little darker green here, Im gonna add some yellow ochre to that, maybe even a little indian yellow"
Bob Ross,"Quite darker now. Getting into some deeper shadows down in here. There. Nice bush. Little bush lives in there, and hes got a friend named Harry that lives right there. There we are"
Bob Ross,"And, one in there, just where ever you want em. Little rascals just live in your brush, you just sort of have to shake em out sometime"
Bob Ross,"Now lets start working on this old big tree, thats the fun part of this. Lets use a fan brush. Go right into Van Dyke brown dark sienna, just mix em on the brush, here"
Bob Ross,"Just mix em on the brush, load both sides full of color. What ever. Lets go up here. Now then, all Im gonna do first of all, is just go right over the gesso. Just right like that"
Bob Ross,"And because the gessos there, and its already dark, you dont have to worry if you miss a little area or something. This is a big tree here, big ol oak tree"
Bob Ross,"Or what ever kind of tree you want, maybe where you live there should be a sycamore or what ever. Big maple, or, hanging tree"
Bob Ross,I think thats what one of the engineers here in the studio called this when he saw it. Said an old hanging tree
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets go and take a little, little touch of light color, a little white, little dark sienna. But a little bit lighter. And with that, this is where it pays to have a nervous hand"
Bob Ross,"I can just wiggle and jiggle, and carry on and tap, all these little things, itll make, maybe hard to see on here, but you get all kinds of little actions going on. All kinds of em"
Bob Ross,"I hope you can see it, how thats beginning to show up. But we want this to stay very dark, because the lights behind the tree"
Bob Ross,"This is painting is, the light is from behind, its backlit, there we go. Thats really about all you need. Makes painting a big tree trunk so easy. So very easy. And did you know"
Bob Ross,"This is the lazy mans way of painting. Take some sap green here, little sap green, little bit of the cad yellow, yellow ochre, here and there, tiniest little amount of the bright red"
Bob Ross,"You put red in there because its the opposite of green, and itll, it dulls, the red acts as a duller. I know it doesnt make sense sometimes, but it dulls. Now then, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, theres a little bit of, yep youre right. Lets just tap in, just a happy little grassy area right there. Let it come right up. Maybe like that. See there. Darker, darker, darker"
Bob Ross,"Now the more you tap this, the darker its gonna become, because its gonna pick up the color thats underneath. So its gonna get darker and darker. There it goes, follow the old tree roots"
Bob Ross,"Like so, where ever. Okay, and you can change the lay of the land, just by, let me get a little more of that black on here"
Bob Ross,"Watch here, watch here, maybe right in here, we want a little hill that comes down. You can change it that easy. There we go. Darker, darker, darker, darker, darker"
Bob Ross,"Now when you do yours, you make it as dark or as light as you want it"
Bob Ross,"Okay, this is the brush that has the lavender, Im gonna put the indication right here of some little bushes that live back here in the background. And all you have to do is just tap on it"
Bob Ross,"Some little colors, like that. Thats all it amounts to. Im starting to destroy my edge, Im wanna sharpen that back up. You can do that that easy. And maybe, over here, Ill have this come this way"
Bob Ross,"Little bit this way. Like so. But angles are most, most important, and this needs to stay very dark to make that light in the background really really stand out"
Bob Ross,Its that contrast that makes it such an interesting painting. Ill take a fan brush that has the browns on it. This looks like a natural place to me
Bob Ross,"Yeah, youre right, Im gonna have a happy little path. Youd have you come down here and see this beautiful tree. So you need a little path to get back in the woods"
Bob Ross,"Okay, little white, not much though, I dont want this to get too bright. Little white with a touch of the thalo blue in it. So its a cool color in here. Nice cool color"
Bob Ross,"Few little touchups here and there, Over in there, where ever you want it. Now then, lets go back to our old liner brush. Im gonna go right into, well I tell you what, lets use black"
Bob Ross,"Paint thinner, black, maybe in our world there lives a big ol tree, whoops, ran out of paint, put more on there. Right about there"
Bob Ross,"Give him some nice arms, maybe, theres another one there, where ever, where ever. Maybe this old trees dead"
Bob Ross,"Theres a lot of dead trees in nature, so, put em in your paintings sometime, it makes it look more natural and real. Dont be afraid to put a dead painting in your painting"
Bob Ross,"Or dead tree in your painting, boy I messed that up. Sometimes your tongue gets over your eye teeth and you cant see what youre saying. There. Like so"
Bob Ross,"And you can take your time, put a lot of little tiny limbs in there. Really make it look nice"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets do, we need some, we need some leaves on that big tree, but I want them very dark, very subdued. Dark green, very dark green"
Bob Ross,"Lets come in here, and just begin picking out some little individual limbs, and shapes, and forms, but you need to keep this very dark or its going to lose its effect. Very dark"
Bob Ross,"Very dark, look at that. Look at all those big limbs hanging off there. Hope you try this painting, it is one of the neatest little paintings, and its very simple"
Bob Ross,"Very, very simple, even if youve never painted before. This one, you should have pretty good success with. There. Okay, a little bit over on this side, dont want him left out"
Bob Ross,"But, once again, think about shape and form, dont just throw these in at random, because you wont be happy if you do. Try this black gesso"
Bob Ross,"I think youll find it one of the neatest things that youve ever used. Does wonderful, wonderful little things. See there"
Bob Ross,"Now we have that big ol tree, its full of leaves and its hiding back there, thats my little squirrels gonna live when I let him go and he grows up"
Bob Ross,"Shoot I think were about to have a finished painting here. Were gonna call that one done. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,"gentle music - Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Today I thought wed just do a beautiful warm little winter scene"
Bob Ross,"So lets start out, have them do all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me. Theyll come across, right about there. So tell you what. Let me show you what Ive done up here"
Bob Ross,"Ive got my standard old canvas up here. This is a double prime pre-stretched canvas. We dont recommend canvas boards. And onto that, I put a piece of contact paper with an oval cut out of it"
Bob Ross,And thats basically all weve done. Just covered this with liquid white and its ready to go so. Lets go
Bob Ross,"And today were gonna use a very limited palette which means were only gonna use a few colors. So lets start out with a little alizarin crimson. Just a little, on the ol two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Thatll go right up here. And just bouncing a little bit of pink. And this is one of those paintings that just, it should make you happy. Just enjoy this"
Bob Ross,"This is not something you should labor over or worry about. Enjoy it. If youve been with us before, youve probably heard me say it. If painting does nothing else, it should make you happy"
Bob Ross,"It should make you happy. There. Okay, lets do it using a little criss-cross strokes. Just little xs, thats all, thats all"
Bob Ross,"And with the ol two-inch brush it doesnt take too long to really cover a lot of area. And when you get done, shoot you can go out in the yard and paint a barn, or the house, or whatever. There"
Bob Ross,"I know these look like house painting brushes but theyre really not, theyre very fine artist brushes. There we go. Okay, right on up, i dont know, wherever, maybe about to here"
Bob Ross,"Looks like a big Easter egg already. There, now then, lets take, lets take, we wont even clean the brush cause alizarin crimson is not a very strong color"
Bob Ross,Well go right into a little phthalo blue and just put a little into the bristles and tap the bristles
Bob Ross,"See that gets a nice even distribution of color all the way through the bristles, and thats what were looking for"
Bob Ross,"Otherwise if you just hit that big gob of paint and go up here, youre gonna have huge blue streaks that are very hard to work out. Work those bristles in the color"
Bob Ross,"There, and well start at the top and just blend a little touch of that blue into here. I dont want a great deal. Just a little, just a little. And let it blend downward. About like so"
Bob Ross,"Shoot you can even tap in a little stringy cloud here and there if you want it. But well come back and blend this in a second. Right now were just putting little color in, like that"
Bob Ross,"And while we got it on the brush, lets add a little bit down here in the bottom part, which will probably be water. So I say, I think youll do a little winter picture today"
Bob Ross,Winter pictures are very nice. I enjoy doing them. And I like to make winter scenes with a little warmth in em thats why I use the pink
Bob Ross,"Bu some people, when I was talking to my friend Kim just the other day from New Jersey. And he said we wanted a scene that was cold"
Bob Ross,"If you want a cold scene, then all you need to do is just take and leave the pink out, just use blue and greys. Mix a little midnight black with it. Shoot, youll have a cold winter scene guaranteed"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets wash the ol brush. Thats the fun part. Shake it off. laughs There we go, were in business now. Now the brush is good and clean and dry. And the cameramans covered again"
Bob Ross,"We can just take this, and blend it out. Just blend it. And when the two come together, youll get sorta a lavender color, which is very pretty. There"
Bob Ross,"Something about like so and down here, we just go gently, gently all the way across. Were not applying much pressure. Just enough to sorta blend everything together. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, today lets build us a little cloud. Well use a fan brush today. Lets go right into titanium white. Good ol titanium white"
Bob Ross,"And well go up here, and Im just going to put in an indication of just a happy little cloud"
Bob Ross,"Using just the corner of the fan brush, and you can do this, you can do this with a one-inch brush, works very well, very well. There we go. And maybe, let me get another fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets have two of them going. Maybe you want to put a little color into the cloud. We can take a little blue, a little alizarin crimson, and well make a lavender color here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna grab a little white. Little lavender color. Little bit, ooh thats pretty nice. Thats coming along. And just adjust it back and forth until its what you want it"
Bob Ross,"And lets go up in here, and well just come in, and well put a little, a little color underneath. There. Thats all there is to it. Little more of the white. Thatll sorta mix it together"
Bob Ross,"There, let me find a big brush. Now, clean dry, two-inch brush, very gently, using just the corner, just the corner"
Bob Ross,"And I like the two-inch brush, cause it has a lot of bristles on it, and it will fluff it, lift it, tease it a little, and then very gently go across"
Bob Ross,Isnt that a nice way of making a very effective little cloud. laughs You can do that maybe right here. Well have another little cloud. And you can do this either way
Bob Ross,"You can put the light in first, and then the dark it doesnt much matter. As long as you blend them together gently. Let a light in, get my little fan brush that has that touch of dark color on it"
Bob Ross,"A little loving under the base, under the bottom. Thatll indicate the lights coming from above. And then very gently, three hairs and some air"
Bob Ross,"All we do is just, stir it up, mix it up, blend it, fluff it, lift it, and then very lightly just go over it like that. There, and you can put clouds in front of clouds"
Bob Ross,"Maybe you want another little cloud, little baby cloud maybe lives right here. Maybe this is a mommy cloud here. There, cant never tell. Who knows, who knows, There we go, blend em together"
Bob Ross,"Give that a little fluff. And off we go. Aint that easy, we got some nice little very effective clouds. That just float around in the sky, have a good time all day. Wash the ol fan brush off"
Bob Ross,"And as you know, we just wash the brushes in odorless thinner, the little brushes I just wipe on a paper towel to dry em"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take a midnight black and alizarin crimson, just black and crimson today, what the heck. Thats all we need. Put these two together, makes a very dark lavender color"
Bob Ross,"Cut off our little roll of paint, right at the edge of the knife. And maybe in our world there lives, or there does now, maybe theres a mountain right here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, this is an extremely simply little painting were gonna do today. Just want to show you how effective it can be. Just playing with some colors. Very simple little painting"
Bob Ross,This is the type painting that one of our instructors would teach probably in the first or second day of class. And you could do it
Bob Ross,"And we have instructors that travel all over the United States spreading the joy of painting. There, take a large brush, grab this, and pull it. Pull it"
Bob Ross,"Fact maybe earlier in the series, you saw Damen Jester on the show here with us, with the squirrels all over him"
Bob Ross,"laughs I had to have somebody to help me with all the little rascals, he had four of them here in the studio, and well they were giving us a fit. They wanted to play"
Bob Ross,"And as you know, in a television studio you have to be sorta quiet and not run around"
Bob Ross,"They dont know that rule, they just wanted to have a good time and play with everybody here, and of course everybody here fell in love with them"
Bob Ross,"There, but we want this now to blend right into the nice soft misty area there. Very soft, alright. Lets take our knife, this is a fun part"
Bob Ross,"This is a fun part, Im gonna take titanium white, pull it out as flat as I can get it, add the least little touch of alizarin crimson to it. Least little touch to it"
Bob Ross,"Just to warm it up a little, give it a little warm flavor. Pull it out flat, once again, cut across, and we get out very small little paint, right on the edge of the knife. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets have our light coming from the right, cause Im right-handed and thats normally easier for right-handed people. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Swoomp See there, now then maybe have a little snow right there. For everyone, just think about where light will zing through there and play. Make all these little highlights on the mountain"
Bob Ross,"Thats really all were looking for at this point. There we go, I really and truly enjoy doing mountains. As I mentioned before, I lived in Alaska for about a dozen years"
Bob Ross,"And they have some of the most beautiful mountains scenery there that Ive ever seen. Absolutely gorgeous. Alright, I had been born and raised in Florida. I was 21 years old before I ever saw snow"
Bob Ross,"Shoot thats been nearly 10-12 years ago now. laughs Well maybe a little more than that. Okay, there, devils gonna get me for telling stories"
Bob Ross,"Little blue, a little black into it, and off we go, everybody around here is laughing when I say it was just 10 or 12 years ago. Cut off a little roll of paint, and go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Touch, and lets put in the indication of some nice little shadow areas here. No pressure, absolutely no pressure. Just let the knife barely graze the canvass. Just barely touch it"
Bob Ross,"And thats what causes all that breaking, you want all those little holes in there. You want them in there. There, getting maybe a little shadow right in there. Wherever, wherever"
Bob Ross,"Then we can come back, and we can begin adding all kinda of little extras in our mountain. See you can do this, you can put all kinds of little things that you want in there. You can do it"
Bob Ross,"On this canvass you can do anything that you want to do. Total power. There we go. There we go. Very gently, very gentle. No pressure"
Bob Ross,"There, sometimes its nice to go back and pick up a little of that dark, and lay a little dark indication here and there. Just makes it look like theres some deep shadows some places. There we go"
Bob Ross,"But dont overdo, you can overdo real quick. Real quick. There, its a trick I learned from my son. You can make some beautiful mountains, there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then well just take a clean, dry brush and tap this, all over the angles. Always follow the angles, there we go. And lift it. That takes out the tab marks, brings everything together"
Bob Ross,"That easy. Over here, well follow these angles. Just however you painted it, thats exactly the angle you want to follow"
Bob Ross,"If youre coming on like this, and go all the way across, its gonna look like somebody took a big razor blade and just cut it off, and just sorta left it hanging there. So follow those angles"
Bob Ross,"There, and lets go and grab a little of that white, let it look like a little reflected light going down the side there"
Bob Ross,"Another little thing thats fun, take a little of that same shadow color, and just tap in, like so. There it is. Maybe theres just a little hill right there"
Bob Ross,"And that sorta pushes everything back, it gives another plane. Just like that. Okay, looks like theres a little white paint up here in the sky that I sorta missed. Didnt see it"
Bob Ross,"But well just put a shadow under, aint that easy. And well turn it into another little peak. laughs See we dont make mistakes. We just have happy accidents"
Bob Ross,"Cause the mountain looks better now with a peak like that. There. Okay, now then. Lets take, tell you what lets do today, tell you what lets do, I have some lavender mixed up here"
Bob Ross,"Lets see what it looks like. Well take lavender, put a little white in it. And I want it more to the crimson side, so alizarin crimson, phthalo blue, and white thats really all we have here"
Bob Ross,"Ill make a nice, sorta light little lavender. Ooh thats nice, I like that right there. Right there, but when you do yours, if you want it more to the blue or the red side, thats up to you"
Bob Ross,"Thats totally up to you. Heres a dirty fan brush, well just use it. Same one I was making the clouds with, this is number three fan brush. But you can use your six"
Bob Ross,"Alright, load it full of color, lot of color on it. Lets go up here. Maybe in our world, yep, see, right there well push in a little tree. And Im pushing upward here"
Bob Ross,"I want these particular Evergreens to have a little upward arms on em. Depending on where you live, Evergreens are different, in some places, the limbs sorta hang downward"
Bob Ross,"In other places, they sorta push upward. And also depends on the kinda tree it is. Theres a lot of different types of Evergreen trees. There, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe yep"
Bob Ross,"Put another one there, this ones maybe got a little crook. I hate having all my trees perfectly straight. I really rather see trees that have some character to em"
Bob Ross,"I always tell myself that maybe, when that tree was young, maybe somebody stepped on it, or maybe a squirrel ate its top off or something. I dont know. But just anything"
Bob Ross,"Just to keep it from being too bland. And there we are. Okay now then, Im gonna. thats pretty clean. laughs There well just take that brush, and I just want to begin tapping this"
Bob Ross,"And well pick up a little of this color, and bring it over here, and then let it just fade right on out to nothing. See how soft that gets. Good. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then, take a little of that same color, and lets decide where we would have a little reflection, and maybe its right there. Pull it straight down"
Bob Ross,"Just a tiny bit of that reflection, and go across. Now then, lets take us some liquid white, liquid white. Im gonna put a little touch of alizarin crimson into it"
Bob Ross,"Just enough to warm it up a little, so it feels good. Pull it out flat, cut across see. Flat, cut across. Now then, we take that and we go right up here. And lets just cut us in a little water line"
Bob Ross,"Just cut it in. There, just sorta let it wander back into there. There we go, wipe my knife often. There, maybe theres a little ripple here. We dont want too many. Just a few little things in there"
Bob Ross,"Now then, why do I still got that number three fan brush going. I guess its okay. Doesnt make much difference, whatever works for you. Clean off a spot, and lets take black and Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,"Prussian blue is strong, strong, strong. Crimson, so we got black, Prussian blue, and alizarin crimson. There we are. Very dark though, very dark color. Should look black"
Bob Ross,"Cleaning off the old knife here. And, let me just wipe the excess of that number three fan brush. Well use it, lessly, it doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Alright, now, this good dark color and the brush is fully loaded. Lets have us a tree that lives right there. Start off with just a little line, then were gonna push upward. Blueish upward"
Bob Ross,"And with that, well make our happy little Evergreen tree. Just like that. There you goes. There it goes. Yeah, see thats all there is to it. I want to make several of these"
Bob Ross,"And while Im making these, let me share another one of my little creatures with you. As I say, I am such a nut for these little creatures. This is my crow here"
Bob Ross,"And he lives with me, we call him Midnight. Aint he a mean looking sun of a gun. And hes one of the nicest little creatures that you ever seen. Thats midnight. He lives in my backyard right now"
Bob Ross,"And sorta a sad story with him. Somebody tried to shoot his wing off. And its, he didnt do too good for a while. We didnt know if old Midnight was gonna make it for a long time"
Bob Ross,But a lot of nice people have helped him. And I think hes gonna make it. Hes gonna be okay now. But hell never be able to fly again
Bob Ross,"Which is, its hard to watch that, when you see something as beautiful as he is. And hell never be able to fly again. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, well take, lets just grab this two-inch brush, pull some reflections under there. Pull it straight down. Straight down, straight down. And go across. There, right. Now then"
Bob Ross,"let me find, let me find, we use a one-inch brush. Well pop in a couple little bushes. Put some dark color thatll end up being bushes in here. There we go. This is that same dark color. Now then"
Bob Ross,"Lets take our knife, just cut right through there to make the indication of a few little trunks and sticks and everything. There. Do you like that old crow. Hes something else. He is something else"
Bob Ross,"Hes a pretty nice little bird though. I hate it that he, as I say, hell never be able to fly, though that bothers me terribly. That somebody would just shoot him, just for the heck of it"
Bob Ross,Let me grab a little pink here. And Im not opposed to hunting. My father was an avid hunter. But Im opposed to shooting things for no reason. Lets pull a little color in here
Bob Ross,"This is just titanium white with a little alizarin crimson, it wont warm it up some. And we go up here. And lets just put this in. Just a beautiful little snow-covered bush"
Bob Ross,"Right out here on the edge. There, a little more of the liquid white. And the liquid whites in there only to thin the color. Because as you know, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint"
Bob Ross,"And the color we have up here initially is very thick. I want another one, maybe right in there. Work in layers. One layer at a time. Now you can reverse the brush, see there"
Bob Ross,"Put some little doers down here in the water. Down in the water. And this is your test to see how gentle you are. Barely touch, and go down, go across"
Bob Ross,"And we can make those nice little mirror reflections. laugh I like those. Theyre fun. Now then, well take blue, well just use some titanium white, what the heck. What the heck"
Bob Ross,"Come right along here. And just put in a little bit of snow. Like that. There we go. A little bit of our liquid white, that we can come back, cut us in a water line. There we are"
Bob Ross,"And off we go, we take the clean edge of the knife, scratch us in a stick and a twig. Then were in business. And Ill tell you what, today i want to pull this oval off now"
Bob Ross,"And Im gonna play a little bit, you know me. paper peeling Lets just take that right off there. And well lound, there we go. Now then. I always like to have big trees in my paintings"
Bob Ross,"So guess what, guess what, youre right. Lets take that old dark tree color fan brush and I went to a number six fan brush, I want it to be bigger. Lets go right there"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna cut right outside of this oval. And were gonna let this big old tree. Were gonna let him look out into the sunlight. And there he goes. There he goes. There. Okay, pushing upward though"
Bob Ross,"Always pushing upward. There, I wish I had done this with a two-inch brush, because this tree is becoming. Didnt know it was going to be quite that big. But thats alright. Let it go, let it go"
Bob Ross,"Boy, when I said big tree, I was serious this time. Whew. Im gonna stop it there. Otherwise its gonna eat up the whole world. The tree that ate up the world"
Bob Ross,"Sounds like a nice theme for a horror movie or something. Go, another little tree. I gotta have a friend for him. Gotta have a friend for him. Otherwise hell get lonely sitting here. There"
Bob Ross,"Dont want him lonely. Push upward though. Continue to push it upward. Now then, Im going back to my one-inch brush that has the dark color on it. Somehow I have to stop this tree"
Bob Ross,"So well put a bush up under his foot. There we got him slowed down now. We got him slowed down. Maybe, well well just come out here. What the heck"
Bob Ross,"Let your imagination go when youre doing these little paintings. Thats what makes it fun. Just let em go. Let em go. There, there take a little white, little dark Sienna"
Bob Ross,"mix it together, and lets come up here. Put the indication just here and there. Of a little trunk that lives in these trees. I dont want em much"
Bob Ross,"Grab another fan brush, Im gonna take titanium white, and a little bit of phthalo blue on it. White and blue. And lets come back in here"
Bob Ross,"And I want to put a few little highlights on this big ol tree here. So just phthalo blue and white. Like that. Hmm, think about shape and form. I know you get tired of hearing that"
Bob Ross,"But it is so important. Dont just throw this in at random. Youll be unhappy. Little bit on this tree too. Dont want as much on that one. There, darker, darker, darker, down to there"
Bob Ross,"And these little ones back here. Im gonna put a little one back in here too. Dont want them left out. These are farther away, so I dont want as much detail in them"
Bob Ross,Just enough so you know they got a little little something happening in them too
Bob Ross,"And going to liquid white, little bit of the crimson, and lets go in here, and lets put some nice highlights on these little bushes that live right in here. There we go. See just drop em in"
Bob Ross,Drop em in. Maybe theres one who lives right there. And we got a minute left here so. lets put a little path. Take a little white. We gotta have a way to get back to this big ol tree
Bob Ross,There it goes. Just happy little path that lives right there. We need just a couple of bushes on this side. And that will push that path right back in there. We need our dark in there first
Bob Ross,"Then a little liquid white, a little titanium white, and well put a bush over here. Shoot, isnt that a nice way though of making just a beautiful little winter scene"
Bob Ross,"And you can do this, I think youll enjoy it. So Ill tell you what. laughs I think with that, were gonna call that one finished. From all of us here. Happy painting, God bless my friend"
Bob Ross,relaxing music
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Thought today wed just do a fantastic little painting. I hope you have your paints set up and youre all ready to join us"
Bob Ross,So Ill tell you what. Lets start out and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me. While theyre doing let me show you what Ive got done
Bob Ross,"Got my standard old pre-stretched canvas up here and its been covered with a thin, even coat of the liquid white so its all ready to go. So Ill tell you what, lets go"
Bob Ross,"Today, lets just have some fun. Lets just do a little painting thatll sorta make you happy. Its enjoyable. I want to start out with a little touch of the phthalo blue on the two inch brush"
Bob Ross,Dont need a great deal of paint. And lets go right up in here today and lets just have some fun. Lets just dom something like this. There
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its fun just to let your imagination go crazy and just enjoy playing with color and just having a good time. A little phthalo blue, just phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"And this mixing with the liquid white thats on the canvas and automatically you get all this nice blending. Now then, Ill tell you what, lets add a little bit of the Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,"Now, Prussian blue is much darker and much stronger and Im gonna go right around the edge with a little bit of the Prussian blue. Something like so"
Bob Ross,"And were still just using little criss-cross strokes. Ill put some on the other side over here too, dont want it left out. There. About like so. Okay. Thats looking pretty neat already"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe Ill take, Ill tell you what, lets use a little Prussian blue and Ill add a little midnight black to it. Well make a very dark blue. Black and blue"
Bob Ross,"Or blue and black, whichever you prefer. Alright, well come right up here and well just put in a little of that very, very dark color. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, take that same color and go to the other side and put a little over here. Just like so. And were still using little criss-cross strokes"
Bob Ross,"It really makes blending a lot easier if you use those little criss-cross strokes rather than just drawing big circles like that. Okay. Now, the fun part. This is the fun part. Well wash our brush"
Bob Ross,Shake off the excess chuckles and just beat the devil out of it. There we are. Lets take a little bit of the titanium white right on the two inch brush
Bob Ross,And then well move right back up in here and decide where the lightest part of the sky is. And well just begin blending outward
Bob Ross,This is just straight titanium white and this is to put a little bright spot in our sky. Just let it blend outward here. And you can do this several times to achieve a desired lightness if you want to
Bob Ross,"There we are. And just keep blending outward. This is a nice way of making a very effective little sky. Okay, just keep working outward"
Bob Ross,But try not to take the dirty color from over here and put it back in the center. Stay out of the center once your brush is dirty
Bob Ross,If you want to back in the center and work then I would suggest you clean the brush and start fresh. Just really get in here and scrub it off
Bob Ross,"beats brush chuckles Besides, that is fun just to be the brush a little bit. There we are. Okay, thats sort of a wow-looking sky already. Okay, Ill tell what lets do"
Bob Ross,"Lets mix up a nice lavender, well use a little phthalo blue and Alizarin crimson, proportionally much, much more of the crimson than blue. I want this to be sort of to the reddish side"
Bob Ross,"And its hard to tell, lets put a little white in there and see what we have. I want a nice light lavender color. Maybe we need a little more white. Oh, thats getting nice now"
Bob Ross,Thats getting nice now. And just mix it back and forth between the crimsons and blues and white til you get a color that you want. And I think something like thats about what were looking for
Bob Ross,"Im gonna wipe off the old knife here. Maybe well have a fan brush today. What the heck. Lets go right in here, get a touch more of the crimson on there. Oh yeah, there"
Bob Ross,Better load both sides full of color. Full of color. And lets go right up and make some big decisions. Maybe in our world theres some little things that live right in here
Bob Ross,Were just taking the fan brush and sort of tapping downward. Thats all were doing basically here. Se. Just tap downward. Maybe well allow it to come right down in here somewhere. Wherever
Bob Ross,"Wherever. Okay, maybe it comes right on up, just make some decisions. Look at your painting and decide where you think things should live and drop them in. There"
Bob Ross,Now maybe in there theres a few trees that we can see a lot more detail on. Well just use the corner of the brush and work it back and forth. There they are. There they are
Bob Ross,They live here right in your brush. All you gotta do is just sorta shake em out. Just scare em out. Back and forth. Well even make this one a big ol tree. There
Bob Ross,"And were just looking for some basic shapes. Just a few here and there. Shoot, Ill tell you what, that was so nice lets put some on the other side too. Maybe Ill have one over here"
Bob Ross,"Well have a big one right there. Corner of the brush, as you work down that little tree push harder and harder so the bristles downward today"
Bob Ross,"Sometime we make them bend upward, sometime downward just sort of depending on how you feel, what your mood is or how the trees are where you live"
Bob Ross,"Or how the trees are in the area that you want to show on your painting. Just a few more of these little devils. Okay, give him a little friend there. Just a little one right there"
Bob Ross,"And maybe another one. There. Wherever you think they should be. Okay. Maybe a little in there. Wherever. Okay, now well grab the old two inch brush. Be sure its dry"
Bob Ross,"And I want to create the illusion of mist down at the base of this. So take the top corner of the brush and firmly tap. Just firmly tap, thats all were doing there. There"
Bob Ross,And with that you can create the illusion of all kinds of little soft areas in there. Very soft and very misty. And well just let that go right on over to this side and just keep on misting. There
Bob Ross,"You can probably hear how loud Im hitting or how hard Im hitting. chuckles Its hard to hear how loud Im hitting. And very lightly well lift upward, very gently"
Bob Ross,"Very gently, just barely, barely touching the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, Ill tell you what, while we have that old color going Im just gonna add a little bit more to my brush, maybe theres a nice tree that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"And Im just using top corner of the brush, I just want to create the indication of some nice little things that live back in here. See, they almost are the same color as the sky"
Bob Ross,"I dont want them to be real distinct. I want them to be soft, just little gentle things that live back here. There. Got a nice tree going there. A little bit darker toward the base so it shows up"
Bob Ross,But this is a way of creating several layers of little background trees and bushes and all that just with a two inch brush and just with tapping. Okay
Bob Ross,"Maybe it comes right on down here, I dont know, wherever you want it. Wherever you think it should be. Maybe a bit more. Okay. Now then, Im gonna take the old script liner brush"
Bob Ross,"number two script liner brush. Little paint thinner on it and we want to thin this paint til its literally like ink or water but very, very thin. Very thin, look there"
Bob Ross,"And then turn the bristles as you take em out. Thatll bring it to a nice sharp point. There, you can see how sharp it is. Maybe theres a few little sticks and twigs that you can see back here"
Bob Ross,Just a few wherever you think they should be. There. These little devils are always back here in the trees and stuff so just put in a few wherever you want em. Wherever. Okay
Bob Ross,"A few over here too, we dont want this side left out. Now then, Ill tell you what, well just keep on using that same color"
Bob Ross,"Its just basically lavender, Alizarin crimson and phthalo blue and well come right in here and begin just adding all kinds of little things. But look at all the different layers that weve created"
Bob Ross,Thats what will help create that illusion of depth and distance in your painting. Just layer after layer after layer
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add a little of the midnight black to that, I want it to get very dark down in here. Alright. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now, just take that single brush, I guess its alright, well just go right into a little bit of the cad yellow, a little yellow ochre and all Im doing is tapping with the top bristles"
Bob Ross,"You can see it very well there, thats a nice closeup. See that. Just tap it over the top corner. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then, with that we can come back in here and just using that top corner you can begin shaping all kinds of little individual bushes and trees that live in here. There"
Bob Ross,"And we can vary the colors back and forth between the yellow ochre, Indian yellow, bright red, just vary em, let em just sorta work back and forth and change em to however it makes ya happy"
Bob Ross,But do one little bush at a time. Dont get too greedy. Sometimes it starts working well and you get a little carried away and want to do 18 bushes at once. Just work on one at a time
Bob Ross,"Give each one of them a name if necessary. Whatever it takes. Just make em individuals. There. See, layer after layer after layer"
Bob Ross,That really is what creates that illusion of depth and I know you hear me say that over and over but I think thats very important in a painting. There we go
Bob Ross,And way back here maybe just some tiny little indications. Not much. Not much. Not much back here. Just a few little things that hide back in there
Bob Ross,"Then take the knife and scrape through, make a few little sticks and twigs that look white because the canvas is showing through. There. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now shoot, Ill tell you what, lets put a little barn in here today or a big building. Maybe it lives right in here. So take the knife and just scrape out a basic shape, oh, about like that"
Bob Ross,"It removes excess paint, which is most important, but the other thing it does is it allows you to sorta lay out your whole perspective and your whole building and everything without really being"
Bob Ross,"committed. There. Kay. So I said wed have a little shed out here so well just put a little roof, pull down, and all were doing right now is just blocking in color. Thats all were doing"
Bob Ross,Just blocking in color. Like so. There. A little bit on this side. chuckles Wish it was that easy to actually build a barn. This certainly makes it easier
Bob Ross,My father was a carpenter so Ive spent a lot my life building things. I know how difficult it is to actually make a barn. Thats why I said I wished it was this easy to do
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take a little white, a little dark sienna, a little Van Dyke brown, well just mix them together like so"
Bob Ross,"Maybe even the least little touch of blue into it and theyll grey it, thatll give it a grey tone. Pull across, get our little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife"
Bob Ross,"Then you can come back in here and no pressure. No pressure. Just like putting snow on the mountains. Barely touch. Barely, barely touch. Want to make this look like old, weathered wood"
Bob Ross,"Old, weathered wood. Like me, its had a hard life. There we go. Little bit over in here. Zoom. Just barely touch, though. Barely, barely touch"
Bob Ross,And then well take a little more of the Van Dyke brown and make it much darker because on the other side not much lights gonna hit so you need to have that quite a bit darker
Bob Ross,"See in comparison how dark that is. With our little roll of paint still come right in here, decide where the roof line is just enough so it barely, barely shows up. Thats all were looking for"
Bob Ross,There would not be much light striking this side of the building. Not much light. There
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little bit more of the Van Dyke brown and Im gonna turn this into an old slab building, with other words, made with boards and to do that well just the knife, little bit of Van Dyke"
Bob Ross,"brown on it and create the illusion of a lot of little boards in here. Something like so. Now you can smooth that by taking a two inch brush and barely touching, barely. Just graze it"
Bob Ross,"exhales softly Now, for our roof. What are we going to, lets just take midnight black on the roof. Midnight black like that"
Bob Ross,"Get our little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife again and lets just let it bounce along here and play. Just touch it. Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. Gotta make that little noise though"
Bob Ross,"Thats all there is to it. Just let it bounce. Let the knife touch. The canvas will pull off what it wants, give you back whats left. There we are. That easy"
Bob Ross,Now well take the small edge on the other side and I want to make the indication of little shingles showing on the other side. But by using the small edge therell be sorta jaggedy. There
Bob Ross,"Itll look like youre looking at the edge of little doers there. Okay, right here, excuse my arm a second. Make that line a little darker where they come together. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well make a little doer there. Thatll make it a little more distinct. Now we need a door there. This is an old barn, gotta have a place for the cow to go. Well just take a knife and go swoosh"
Bob Ross,"Hows that. Instant door. Well take a small edge, go up here. Well put a little place for the hay to go up. Cut around there. There we are. Shoot, we got a pretty good looking old barn there"
Bob Ross,"What the heck. Lets just keep going here. Well use that lavender and black and a little brown here and there. Maybe. maybe, yeah, right there. And Im still just using the top corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,Maybe Ill put just a little tree right there. Something like so. Alright. Comes right on down. I dont know. Wherever you want it. Something like so. Maybe it comes right in front of the barn
Bob Ross,We go to all that work to build a barn and then well tear it up but thats alright. Thats alright. Now we have several layers of color here. There
Bob Ross,"Yeah, I got a bunch of brushes going here so Ill grab another one. Well take a little bit of sap green, a little yellow, yellow ochre, just tap a little color right onto the bristles"
Bob Ross,A little bit of red. There we are. Lets go right up here. Now we can just begin adding on some little highlights onto some of these
Bob Ross,"Did you ever think you could just take the top of a great, big old brush and make all these beautiful little trees. You really can. You can. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little red and yellow right here, make a nice orange color. Put some color in this rascal"
Bob Ross,"You know, in some of the past shows in this series, especially, Ive enjoyed showing you some of my little creatures. I want to show you one more today. We got just a second"
Bob Ross,Im just going to be doing this while youre watching but this is one my little squirrels and they bring so much pleasure into my life. My mother and I enjoy these. She plays with them too
Bob Ross,"She probably wouldnt admit that but she has about as much fun with them as I do. And they love to get in your pocket and hide and thats where, if youd let them, theyd spend most of their time"
Bob Ross,"Theyre just hiding right there in your pocket. So we call them pocket squirrels. Arent those cute little devils though. These are just babies, theyre just beginning to get fur from their baby fuzz"
Bob Ross,There. Now then. See. He had to hid his head there a little bit. Probably even fell asleep
Bob Ross,"But sometimes in my little pocket there all day and I just walk around the house, forget theyre in there and they go to sleep and take life easy. They really are a lot of fun. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Hope you enjoy seeing them. Just taking a little titaninium white here on the old liner brush and putting in a little tree trunk or two. Now then, Ill just find a knife"
Bob Ross,Ill take a little bit more of the Van Dyke brown and lets come right along in here and lets put some dirt under here. There
Bob Ross,"Looks like the weeds have growed up and just about covered up the old barn. Touch of highlight, dont want a great deal, just a touch. Ill tell you what, maybe lets do this. Maybe"
Bob Ross,maybe there was a big old ditch right there. Big old ditch. Or a ravine or whatever you want to call it. There. Just using Van Dyke brown
Bob Ross,"Allow a little bit of that color that you put on the top to grab the knife and come down. You dont need much color here. Very, very little color. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets go back to our brush thats got the highlight color on it. The little greens and all that. Lets just come right in here and begin putting in shapes of all kind of bushes and stuff"
Bob Ross,"Bushes. There they are. But just using the top corner. Thats all we need. Okay, Im gonna go back to my brush that has the dark color on it"
Bob Ross,Well just put a few bushes here on this side of that ditch or ravine or whatever you want to call it. Put a little dark color in there so the highlights will show. You know what
Bob Ross,"We gotta have a way to get in there, dont we. Lets take some brown. Maybe theres a little path that comes right across here. Maybe it goes back in the woods somewhere. There"
Bob Ross,"Well just use some brown and lay it in like so. And then Ill take a little brown and white, that stark sienna and white and a little touch of yellow ochre in it. Zoom. There"
Bob Ross,Like it come right around. Zoom. Gotta have a little place to walk that goes right on back here. Okay
Bob Ross,"Well have some little bushes that live right down in here and come right up over the top of that a little bit. Little bright red, Indian yellow. Look at there"
Bob Ross,"I like little paintings like this because it teaches you to use just one big brush. Basically, the only brush weve used here is a great, big old two inch brush. And, and, and"
Bob Ross,"a little bit of dark color right here to push this side back. Some highlights on him. Doop, doop, doop. Little bit of red, want that to stand. Ooh, thats nice"
Bob Ross,Something growing right here in front of the old path. Wed have to have
Bob Ross,"if we was gonna cross this ravine here, we would need to have maybe something up here to keep everybody from falling off so well put a little doer like that"
Bob Ross,"A few highlights on it, some brown and white. Come back, lets have a rail across here. Pew. See. Cause Id fall off in there. There we go. A little something for you to hold on to when you go by"
Bob Ross,"There we are. And then our little bushes that are growing right here. Scratch in a few sticks and twigs, all those little things. Now, lets have some fun. We got a second left here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take Van Dyke brown, all on the fan brush, a little dark sienna too, what the heck, just mix them right up in there. Right up. Maybe we have. Yep, you know me. Big tree lives right there"
Bob Ross,"Hes got a friend right there. Like so. Just make him nice and dark. Take our liner brush. Mix a little bit of Van Dyke brown with paint thinner til its very thin, like ink. Okay, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe groans let it wiggle and jiggle, gotta make those little noises. And well put in a few little limbs on these trees. In the back you can see a few little trees that are living in there"
Bob Ross,Put just some nice hanging down branches on here. There. The other old tree needs some too. There we go. But the paint should be very thin
Bob Ross,"If you have trouble making it flow then just add a little paint thinner to it. And were gonna put a few leaves on here so were not too worried about it. Okay, grab another little fan brush"
Bob Ross,I have several of them going
Bob Ross,"Well take some of that black and brown mixed together and right in here in our world maybe theres some, there we are, just a few little things that live out here on this tree. Like so"
Bob Ross,Just push upward with the brush. Itll create that illusion of all kind of little leaves and stuff out here. There. Wherever you think they should be is exactly where they should be. Alright
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take, without even cleaning the brush, a little touch of yellow ochre on there and itll mix with that and turn sorta greenish. And just push up a little highlight on these"
Bob Ross,"Doesnt take much. Want it to stay quite dark. Well, the old clock on the wall tells me its about time to call it a day. I really hope youve enjoyed this one. Its a very nice little painting"
Bob Ross,"Itll show you how to use a limited number of pieces of equipment and make a super paint for yourself. From all of us, happy painting and God bless, my friend. soothing music"
Bob Ross,"- Oh hey, Im certainly glad to see you today. Today I thought wed just do a painting thats maybe a little different and I hope you really enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"So lets start out and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and theyll come across right about there, okay"
Bob Ross,Ive got my normal old pre-stretched canvas up here and today Ive covered the bottom of it with liquid black and the top with liquid white and where they come together Ive just blended them together
Bob Ross,"and its all wet and its ready to go. So, lets have some fun. Maybe lets just do somethin thats make you happy today, just a beautiful little painting"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well start with a little Indian Yellow and lets go right up in here. Well just start in here and Indian Yellow is very pretty, very bright yellow and its also transparent. There"
Bob Ross,muffled speech And then well take a little touch of Yellow Ochre and add mumbling right here. And the Ochre is a sort of gold color. And we just let that blend right on out wherever
Bob Ross,"This liquid black does some fantastic things, especially when you wanna show a scene that has a lot of nice warm mist in it. It really grays all the colors down and works beautifully. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then lets take, well use Bright Red, what the heck. Were gonna make a pretty little painting today that really just shines. There we are. See there, just let em blend together"
Bob Ross,"We havent washed the brush yet, havent washed the brush. Just let that go maybe right on off the canvas over here, we dont care. There. A little more of the red, Ill put a little bit right there"
Bob Ross,"Now then maybe Ill tell ya what, right on top lets use, well make a lavender here, well use a little Alizarin Crimson, a little touch of Phthalo Blue and I just mix these on the brush, it really"
Bob Ross,"doesnt matter, whatever. Whatever, just a little color, we dont need a lot. There we are. Now then, oh thats nice, I like that, I like that"
Bob Ross,"Sorta test it a little bit before we get too crazy and if you dont like it, change the color and you can take it to the blue-ish side or the red-ish side, whichever you want, whichever you want. Okay"
Bob Ross,"A little bit more of the color and well fill up this side also. We dont want him left out, hell be sad. There, just a little. We just sort of fill up the rest of the top of the canvas with that"
Bob Ross,"Now, you wanna blend this until its all together, till you cant tell where one color stops and the next color starts"
Bob Ross,"And when youre painting at home, youll also find that having at least two of each brush, the bigger brushes especially, will save you a tremendous amount of paint, and time, and brush washing,"
Bob Ross,because you use one brush for darks and one for lights and it really will pay you dividends. There. Alright. dinging Time to wash this one and well just use a little paint thinner to wash it
Bob Ross,"dinging laughing Beat the devil out of it. We might as well wash them both, what the heck. There. dinging Actually, I just like to get even with the cameraman because he gives me a hard time"
Bob Ross,"Alright. Lets take some black, well use Midnight Black, oh and some Alizarin Crimson, what the heck. Just black and crimson today, maybe well just make a mountain outta that"
Bob Ross,"Pull it out flat, cut across, get our little roll of paint, lives right on the edge of the knife, there it is. We have to make a big decision right off, where does our mountain live"
Bob Ross,"In our world, I think its gonna live right there, right there. There"
Bob Ross,"And well just do, well just put a happy little mountain in there, just a small one, we dont need a big complicated mountain in this one. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"All were looking for is a nice top edge at this point and we could care less whats happening down here and well take a good dry two inch brush and as usual well grab this and pull it down, just"
Bob Ross,let it blend right into color thats underneath till it looks like its floating there. There. A little bit over in this direction. There we are
Bob Ross,"And its also an excellent way of sort of laying out highlights and shadows in your mountain, just by using brush strokes you can begin dinging seeing all these things in your mountain without"
Bob Ross,"actually doing anything. Now then, Im gonna mix up, Im gonna tell you what, lets take some Sap Green and the Alizarin Crimson in about equal parts, I wanna make a nice brown color"
Bob Ross,"And mix this quite thoroughly. Usually we leave our color sort of marbled, but today I wanna mix this till we have a nice, nice mix"
Bob Ross,"Okay, let me clean off the ol knife and Ill take a little bit of white, and well put a little of that color in it and see what we have. Oh, thats a beautiful brown, isnt it"
Bob Ross,"Well cut off a little roll of paint and go right up here and lets use that to just put the indication of some highlights back here on this mountain. There we are, right there"
Bob Ross,"There, by not over-mixing this, now youll get a variety of colors and shades. There we go. And dont fight that, let it happen, itll make your mountain beautiful"
Bob Ross,"There, no pressure, absolutely no pressure, just allow that to float right down the mountain, that easy, that easy. Just barely, barely caressing the canvas. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And for shadow color lets use some white and well use a little touch of that lavendar color that we made up with black and, just black and a Alizarin Crimson, Ill add a little touch of the Phthalo"
Bob Ross,"Blue to it, there. But its still sort of a lavendar color. Cut off our little roll of paint once again and then go up in here and well use that for some shadows, just drop em in, just drop em in"
Bob Ross,"Put one right here. No pressure, barely touch, come right through, see I pushed that little tip right there back. You have unlimited power here, unlimited power, can do anything here. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, back to my highlight color and I wanna put a little do-er right there, I like to put these little projections in my mountains, but when youre doing yours, you do em anyway that you want"
Bob Ross,"So very individual. There, see. But just by doing that, you can make a whole nother plane in your mountain, give it more dimension, make it more interesting. There"
Bob Ross,"Now, dinging good clean dry brush and well create our mist at the base of the mountain, just by tapping, following the angles, and then very gently, very gently lift upward, following the angles,"
Bob Ross,"so its most important that you follow those angles, most important. Over here, follow the angles in your shadows. There"
Bob Ross,"And we can take that same color and every once in a while I like to just bring this out and let it go like that, makes it a little more interesting. Alright"
Bob Ross,And that gives us a pretty nice little mountain. Here we go. dinging There. Alright
Bob Ross,"Well just take that same ol brush, Imma go into a little bit of that brown color that I made out of the Sap Green and the Alizarin Crimson. Just tap a little bit onto the two inch brush. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now, then maybe back here in our world theres some little trees living here, just use the corner of the brush. And all were gonna do is just put in some very basic little shapes. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Start making some decisions here about where your trees live and what they look like, use the corner of the brush, just the corner, see. And the harder you push, the bigger it is"
Bob Ross,"Then you can begin putting in little tree shapes or bushes, or whatever you want em. There. But you have to make these big decisions how many are there, where do they live, whats their names. There"
Bob Ross,"All these little things, they just sort of help if you make up little stories in your mind, then these things become personal to you, they become your friends and it just sort of makes painting a"
Bob Ross,"little easier and more than that, it makes it fun and painting should make you happy. Shoot, theres enough unhappy things in the world, painting should be one of those things that brightens your day"
Bob Ross,There. Something about like so. And then lets find our little liner brush
Bob Ross,"Well take a little paint thinner and go right into that little lavendar color that we made for the shadows of the mountain, it doesnt matter, its just a light color and itll work"
Bob Ross,"Thin like ink, bring that brush to a sharp point, we can go up here and here and there put in indication of a little stick and a twig. We need some trunks in these trees, we dont want to fall over"
Bob Ross,"There they are. Cause then wed have that old question if a tree falls in the wood, nobodys there to hear it, would there be any noise"
Bob Ross,"dinging Now, I have several of these old brushes going, so Im just gonna take another two inch brush here, take a little of the Sap Green, a little yellow, mix it together, a little Yellow Ochre,"
Bob Ross,"Indian Yellow, and here and there were gonna pick up some Bright Red and well just vary these colors back and forth. There, thats lookin pretty nice"
Bob Ross,"A little rigid paint, just like so, push till you get some color on both sides. There we are. Push, thats what loads that brush, though"
Bob Ross,"Then you can come up in here and start making big decisions here. What color is each little tree, whats it look like"
Bob Ross,"There we go, see I added just a touch of the Bright Red to that, change the flavor totally, completely"
Bob Ross,"And use just the corner of the brush and look at all the little mumbling you can make, that easy. Little rascals live right there on your brush, all you gotta do is just shake em out"
Bob Ross,"But think about form and shape, when you do this dont just throw em on at random because then youre gonna be upset with me"
Bob Ross,"Then youre gonna be upset and we dont want that, we want you to be happy, we want this to work for you. There, a little bit more of the Sap Green, oh thats nice. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Just still varying back and forth between different colors, all the yellows, a little bit of the Bright Red, and Sap Green. Thats a pretty little tree there. Maybe right here, theres another one"
Bob Ross,"And by doing one at a time, putting em in front of everyone that you have on there already coming forward, forward, that creates that illusion of distance, gotta leave some dark areas back there,"
Bob Ross,"though, for the shadows, otherwise it just wont look right. And well put a few right in here. Okay"
Bob Ross,"But look at all the layers in there already, already you can see deep in there and we can take the knife and scrape through, put a few sticks and twigs and just little things that live in there"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna come right here, put some land in there and thatll probably be hard to see against this liquid black, but in just a second Ill put a little highlight on there and itll jump right out,"
Bob Ross,jump right out. There
Bob Ross,"Okay, Ill mix up a little bit of brown and white, maybe even put the least little touch of the Bright Red in there, very little amount of that, just enough to change the taste a little"
Bob Ross,"See, barely touch, this is just like you were putting snow on the mountain, but barely, barely touch. Barely touch, caress it, gentle"
Bob Ross,"And then well take our fan brush and well just use some of those same colors, the yellows and little touch of the red here and there"
Bob Ross,I wanna pop in a few little grassy things that are living out here on the dirt and just let them work their way down
Bob Ross,Thatll break up that straight line and the edges on the dirt and bring it all together. There
Bob Ross,"It also gives my little friends a place to hide when they come down here, maybe well put some water down here and they can come get a drink then"
Bob Ross,"I get a lot of letters from my young friends all over the country and theyre watching those little rascals and theyre learning about how fantastic they can be and that does some good things, if"
Bob Ross,"people just understanded all these little creatures. Shoot, we gotta take care of em, if we dont, nobody will. Alright lets take, Im using that same brown color, same ol brown color"
Bob Ross,"Ill tell ya what, lets just have a big tree right here, you know me and my big trees. Here he comes"
Bob Ross,"All were doing now is just dropping in a basic shape, were not looking for any detail at this point whatsoever. mumbling there we go, well make that decision later"
Bob Ross,"Take a little white, Im going right back into that lavender color, its almost a gray, its more of a gray than a lavender"
Bob Ross,"But, see, let that ol brush twist and turn and all these little things just happen in there, dont fight em, cause thats whatll make your tree interesting is having all these little wiggles in"
Bob Ross,"your trunk. Alright. Go back to my brush here that has the highlight colors on it and well take a little of the red and yellows, mix em together. Alright and lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this tree has some beautiful colors on him too. I think Ill go a little bit more into the red-ish color. Oh yeah, thats nicer, I like that"
Bob Ross,"Just find the flavor that you like and drop it in there. There. Put some little leaves on him here, give him some little arms and there, see em"
Bob Ross,"And its just the corner of the brush, thats all were using, all were using, just the corner. Dont get greedy and get it all. There"
Bob Ross,"Little bit right in there, well just let it drift right into nothing. Lets try a little bit of the Yellow Orchre on the brush too, right there"
Bob Ross,"See, well put a nice little bush lives there like that. Okay. And maybe, Ill tell ya what, let me find a little more of the Sap Green, there it is"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back here is a little, oh yeah, there it is, you knew it was there, you knew it was there, didnt ya. Just drop that right in. Alright. Okay, Ill tell ya what"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well have a little water in there, we talked about the possibility of a little water. Find a fan brush, there, I like that one better"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take some white, Liquid White, mix it with Titanium White, be right back, dont go away, dont go away, a little Phthalo Blue mixed right in with it"
Bob Ross,"I put the Liquid White in there only to thin this color a little bit because, as you know, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint"
Bob Ross,"Now that maybe in our world right here, maybe theres a happy little stream just floatin along and it falls off, splashes a little, just works its way on down here"
Bob Ross,"This is just Liquid White, a little Titanium White, a touch of Phthalo Blue in it"
Bob Ross,"Push here and there to give it a little ripple and splash cause theres stones underneath the water that you dont see and it causes little do-ers to happen in the water, all these little things"
Bob Ross,"Just think about a little stream bubbling along here and playing now, all kinds of little things. There we go. Now, where does it go, where does it go. I have to make some big decisions here"
Bob Ross,"I dont know where it goes. Well just let it run right on off the canvas, then well worry bout it later. Little ripples here and there"
Bob Ross,"I did that in a super easy, nice way to make a stream, it looks pretty good that quick"
Bob Ross,"Ill tell ya what, we need somethin on this side to hold that stream together and well use some more of that same ol brown color and lets have a nice tree right there. There he comes"
Bob Ross,"And all were doing, all were doing, once again, is just putting in a basic shape, maybe well have a nice tree on this side too, we dont want it left out. There we are"
Bob Ross,"And well take our brush that has the highlight color on it, tap a little color and lets come right in here, oh yeah, oh yeah, there it comes and well put some nice little leaves and stuff on there,"
Bob Ross,"change the flavor a little here and there. And off we go. There. See, you can create beautiful, beautiful things just using the corner of a two-inch brush, you really can do that"
Bob Ross,"Imma go into a little of the red-ish color, oh yeah, a sparkler, theres a sparkler right there, right there. Now that one will attract your eye to it"
Bob Ross,"When you start using these bright red ones, be careful not to put too many in because itll make your eye go sort of crazy. Maybe theres one in there. Wherever, wherever. I see where I wanna go now"
Bob Ross,"Maybe lets do this, lets just do this. Take a little of that brown color, just fill this in, come right on out, thatll hold our stream in so it doesnt get away"
Bob Ross,"Them son-of-a-guns sometime will get away on you, just run off and leave you. So lets come right down here, put some little grassy things right on that stream, there they are"
Bob Ross,"Just tapping though, all were doing is just tapping. There"
Bob Ross,"And maybe back in here, yeah, youre right, you were right, theres some more little bushes and all kind of little things that hide in there, there they are"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets get crazy, shoot, we got a minute left here"
Bob Ross,"Take a little bit of the Liquid White, put it out, to that Im gonna add a little Dark Sienna, a little bit of the Bright Red, not much, but I have a very, very thin color now"
Bob Ross,"Take our fan brush, load it full of Dark Sienna and Van Dyke Brown, just mix em together like so and then were gonna go down here and run one side through that light color"
Bob Ross,"So now I have dark on one side, light on the other, maybe we have a big tree, we do now, vocal noises lives right there. And that way you can do both sides at once. vocal noises Have another one"
Bob Ross,"And you put as many or as few in your world as you want. Maybe heres a, oh my gosh, theres a huge one there. There is a huge one there, darken him up a little. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna have a big tree, we might as well have a big tree, maybe well have another one. Sometimes you get started with this and you cant stop, it gets to be fun"
Bob Ross,"Now, you take our liner brush, liner brush, come in here, maybe theres a few ol limbs that hang out here, this is that same brown color. Just let a ol limb hang off in here, wherever, wherever"
Bob Ross,"And you just put as many or as few as you want in here, as many or as few. Theres some back here on this one, maybe theyre behind that one. There"
Bob Ross,"Ill tell you what, maybe well put a few leaves on this so we dont have to be real careful about where we put these limbs. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then, sometimes I like to show a little reflected light on the back of these trunks, so Im gonna take, lets use a little touch of Prussian Blue and Ill mix a little white, we use Prussian Blue"
Bob Ross,"because its very dark and very strong and Im just gonna tap the least little touch of a little reflected light on the back of some of these tree trunks down here, the least little touch, the least"
Bob Ross,"little touch. And well take a little dark and just tap and this is a way you can create a feel of bark on your tree, I mean, when it dries it will feel like real bark. There"
Bob Ross,"Lets come up in here and just take that little brush and tap in an indication of a few little branches that live up in here, just black, touch of Prussian Blue, or you could use brown if you wanted"
Bob Ross,"to, its up to you, up to you. There. Oh, right over my mountain, thats alright, we know its back there. There we go. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then, just leave that color on there and go in a little yellow, thatll instantly turn green cause it has blue in it and well tap in a few highlights. There we are. Just here and there"
Bob Ross,"And with that, shoot, I think we got a pretty nice ol painting, gonna call that one finished. So, from all of us here, happy painting and God bless. light music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today cause I thought today wed just do a fantastic little painting I think youll enjoy"
Bob Ross,"So lets start out, have them run all the colors across the screen that youll need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got going up here today"
Bob Ross,"And today, Ive got all three of the mediums being used on this one canvas here"
Bob Ross,"We have in the top here, I put a mixture of liquid white and liquid clear because I want to have some transparence in this. If you dont have the clear, you can just use white"
Bob Ross,"Down here I put the liquid black, and Ive just taken a brush and sort of stirred it up a little bit. And thats basically all that we have done"
Bob Ross,"And with that, brush rattling against metal if everything goes well, well just do a fantastic little painting. Lets start out today with a touch of the yellow ochre"
Bob Ross,"Just a little bit of yellow ochre. Dont need much on the two inch brush. And lets go right up in here. And well just put in a little, just a little thing like so. There we are. There, okay"
Bob Ross,Then Im gonna add at least a little touch of cad yellow to the brush so it gets a little bit brighter. Im going to come back in a minute and put white in there and brighten that center up even more
Bob Ross,There. Just want a nice yellow color in here. Like that. Youre just using little criss-cross strokes. Here we are
Bob Ross,"Now, without cleaning the brush, I want to touch a little yellow ochre and dark sienna. So I have a nice brownish-yellow color, yellow brown color, whatever you want to call it"
Bob Ross,But a little bit of each. Then well come right in here. Still using the little criss-cross strokes. Like so. Get a little more of the paint and well go on the other side and do the same thing
Bob Ross,I like these little paintings where it looks like the suns glowing through from the back. Theyre very nice and very easy to do with some of these mediums that we have
Bob Ross,A little more of the dark sienna. Want it to get progressively darker as it works away from the light. Progressively darker. There we go. Alright
Bob Ross,"Now, Im gonna begin adding the least little touch of van dyke brown. Not much, just a little. Just a little so it gets a little darker"
Bob Ross,"And then its gonna pick up the liquid black thats already here, and automatically, its gonna get darker. Let these mediums work for you. Let em work for you. Alright. Okay, now then"
Bob Ross,Let me just pick up a clean brush. Ive got brush rattling against metal several of each brush going. And lets go up in here and just blend this together. Just really want to blend it together
Bob Ross,"There. Let these colors just go right to each other. The transition between colors then will be very smooth, very gentle. They wont distract the eye"
Bob Ross,"Sort of looks like a big old egg I fried the other morning. Im not much of a cook. There. Okay, now then. Time to clean a brush. Thats the fun part of this. Thats the fun part"
Bob Ross,"chuckling There we go. Now then, Im gonna take that same little brush and go right into some titanium white. And we dont need much, just a little on the brush"
Bob Ross,Start here and begin working around and around and around and around. We want this to be the brightest spot in the sky. Just work it and blend it. Let it work outward
Bob Ross,But dont go back into the center with a dirty brush. Youll lose that nice glow and we want to save that
Bob Ross,"You could even take a little paint on your finger if you wanted to and make the indication, maybe theres a little sun up here. Who knows. Who knows"
Bob Ross,"And then very lightly, very lightly, then just blend it all together. But itll give you the impression that theres a little sun up in the sky. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then, today, I say lets just have some fun and enjoy it. Let our imagination take us to some beautiful places and see what happens"
Bob Ross,"brush rattling against metal We got the brush clean, thats the most important part of it. Now then, lets take some dark sienna. Pick up a little of the titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Maybe put a little black in there with it. There we go, make sort of a, sort of a gray with a little brown in it. Oh, its getting nice there, its getting nice"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of work it back and forth to you. Find the flavor that you like. There. There we go, lets try that. Well have a fan brush. This is a number six fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Or you could use a number three or whatever. Its up to you. Color on the brush, both sides. Well go up here. And I want this to be like little distant trees back in here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add a little more white. Its a little brighter than I wanted it to be. I want it to be a little more subdued. Oh, thats much better, much better. Im happier about that"
Bob Ross,"There, maybe theres some little trees that live back in there. And all Im doing is touching with the fan brush and sort of pulling downward. Just pulling downward very gently"
Bob Ross,This is a super way of making a lot of trees very rapidly. Or the indication of a lot of trees. There. Just sort of let it taper right on off into nothing
Bob Ross,"Now then, take a clean, brush rattling against metal dry two inch brush. Just want to tap the base of this to create that illusion of mist. A lot of mist. And very light, very lightly lift upward"
Bob Ross,"Just upward. Okay, go back to the same brush, same little brush, and I want it to be just a little bit darker, so just load the brush up again. Same colors, just a little darker"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe in our world there lives, yep youre right, another little layer here. This helps create that illusion of depth in your painting, distance. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe it comes right on down like that. On up here somewhere. We dont even know where it goes. There. And once again, back to the two inch brush"
Bob Ross,"I want to tap the base of that to help create that illusion of mist. Just tap it. Let it just disappear. Okay, and very lightly, two hairs and some air. Just lift it upward"
Bob Ross,But look at the amount of distance weve created in that just by playing with a little color. Alright. Let me clean off a spot to work here. Well lay that over there out of the way
Bob Ross,"Might need it later. Lets go into a little bit of, little black, little van dyke, dark sienna. Now Ill put just a little bit of white in it, not much. I want this to be quite a bit darker"
Bob Ross,Maybe a little more of the white. There we go. There. Makes a very nice color. But its sort of toward the dark sienna color. Thats what were sort of looking for
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, whoops, let me get a bigger fan brush. Goes a little faster. Picked up the number three and I think Ill use the number six. Number three would work just as well. There"
Bob Ross,"Its just that I want to go a little bit faster. So, well use this one and well drop an indication here and there of some happy little evergreen trees"
Bob Ross,"But these are closer, so you see a lot more detail. See how that darker color stands out against that light. Mmm. Just sparkles. Just sparkles. Maybe theres some little indications, I dont know"
Bob Ross,"Maybe they come right on down like that. See a few little more little indications behind those trees. There, another one. I think we see some detail there. Okay. Lets have a few on the other side too"
Bob Ross,"I dont want that side left out. Maybe, shoot, maybe theres a big one right there. But the same way, use a corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,"As you work down the tree, push harder and harder just to add more pressure. Make the bristles bend down much more. Like that, look at that. You can do that. There we go. Have another one"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, we just painting a whole forest here. And thats alright. Thats alright. Put as many or as few in your world as you want cause painting is very individual"
Bob Ross,"Everybody, everybodys gonna see this differently and thats the way it should be. Thats the way it should be. There. Okay, maybe. I know, lets have one more over here"
Bob Ross,"Well have one more of them little devils. Right on out. Now, sometimes its interesting to show different depths. Maybe Ill add more black to that"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back in here, you can see a few more back in there. There. Just let em sort of fade in there. Whoa, we really do have a forest, dont we. Now, once again, two inch brush"
Bob Ross,"I want to create that illusion of mist. Oh, let me show you a trick. Let me show you a trick, let me show you. Let me show you. Just, I saw something. I get excited sometimes, please excuse me"
Bob Ross,"Now see here, if you want to take these trees right here and push them further back. Let me put some mist and well take. Lets just strengthen this tree here a little bit because that mist is there"
Bob Ross,"Watch here, watch here. Look how I push that tree back just by doing that. Thats a little trick that helps show distance in a painting. That misty area is so important"
Bob Ross,"Now, when we create the mist here, we dont want to destroy that edge. We just want to tap in here. Just sort of let em blend together. Look at there though. But look at the layers in there now"
Bob Ross,"And when youre doing your painting, look at these things. Pick em out, make em work for you. Shoot, but theyre lazy if you dont find em and force em a little bit"
Bob Ross,Theyll just lay there and sleep. Like me when the alarm clock goes off in the morning. There. Same thing over here. Well just let that blend right in to just about nothing
Bob Ross,"In fact, Ill put a little color on the brush. Maybe theres a big tree that lives right here, I dont know. Some nice little bushy things back in here. Add a little bit more of the dark color. There"
Bob Ross,"But see, each layer gets darker and look at the amount of distance in this little painting already. Theres so many plains in there. And these little plains are what create that illusion"
Bob Ross,"And theyre really not hard to do. Theyre really not hard to do. There, just work on one level at a time though"
Bob Ross,Sometimes we get in a hurry because it starts to work real well and it feels good and we just wanna on. You know what Im saying. We get carried away. I bet its happened to you if you painted
Bob Ross,"Certainly happens to me. I start seeing all these different things and next thing I know, Im out in left field somewhere. There, we put one here too, what the heck. Maybe, maybe, maybe"
Bob Ross,"There I go with that maybe again. Maybe we have, yep. Maybe theres a little bush lives right there. Right there. See. You see these things and you drop them in. Alright. Okay, now then"
Bob Ross,"We can take our knife and just sort of make the indication here and there of some little trunks. I dont want these to be too distinct, too far away, or too subdued"
Bob Ross,"But you can see a few little things here and there. And we can take that same little brush that has a color and Im gonna add a least little touch of maybe some yellow ochre, a little bright red to it"
Bob Ross,A least little touch. I dont want much color on the brush. Very small amount
Bob Ross,"And just here and there, I want to pop in a little of that color to make it look like theres a little highlight on some of these. But its real easy to overdo here"
Bob Ross,Too much will distract and youll lose that softness. And thats one of the things thats so great about using the liquid black
Bob Ross,That liquid black will always make things look very misty and very soft because it grays color. It adds a gray color. Lets see here. Find my old brush
Bob Ross,"Well just use the same old brush, what the heck. Im gonna go right into a little touch of the yellow ochre. All the yellows. Indian yellow. Be right back, dont go away. Get a little white"
Bob Ross,"intakes breath Oh, thats nice. I want a bright one right here. If our suns right there and its shining down. Look at there. I want a sparkler. The lights gonna strike that"
Bob Ross,"Its really gonna be pretty. There we go. Look at all those beautiful little colors. Maybe right there. Put a nice little red color in there, let it just work its way back"
Bob Ross,"Just using the corner of the brush, thats all you need. Its really all you need. water splashing I want to take a little paint thinner and go into some van dyke brown"
Bob Ross,"Here and there, well put the indication a little tree trunk. Some little sticks and twigs and all those little things that live in there. Maybe back here, we can see some things. Old dead tree maybe"
Bob Ross,"Wherever, wherever. Theres one, mmm. Thats an old crookedy one. That ones crooked. water splashing brush tapping Okay, tell you what lets do. Lets get crazy here"
Bob Ross,"Lets get crazy and have some fun. Maybe theres a little house sets here. You know me, I like little houses and big trees. Thats my thing. If you dont want a house in yours, dont put it in"
Bob Ross,"Every once in a while, I get a letter from somebody said, I didnt want a house in that painting.  And you have that right. When you do yours, do it any way that you want. There"
Bob Ross,We get a lot of letters from people all over the country who are painting and doing fantastic things
Bob Ross,"The photographs that people send me, sometimes its almost unreal that people are doing such beautiful paintings. Every so often, we like to put em together and show em here"
Bob Ross,So send me a photograph of what youre doing. Share with us and well share it with the TV audience and let everybody see it. If you dont mind
Bob Ross,"If you dont want it shown on TV, if you send a picture, just say so. Well respect that. There. Lets go right here"
Bob Ross,"And we can just use a little bit of this brown and sort of decide where we want everything to live. Touch, toom, pull. All were doing, blocking in color. Get some dark in there so our light will show"
Bob Ross,"Maybe it comes down. Maybe its got a longer roof on the other side, see. Some little houses are like that. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"There, and while we have that brown there, we can just block in some sides and front. Maybe this is a, I dont know what kind of building this is. Maybe its an old barn. You decide"
Bob Ross,"You can make a little house or a barn or whatever. Whatever. Now, well take some white, a little bit of that brown color, and just mix em together. There we are, something like so"
Bob Ross,"Cut us off a little roll of paint like that. Touch. whistles softly See, just go down like that, but you gotta make that little noise or it doesnt work"
Bob Ross,"whistles softly And our lights coming from here, swoom, so thatll be the brightest side. Same color. Ill add a little dark sienna and van dyke brown to it. Same color though, same color"
Bob Ross,"whistling softly There I go with that noise again. Really, some reason, maybe its the exhaling of air or something, chuckles but it really does seem to make it work a little better. There"
Bob Ross,"Very gently. Create the illusion of an old building. Now then, on our old building, lets have some boards. Well take some van dyke brown here, just a small roll and just touch. Just touch, see there"
Bob Ross,"Create the illusion of some boards. Want a few on this side. There they are, there they are. Let em go, let em go. Were gonna have one neat building here in a minute"
Bob Ross,"Well take our two inch brush and only one hair and some air. exhales air Just barely caress, barely. Just barely. Just barely touch it"
Bob Ross,"If you want to smooth it out, you may like it a little rougher. I want to smooth this one out a little bit though. So its up to you. Let me take the little knife. I like that little knife"
Bob Ross,"And lets put a door in here. Maybe Ill put a big old door like that. And well let everybody figure out what their own building is. See a little light right there. Around, choom. There we are"
Bob Ross,"For the roof. For the roof, well take some white, a little bit of brown, maybe the least little touch of black in it. Oh yeah, grays it down some more. But dont over-mix it"
Bob Ross,"I want a lot of things happening right there on the knife. And we touch. And this is where, if youre a little nervous, itll pay great dividends. Just touch. jibber-jabbers Let it work its way down"
Bob Ross,"There I go with those noises again. There. Now just a tiny little bit on the other side. Just this little light zinging through there. Shoot, we got a pretty nice looking little building there"
Bob Ross,"We can live with that. Take a little dark color. Ill use some black and some browns, a little alizarin crimson in there too. Lets come right along in here"
Bob Ross,Touch and lets begin thinking about how the lands gonna flow around this little building. How do we want it to go. This is where we cut it off and get our perspective right. There
Bob Ross,"Okay, thats about all we need cause we got the black there. Maybe on the other side something comes down. Yeah, thats good. Lets put that right there. Im beginning to see some things in here"
Bob Ross,"Alright. Tell you what, tell you what. Let me find, yeah, well use a one inch brush today. Well be different. Take a little sap green, a little yellow. A little yellow ochre"
Bob Ross,"Be right back, get a little black in there too. There, its nice. A little indian yellow. And put a little red in there. Red dulls it cause red and green, as you know, makes brown"
Bob Ross,"And maybe in our world, maybe theres some happy little bushes that live right along here. Im just pushing upward with a side of the brush. Just pushing upward. Want to make like tall grass here"
Bob Ross,"whistles Maybe. Let me find the little knife again. Tell you what, maybe theres a nice stone lives right there. We can do it with a knife or you can do it with a filbert brush, thats very nice too"
Bob Ross,"Just touch. whistles softly Just make the indication of just a happy little stone. There we go. A little grassy thing that comes down, pushes that stone right into there. Just keep pushing"
Bob Ross,"Like so, there. A few little things over here. Wherever, wherever, wherever. We have to have a path in there. Theres just no getting around it. Have to have a path"
Bob Ross,"Let me take a little of van dyke, dark sienna. Lets have a little path comes right down there. Right there. And once we get down here, we gotta have. Lets go back here. There it comes"
Bob Ross,"Well have another little path there. So he can walk down here and walk on up wherever he wants to go. A little white. A little touch of blue here and there too, just to gray it down"
Bob Ross,"The least little touch of, oh, thats nice. Gives it a little cool flavor. A little cool flavor. There we go"
Bob Ross,Then we can just bring some of these little grassy things right up to the path and thatll push it back down in there and make it all part of the painting. Make it work
Bob Ross,"And this is just using the side of the brush. Lets put a few on the other side. So you just push upward. Just bend it, bend it. There"
Bob Ross,"And work in layers, doing the thing thats farthest away first and always coming forward. Always coming forward, forward, forward. There we go. Create the illusion of a little hill there. Now then"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, let me find another fan brush. Ready to get crazy. Lets do it. Lets go into, we use van dyke brown, a little dark sienna. Lets go up here. Maybe in our world, yeah you guessed it chuckles"
Bob Ross,"Here comes Bobs big tree. whistles Right there. Right there, lets give him a friend. Theres one. hums And let these old trees wiggle and jiggle and have character"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres one back here in the back somewhere. He lives right back in there, stops there. Hes got a little friend over here. Just make out some little indications, whatever. Whatever"
Bob Ross,"Man, let me find the liner brush. There it is. These brushes, if you dont watch it, theyll sneak off and hide on you, leave you by yourself. We have a few limbs hanging right here. Theres one"
Bob Ross,"Old limbs hanging out here, watching the sun shine. There. Tell you what, lets put some leaves up there. Lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Well just a little brown and black, least a little touch of the blue, not much. And lets just come right in here. Just use the corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well let this old tree just hang right out here by the sun. Right out by the sun. Mmm, looka there, looka there. Mmm. Isnt that nice. That is nice. Alright, well leave this one branch hanging"
Bob Ross,"I like him out there by hisself. See, you pick out little favorites and you leave em. You paint something nice in your painting, be careful, save it. Shoot, work around it sometime if you can"
Bob Ross,"No use messing up the good stuff. Well take a little highlight color, see if that shows up. Yeah, its enough. Then well just put a indication here and there. A few little leaves up there"
Bob Ross,"There we go. There. Just the corner of the brush. Pay attention to shape and form. I know, youve heard that before. There"
Bob Ross,"Even, sometimes in the newsletter that we publish, Ill put little articles in there about shape and form and how to create em. There. And that gives me a little more time"
Bob Ross,"In the newsletter, I can talk about things a little more and show cause I dont have the time restraints that we have here. There we go. Down at the bottom here, put a little grass around his foots"
Bob Ross,"We want that to just settle right in there. There, okay. And we can take a little bit of light color on the fan brush"
Bob Ross,"If you wanted to highlight the edge of this tree so it stands out, just whistles. Put a bit of light. Really makes these little trees look a little better"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, I think we about have a finished painting. You can scratch in a few little sticks and twigs wherever you want em and itd be done. Think well call that one finished then"
Bob Ross,"So, tell you what, from all of us here, happy painting and God bless, my friend. cheery music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad to see you today. This is the last show of the 20th series, so Im very very glad youre with us"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us at home"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, let me show you this crazy thing I got up here today. Ive taken a plain old canvas and this being the last show were a little silly here today so we thought wed just play"
Bob Ross,Ive taken a little bit of tape here and taped a little here. And then I just had some contact paper left over and Ive just covered a couple of areas. And I thought wed do something
Bob Ross,"Hmm, so I say, its the last show, so lets just have some fun. Lets start out today with a ole two inch brush. A little touch of the phthalo blue. Just a small amount"
Bob Ross,A little phthalo blue and lets go right up in here. Maybe well do two paintings at once today. How is that. Might as well have a little challenge. I have two paintings at once
Bob Ross,Lets do one in summer and one in winter. Hows that. One in summer and one in winter. Thatll be a challenge off the same palette. Thatll give you some experience with both seasons
Bob Ross,"Itll make things nice for you. Lets add, while we got that blue going there, Im gonna put the least, least little touch of the phthalo green into it. Just the least little touch. Dont want much"
Bob Ross,Now Ive got a little line taped right here and I wanna stay on the right side of that line. There we go. Dont want to contaminate these two if its gonna look like two different paintings
Bob Ross,"I think Ill have it looking like one painting is laying on top of the other one. All right. Well just try that and see if it works. If it doesnt, weve had a good time anyway"
Bob Ross,"Ive certainly enjoyed being with ya. There we go. Now then. Tell you what, I have several brushes, so let me grab another one here. Now, Im going to the least little touch of the Indian yellow"
Bob Ross,"Just a very small amount. And maybe on this one, Ill have a little touch of yellow right here in the sky. Just a little bright spot"
Bob Ross,"And Ill go without cleaning the brush, go into a little bit of bright red. Just let it blend together. Right up to that little piece of tape. You dont wanna go across it. Dont wanna contaminate"
Bob Ross,"There. Now then. maybe well take a little blue, a little alizarin crimson, well make us a little lavender color. And we can do that right on the brush. Just mix it on the brush, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"And come right in here. And well add a little bit of that in there. Just have fun and enjoy. There we are. And maybe just a little blue over here. All right. And then down here, just pull across"
Bob Ross,"Like that. All right, let me wash the old brush here. Getting too many of them dirty. Shake off the excess. Bob laughs And cover everybody in the studio"
Bob Ross,"You dont have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Now then, well just blend this all together. Make sure the brush is good and dry"
Bob Ross,If its not itll thin your paint out and it just doesnt work too well. All right. Wash the old brush off again. Get it as clean as I can. loud thuds And dry it off. And very lightly here
Bob Ross,Add a little touch of the titanium white. I wanna make this very bright. Like this is our light source. Start with the white in the light area. And work outward. That just takes off any excess paint
Bob Ross,"There, thisll be our winter scene here. So I had a little bright spot in the sky so its not too dull. All right. Now then, well use a one inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Maybe we have a little cloud up in the sky up here in this one. And a little cloud lives, its a little titanium white"
Bob Ross,"A little cloud just lives right here and floats around and has a good time, plays. There he is. Okay. A little bit more of that white. There, just make little circular patterns. Just enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"Let it just sort of float around and have fun. There it is. Okay, well take a clean, dry, two inch brush. And we just sort of mix that up, stir it a little bit using just the top corner"
Bob Ross,"Just blending a little bit so it sort of comes together. Then lift it, fluff it. There we are. Clean brush, very lightly go across"
Bob Ross,"And that easy, we have a happy little cloud living up here in the sky. Now then. Shoot, lets have some more fun. Well take some black, a little Prussian blue, and some alizarin crimson"
Bob Ross,"Black, blue, alizarin crimson. Okay, cut us off our little roll of paint as usual. And lets build us a little mountain. A little mountain right here. There he is. Just however you want it"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres another little peak there that goes out. Now while we have that, lets do the same scene down here. Only in winter. Well do one in summer and one in winter"
Bob Ross,"And they wont be exact, but well just have a basic idea here. Theres our little mountain. Well let it go right down through there. Sometimes we can use the same colors for both of them"
Bob Ross,"And we add a little bump there. There we go. Scrape off all the excess paint. Just really get in there and scrape it. Now, take a clean two inch brush, grab that and pull it. Just pull it. Let it move"
Bob Ross,"There. Okay, and blend right out to nothing. Okay, now then. Up here on this one, same thing. We wanna grab this and pull it. Just pull that color"
Bob Ross,"Those two things, as you know if youve painted along with us, it removes excess paint. It makes the next layer stick much easier. And it creates this misty illusion down at the base of the mountain"
Bob Ross,"All right. Okay, now we can wash the ole brush again. loud thuds Bob laughs There we go, there we go. Now then, I bet theyll be glad to hear this is the last show of the series"
Bob Ross,"Itll probably take them a week to clean the studio up. Lets see, lets take some white, some midnight black, maybe the least little touch of dark sienna into it. There"
Bob Ross,"Leave it marble like that, dont over mix it. Then cut across, and our little roll of paint. And lets go up here in this little mountain. And lets just put in some nice little highlights up there"
Bob Ross,"Barely touching the canvas, barely touching. Whisper light. Whisper light. On some of the other series Ive told about when I was teaching my son Steve to paint"
Bob Ross,"I used to tell him just to pretend he was a whisper floating across the mountain. And it certainly must have worked. That little son of a gun can out paint me now, whew. Dont tell him I said that"
Bob Ross,"Hell be wanting my job. There. And maybe right along in there. Clean off a little spot to work. Well make a shadow color. Well take some white. A little bit of Prussian blue. Not much, very strong"
Bob Ross,"Some black. And well make a very dark greyish color. But sort of to the blue side. There we go, nice. A little roll of paint again"
Bob Ross,"And lets go right up in here, and just put the indication of just a happy little shadow that lives up here in this mountain. And, a little bit right in here. Theres some more. A little bit back here"
Bob Ross,Theres some. And we just sort of let that just go right on out into nothing. Right out into nothing. This is a very special series to me. The 20th series means theres 260 half hour shows now
Bob Ross,Its unbelievable that weve been able to accomplish that. And its not something you do alone
Bob Ross,"Theres a lot of very special people that have worked very hard to make this come together and to bring you these shows. Theres Walt and Annette, my partners"
Bob Ross,Theyre always there and theyre very supportive and I appreciate all of their efforts. And Id like to publicly say thank you to both of them. Theyre very special to me. And my wife Jane
Bob Ross,"She hangs in there. Its hard to live with a crazy old painter, Ill tell you that. But these people are very special to me. Well just take an ole two inch brush here and tap a little"
Bob Ross,"Lift it up, blend it like so. A little bit over here. There we go. And well just sort of let it go right into nothing. Something like that. Ill put a little more at the top"
Bob Ross,"Apparently I dont care for the top. There, like that better, just break it up a little. Down here in this one, lets take some white, a little bit of the bright red in it"
Bob Ross,"Not much, just a little, just a little. And on this one, since its winter, lets just use white, a little bit of bright red. Put them little rascals right in there, shoom. There you go"
Bob Ross,"A little touch back here. Like that. And we use a little Prussian blue and white for shadow. Come right in here, drop it in. See, theres the same basic idea just using a different color"
Bob Ross,Then if you wanna do the same thing weve done up here by putting some little doers here and there. Some little ridges and everything. You can drop those in too
Bob Ross,"Yeah, but as I say its hard to believe theres 260 shows. Son of a gun. Its almost unreal. Unreal"
Bob Ross,"And if you hadnt got to see all of them and you would like too, of course Im just assuming that youd like to. Give your station a call, let em know"
Bob Ross,"Its important that they know that you wanna see em. And if you want to see em, as I say, just give em a call. The shows are certainly available to em. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe Ill put a little touch of shadow right there behind that little peak. You gotta have one there too"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets just take, well take a little sap green, a little dark sienna, and grab some white here. Whatever color we got. Whatever. Okay, there we are. Making sort of a greenish color"
Bob Ross,"Lets go right up here in this top one. Maybe theres a little footy hill that lives right back here. Well just do a very basic little painting thing, very simple. Very simple"
Bob Ross,"This is a good one for you just to practice and have fun with. Dont want it to get too complicated. Not if we have to do two of them especially. Touch, pull straight down. Straight down"
Bob Ross,"Well just turn that right into some reflections. Get a clean brush. Nice clean brush, pull it down. And go across and we have instant reflections. That easy. That easy"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little liquid white on the knife. Put it on the palette, pull it out very flat, cut across. And then well just take the knife and literally cut in a little water line here"
Bob Ross,"Just cut it in. Okay, maybe a little touch more there. And we can see a little ripple here and there. All right, now then. Lets come down here on this bottom one"
Bob Ross,"For that, Im gonna take a little touch of the lavender into a little white. Same lavender we made the mountain out of. Into a little white. And well make us a little footy hill on this one"
Bob Ross,"Just a little tiny foothill. Okay, there it goes, right there. Same thing though, pull down to create that reflection. And go gently across. Gently across. Back to our liquid white"
Bob Ross,"And we can use that just to cut us in a little water line. Okay, now sometimes its neat. We can take a one inch brush"
Bob Ross,"If you wanna make this look like little distant trees, well start up here at the top. You can grab it and just lift upward. Little tiny short strokes, work in layers"
Bob Ross,Itll create that illusion of little distant trees that are far far away. Clean the brush a little bit. We can do the same thing down here in this winter one. No difference
Bob Ross,"Now then, time to really have some fun. Tell you what, lets do. Let me clear off a space to work here. I get carried away. As big as this palette is, I fill it up with a lot of garbage"
Bob Ross,"I take some black, some Prussian blue, and well put some alizarin crimson in there. Like that. Okay, let me clean off the ole knife. Lets make us some little evergreen trees. Grab a fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Fill the brush full of color. Just a lot of color, both sides. Lets do the ones down here in the winter scene first. And well have a nice little evergreen that lives right here. Or big evergreen"
Bob Ross,"Shoot that rascal got big on us. But notice in the winter one, I use no green. Cause if were gonna have snow down here, the only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow"
Bob Ross,"So were not gonna use any green in these trees. There we go. Ill have a little friend there. Choo, choo, choo. Tell you what, lets have a third one"
Bob Ross,"I like little trees, maybe this one sort of got a little crook in him. This is a crooked tree. Now then. Now that I have that going Ill just take a one inch brush. This is predominantly blue though"
Bob Ross,Thats the main color here. And lets go right in here. And maybe well have some little bushes that live right here. We just sort of let em move right on out like that
Bob Ross,"Like that, wherever you want them. Now, lets take same color. And I did this winter one first because I wanna take the phthalo green that I have and add it right into that same dark color"
Bob Ross,"And then in the summer trees, theyll have some green in em. Okay, we can use the same fan brush. It doesnt matter. It doesnt matter, well just fill it right up. A lot of color though"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Okay lets go back up here. Lets see, a little tree lives, about right there. Certainly does now. There we are, just use the corner of the brush and off you go like that"
Bob Ross,"See there, them little trees live in there. You just have to scare them out sometime. But theyre in there. They live right in your fan brush. Right in the old fan brush. And we add a second tree"
Bob Ross,"Yup, right there. There he is. Here we go. Right on down. And we add that little baby tree that was sort of leaning over. And he lives right about there. Okay, here he comes. Little guy, little guy"
Bob Ross,"Had to give him a name, maybe his names Oscar. What the heck. Whatever, it doesnt matter. Just make up a little name you give him. Back to our one inch brush. And we add the little bush"
Bob Ross,"Lets see, Ill make it close as I can to the one down below. Have it coming all the way on out here like that. You can do that. And then well just fill all that in. Just fill it in. All right"
Bob Ross,"And off we go. And well take some white, a little bit of the dark sienna, and well mix that together. Cut across, get our little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"See, just cut across, there it is, right on the edge of the knife. And with that, well go right up here. And well put the indication here and there of a little tree trunk"
Bob Ross,"It just sort of hides out in the middle of this tree. There we are. Bob hums We can even put a little in this winter scene too, it doesnt matter. Its smaller, youre not gonna see as much though"
Bob Ross,And with a clean knife you can just scrape through here. Put all kind of little sticks and twigs in your bushes. And 90 of these will be covered up when we put the highlight on
Bob Ross,"But here and there, people are gonna see one or two. And theyre gonna think you worked for days and days with your little one haired brush putting all those in. Shh, we dont tell them any different"
Bob Ross,"Thats our secret. There, you just raised the price of your painting a little bit and keep on going. All right, wherever you think they should be. Now then, lets find a nice one inch brush here"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, maybe well use this one. Dip it in a little bit of liquid white. Liquid white, well go right into some cad yellow, Ill be right back, get a little sap green. Oh thats nice"
Bob Ross,"Pull that brush in one direction. Load a lot of color into the bristles. Look at the end. Look at all the paint thats in there. Thats what makes it work. Now, right up here, this nice summer scene"
Bob Ross,"Lets put some little leaves on some of these bushes and stuff right here. A little yellow ochre, a little Indian yellow. Here and there, maybe even a little touch of the bright red"
Bob Ross,"Get crazy, heres a little green bush with red flowers. A little bit more of the sap green and ooh theres a nice one. Theres a nice one. Lets start working in layers"
Bob Ross,"I tell you what, I tell you what, we need a way to get out there. Shoot, if you had a nice place like that youd have to get out there and catch a big ole fish that lives out there"
Bob Ross,Lets take a little Van Dyke brown on the knife. There we are. And lets go right in here. And lets put the indication of a little path. Just a little path. And put a little brown down
Bob Ross,So youd have to have a way to get out here. A little bit of brown and white for the highlight. Let the paint break. Barely barely touch the canvas. Just caress it
Bob Ross,"And in back to our one inch brush that has the highlight colors on it. A little green, a little yellow, Indian yellow, yellow ochre, all those nice colors. Load a lot of paint in there though"
Bob Ross,"And right here, choo, there it is. See, by loading a lot of paint, you just barely have to touch the canvas"
Bob Ross,If you had just a little paint in there you really gotta sock it hard to try to get the paint to come out. And then it mushes together. Thats a word my son uses
Bob Ross,"It mushes together and you end up with mud. And were not looking for that. Were not looking for that. Tell you what, get a new brush for the one down below. Well take white"
Bob Ross,"Liquid white, and well go into the titanium white. Be right back. I wanna get the least little touch of alizarin crimson. Ooh, thats nice. Gave it a little pinkish flavor. Lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can come back in here and do the same thing basically. Using a little bit of the white. There, all right. But look at all those little doers, little snow covered things"
Bob Ross,"Now back to our knife. Take a little titanium white. We need a little path in there too. But the same thing, it needs something to go over the path. See, now it pushes it right down into the painting"
Bob Ross,"Just like that. Now then, well take a fan brush. A little liquid white, a little titanium white, and a little touch of the phthalo blue. And with that, well come back in here"
Bob Ross,"Put the indications, some little highlights on these evergreen trees. There we go. Darker, darker, darker down toward the bottom though"
Bob Ross,"You know, one other group of people I would like to thank for making the Joy of Painting what it is, I think we have one of the best crews here of any PBS station in the nation"
Bob Ross,"Right here in Muncie Indiana. And Id like to thank all these people. The director, the producers, everybody for making this such a success. Because without these people, there wouldnt be anything"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put a little green on the brush here. And not only are these people such fantastic people in television, theyre also my friends. And theyve become very special to me"
Bob Ross,"Very very special to me. There we go. Now, lets just take a clean knife in here and there. Ill go back. Scrape in some sticks and twigs. Down here in this nice little winter one, same thing"
Bob Ross,"Little twigs and sticks will still be there. Theyd be a little colder down here but theyd be here. Now then, tell you what lets do"
Bob Ross,"I think were to the point, lets see if we can get all this off and see what we have. Now down here is just contact paper. And heres just a piece I have left over. Well take that off"
Bob Ross,"See, that was painted black. And well come right here. There, well its so hard to grab hold of. Well get it. Whoops. Well maybe its gonna come off, maybe its not"
Bob Ross,"Let me grab the knife, maybe I can get into. Lets do this one. There, take that off. Now theres some little pieces of tape right here that I wanna take off. See, and I left that white"
Bob Ross,But you sorta have to plan this before you do it. So you get all these little pieces of tape in the right place. And itll make it look like theres a little border around here. There we go. See there
Bob Ross,And it sorta looks like theres two paintings overlapping each other. And its sort of different. It gives it sort of almost like a graphic appearance. But its very neat
Bob Ross,"Give it a try, I think youll enjoy it. I think well sign that one or those since theres two of them. Take a little of the red and lets sign it right here. I really hope youve enjoyed this"
Bob Ross,Its a little different. And well sign this one up here. Well have two signatures on this one. I really hope youve enjoyed it. It is a little different
Bob Ross,"And from all of us here, from the whole staff of the station Id like to wish you happy painting. God bless, I look forward to seeing you the next series. Take care my friend. instrumental music"
Bob Ross,"HELLO. IM BOB ROSS, AND ID LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TO THE TWENTIETH JOY OF PAINTING SERIES"
Bob Ross,"SON OF A GUN, ITS HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THIS IS THE TWENTIETH SERIES, BUT IT IS, AND ID LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME BACK FOR ANOTHER SERIES OF PAINTING SHOWS"
Bob Ross,"IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME WITH US, LET ME EXTEND A PERSONAL INVITATION FOR YOU TO DRAG OUT YOUR BRUSHES AND YOUR PAINTS AND PAINT ALONG WITH US EACH SHOW. I THINK YOULL ENJOY IT"
Bob Ross,"TELL YOU WHAT, LETS START OUT TODAY AND HAVE THEM RUN ALL THE COLORS ACROSS THE SCREEN THAT YOU NEED TO PAINT ALONG WITH ME, AND I THINK WELL JUST DO A HAPPY LITTLE PICTURE TODAY"
Bob Ross,SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IVE GOT DONE UP HERE
Bob Ross,"WE HAVE OUR STANDARD OLD 18 x 24 INCH CANVAS, BUT YOU USE WHATEVER SIZE YOU WANT, AND WE HAVE IT COVERED WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LIQUID WHITE, JUST A THIN, EVEN COAT, JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE CANVAS WET"
Bob Ross,"AND WITH THAT, WELL JUST TAKE OFF AND WELL HAVE A SUPER TIME"
Bob Ross,"TO START TODAY I THINK ILL USE A LITTLE ONE-INCH BRUSH AND WELL GO INTO A VERY, VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THE PHTHALO BLUE, JUST A LITTLE BIT"
Bob Ross,"DONT WANT MUCH, AND LETS MAKE SOME--LETS MAKE SOME HAPPY LITTLE CLOUDS IN OUR WORLD. LETS COME RIGHT UP HERE. AND WELL JUST TAKE THIS BRUSH AND WELL JUST BOUNCE IN SOME NICE SHAPES"
Bob Ross,"NOW, WHEN WERE DOING THIS, WERE INTERESTED IN THE WHITE AREA, NOT THE DARK, SO DONT WORRY ABOUT THE DARK AREA. WERE GOING TO BLEND THAT ALL OUT"
Bob Ross,"ALL WERE DOING IS PUTTING IN SOME COLOR FOR THE SHADOWS OF OUR CLOUDS. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE NICEST, EASIEST WAYS OF MAKING VERY EFFECTIVE, GREAT BIG OLD CLOUDS. THERE"
Bob Ross,"SEE, BUT WERE INTERESTED IN THIS WHITE AREA, ONCE AGAIN. MAYBE THERES ANOTHER LITTLE CLOUD THAT LIVES, IN OUR WORLD, RIGHT ALONG THERE"
Bob Ross,"WHEREVER YOU THINK THEY SHOULD BE, THEN THATS EXACTLY WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. JUST WHEREVER, AND JUST USE THE OLD LITTLE ONE-INCH BRUSH, AND IM MAKING TINY LITTLE CIRCLES, JUST TINY LITTLE CIRCLES"
Bob Ross,"THERE WE ARE. OK. MAYBE ILL ADD A LITTLE COLOR RIGHT IN HERE TOO, JUST SO THERELL BE A LITTLE COLOR AT THE BASE OF THIS CLOUD. THERE. NOW THEN. LETS TAKE OUR LITTLE BRUSH"
Bob Ross,"THIS IS A TWO-INCH BRUSH, AND GO RIGHT UP IN HERE, AND VERY GENTLY--IM USING JUST THE CORNER OF THE BRUSH--WELL MAKE LITTLE ROUND CIRCLE PATTERNS HERE, JUST SORT OF WIND IT UP, BLEND IT TOGETHER"
Bob Ross,"ALLOW IT TO BLEND WITH THE WHITE THATS ALREADY ON THE CANVAS, AND THATS THE JOY OF THIS WET-ON-WET PAINTING TECHNIQUE"
Bob Ross,"THE FACT THAT ITS WET ALLOWS YOU TO BLEND COLOR RIGHT ON THE CANVAS, RIGHT ON THE CANVAS. THERE WE GO. NOW ITS BEGINNING TO MAKE A LITTLE SENSE"
Bob Ross,SEE HOW THOSE DARK AREAS END UP BEING THE NICE SHADOWS. AND THE WHITE AREAS WILL END UP BEING OUR CLOUDS
Bob Ross,"THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO MAKE CLOUDS FOR SEASCAPE PAINTINGS, THESE GREAT BIG FLUFFY CLOUDS, WORKS VERY NICE. THERE WE ARE. NOW THEN, WHILE WE HAVE THIS OLD BRUSH DIRTY, TELL YOU WHAT LETS DO"
Bob Ross,"LETS GO BACK INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT PHTHALO BLUE. PHTHALO BLUE IS A VERY NICE COLOR. ITS VERY WARM BLUE. I LIKE THAT. JUST A LITTLE COLOR ON THE BRUSH. OK, LETS GO BACK UP HERE"
Bob Ross,"LETS HAVE SOME WATER IN THIS PAINTING. IF YOUVE PAINTED WITH ME BEFORE, YOU KNOW IM A FANATIC FOR WATER. I LOVE WATER. AND ITS ONE OF THE NICEST, EASIEST THINGS TO PAINT IN THIS TECHNIQUE"
Bob Ross,"AND TODAY, MAYBE THIS ONE WILL BE STILL WATER, SO WE WANT THESE LINES TO BE BASICALLY STRAIGHT ACROSS HERE. BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, STILL WATER IS ALWAYS FLAT, ALWAYS LEVEL. THERE"
Bob Ross,"NOW JUST VERY LIGHTLY, GO ALL THE WAY ACROSS, AND SORT OF BRING IT TOGETHER, AND THAT LIGHT AREA HERE, ITLL REMAIN IN THERE. THERE"
Bob Ross,"OK, NOW, THE MOST FUN PART OF THIS WHOLE TECHNIQUE IS WASHING THE BRUSH, SO LETS DO THAT. WE WASH OUR BRUSHES WITH ODORLESS THINNER. SHAKE OFF THE EXCESS. AND JUST BEAT THE DEVIL OUT OF IT"
Bob Ross,THIS IS WHERE YOU TAKE OUT ALL YOUR FRUSTRATIONS AND HOSTILITIES AND JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME. LETS GO INTO A LITTLE TITANIUM WHITE. WELL USE THE OLD FAN BRUSH. WELL MAKE SOME LITTLE CLOUDS
Bob Ross,"ILL BE RIGHT BACK. LET ME GRAB A LEAST LITTLE TOUCH OF THE BRIGHT RED. JUST ENOUGH, A LITTLE BIT MORE. THERE. JUST ENOUGH TO PUT A LITTLE PINKISH GLOW INTO OUR LITTLE CLOUDS. WE DONT WANT MUCH"
Bob Ross,"DONT WANT MUCH. OK, LETS GO UP HERE. NOW WEVE GOT TO MAKE BIG DECISIONS. WELL JUST USE THIS BRUSH AND DECIDE WHERE OUR LITTLE CLOUDS LIVE. AND WE JUST COME ALONG HERE AND SORT OF DROP THEM IN"
Bob Ross,THIS ALSO WORKS VERY WELL WITH A LITTLE ONE-INCH BRUSH. VERY WELL. EITHER WAY THAT YOU WANT TO DO IT. EITHER WAY
Bob Ross,"IF YOU HAVENT PAINTED WITH US BEFORE, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TRY TO DO HERE, WE TRY NOT TO TEACH YOU JUST TO COPY. ALL WERE TRYING TO DO IS TEACH YOU A TECHNIQUE AND TURN YOU LOOSE ON THE WORLD"
Bob Ross,"WE USE NO PATTERNS, NO TRACINGS. ALL WE DO IS JUST SORT OF HAVE AN IDEA IN OUR MIND, AND WE JUST SORT OF LET IT HAPPEN"
Bob Ross,"AND IF YOULL PRACTICE THIS A LITTLE BIT, VERY SOON YOU CAN ENJOY THE FREEDOM OF CREATING A PAINTING, RIGHT ON THE CANVAS. RIGHT ON THE CANVAS, AND TO ME, THATS WHERE IT REALLY BECOMES FUN"
Bob Ross,"ITS WHEN YOU CAN JUST LITERALLY CREATE A PAINTING RIGHT ON THE CANVAS AS YOURE WORKING ON IT. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOURE DOING, AND YOULL SEE THINGS"
Bob Ross,"THEYLL JUST SORT OF HAPPEN, AND YOU LEARN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHATEVER HAPPENS AND USE IT TO MAKE YOUR PAINTING SPECIAL, AND YOU CAN DO THAT. OK"
Bob Ross,"LETS GO BACK, GET OUR OLD TWO-INCH BRUSH, AND I JUST WANT TO NOW BLEND ALL THAT TOGETHER. JUST BLEND IT TOGETHER. IM BEING CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH THESE TOP EDGES YET"
Bob Ross,"IM JUST BLENDING THE BLUE AND THE WHITE DOWN HERE TOGETHER, VERY GENTLY, STILL USING LITTLE CIRCULAR STROKES. THERE WE GO. JUST SORT OF LET THAT MIX TOGETHER"
Bob Ross,"IM GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THE TOP, BUT IM TRYING NOT TO TOUCH IT AT THIS POINT. VERY CLOSE BUT NOT TOUCHING. THERE. A LITTLE BIT UP IN HERE, SEE. JUST SORT OF BLEND IT TOGETHER"
Bob Ross,"MIX IT UP, JUST LIKE YOURE MAKING A CAKE OR SOMETHING, JUST MIX IT UP. A LITTLE BIT IN HERE, LIKE THAT. OK, GOOD"
Bob Ross,"BUT THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL WAY-- I JUST BEAT THE BRUSH LIKE THAT TO KNOCK OFF EXCESS PAINT. ITS A BEAUTIFUL WAY TO CREATE VERY EFFECTIVE, BIG, FLUFFY CLOUDS. NOW WERE JUST SORT OF LIFTING IT UP"
Bob Ross,"THIS WILL BLEND IT ALL TOGETHER, SMOOTH IT OUT. THERE. SEE THERE. AND THEN, VERY LIGHTLY, TWO HAIRS AND SOME AIR, JUST GENTLY, GENTLY, GENTLY, BLEND THE ENTIRE SKY"
Bob Ross,"AND WITH THAT, SHOOT, WE HAVE A PRETTY NICE-LOOKING LITTLE SKY. AND THERE WASNT ANYTHING TO IT. NOW THEN, LETS GET CRAZY. LETS TAKE--WELL USE SOME MIDNIGHT BLACK, A LITTLE PRUSSIAN BLUE"
Bob Ross,"NOW PRUSSIAN BLUE IS MUCH DARKER THAN PHTHALO BLUE. ITS STRONG--WHOO-- VERY STRONG COLOR. WELL PUT SOME VAN DYKE BROWN AND A LITTLE ALIZARIN CRIMSON IN THERE, TOO"
Bob Ross,"BUT WERE LOOKING FOR A VERY DARK COLOR. IT SHOULD LOOK BLACK. PULL IT OUT AS FLAT AS YOU CAN GET IT, GO STRAIGHT DOWN WITH THE KNIFE, AND WELL JUST CUT OFF A LITTLE ROLL OF PAINT. THERE IT IS"
Bob Ross,ITS RIGHT OUT ON THE EDGE OF THE KNIFE. LETS GO UP HERE. NOW I WANT TO MAKE SOME TINY LITTLE MOUNTAINS UP IN HERE THAT ARE FAR AWAY
Bob Ross,"I DONT WANT THESE TO BE VERY BIG, BECAUSE WE WANT TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF DISTANCE HERE. USING A VERY FIRM PRESSURE, JUST LITERALLY PUSH THIS RIGHT INTO THE FABRIC"
Bob Ross,"AND I DONT WANT A LOT OF MOUNTAINS TODAY, THATS ABOUT ALL WE NEED. WITH THE TWO-INCH BRUSH, I WANT TO GRAB THIS AND PULL IT, JUST PULL IT"
Bob Ross,"AND WHEN WERE PAINTING MOUNTAINS, AS YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS WANT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN TO BE MORE DISTINCT THAN THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN, BECAUSE AT THE BOTTOM WE HAVE MIST AND NOW WE HAVE"
Bob Ross,"WONDERFUL POLLUTION, AND WE HAVE ALL THESE THINGS THAT BREAK UP AND DIFFUSE LIGHT, AND IT CREATES THIS SOFTNESS AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN. LETS GO INTO A LITTLE TITANIUM WHITE. WHAT THE HECK"
Bob Ross,"VERY SMALL AMOUNT. GET A VERY, VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF PAINT ON THE KNIFE. NOW THEN, BARELY TOUCHING, NO PRESSURE, NO PRESSURE. AND I DONT WANT THIS TO BE VERY DISTINCT"
Bob Ross,"I WANT THIS TO BE VERY QUIET, SUBDUED, FAR AWAY, GENTLE, SOFT. THINK ABOUT THOSE TYPES OF WORDS AND STUFF WHEN YOURE PAINTING. ITLL HELP YOUR HAND GO MUCH MORE GENTLE. BUT VERY SOFT"
Bob Ross,"DONT WANT A LOT OF DETAIL IN THIS. AND WELL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF BLUE AND WHITE, AND JUST THE INDICATION OF SOME SHADOW. DONT EVEN WANT A LOT OF SHADOW BACK HERE"
Bob Ross,"WITH A CLEAN, DRY BRUSH, FOLLOWING THE ANGLES--ALWAYS FOLLOW THOSE ANGLES--GOING TO VERY GENTLY, VERY GENTLY TAP IT AND THEN LIFT IT UPWARD, AND THATLL HELP, ALSO, CREATE THAT ILLUSION OF MIST AT THE"
Bob Ross,"BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN. SHOOT. LETS GET CRAZY. FIND ANOTHER ONE-INCH BRUSH, OR YOU COULD USE YOUR FAN BRUSH, WHATEVER. TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE TITANIUM WHITE"
Bob Ross,"MAYBE IN OUR WORLD, MAYBE THIS OLD CLOUD RIGHT HERE, IT JUST SORT OF DRIFTS RIGHT DOWN IN FRONT OF THE MOUNTAIN, SO JUST A LITTLE WHITE, LITTLE CIRCLES, TINY LITTLE CIRCLES. SHOOT"
Bob Ross,"MAYBE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE. I DONT KNOW, I DONT KNOW, JUST SORT OF LOOK AT YOUR PAINTING AND MAKE A DECISION. MAYBE IT JUST SORT OF WRAPS THIS OLD MOUNTAIN UP"
Bob Ross,WELL TAKE A TWO-INCH BRUSH AND JUST BLEND IT TOGETHER. THIS IS A SUPER WAY OF MAKING MOUNTAINS THAT LOOK LIKE THEYRE JUST LAYING OUT HERE IN THE MIST
Bob Ross,"I LIVED IN ALASKA FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, AND YOU SEE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENERY THERE. GOD WAS HAVING A GOOD DAY WHEN HE MADE ALASKA. BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL. THERE"
Bob Ross,"SEE, THAT OLD MOUNTAIN JUST LAYS UP THERE IN THE MIST NOW AND FLOATS AROUND. HAS A GOOD TIME ALL DAY. NOW THEN, MAYBE WELL HAVE SOME LITTLE FOOTHILLS BACK THERE. I LIKE TO DO LITTLE FOOTHILLS"
Bob Ross,"AND WELL TAKE SOME OF THAT SAME MOUNTAIN COLOR, ADD THE LEAST LITTLE TOUCH OF SAP GREEN TO IT-- A LITTLE SAP GREEN. THERE WE ARE, BUT ITS PREDOMINANTLY BLUE"
Bob Ross,"THE ONE THATS FARTHEST AWAY HERE, WELL MAKE PREDOMINANTLY BLUE. OK, LET ME WIPE MY KNIFE OFF. AND LETS USE--WELL USE THE ONE-INCH BRUSH. WHAT THE HECK"
Bob Ross,"YOU COULD USE YOUR FAN BRUSH OR A TWO-INCH BRUSH. IT DOESNT MATTER. LOAD A LITTLE COLOR IN THERE, AND LETS GO RIGHT UP IN HERE. NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE A BIG DECISION. WHERE DO OUR LITTLE FOOTHILLS LIVE"
Bob Ross,"MAYBE WELL HAVE ONE COMING RIGHT OVER HERE. WELL START THIS ONE OUT BACK HERE, JUST USING THE CORNER OF THE BRUSH, AND PULLING STRAIGHT DOWN, GENTLY"
Bob Ross,MAYBE THE LITTLE FOOTHILL COMES RIGHT OVER LIKE THAT. WHEREVER
Bob Ross,"ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY INDIVIDUAL THING, PAINTING IS, SO JUST SORT OF LOOK AT IT AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND HOW YOU WANT YOUR PAINTING TO BE"
Bob Ross,"NOW THEN, WHEN YOURE DOING FOOTHILLS, ESPECIALLY LAYERS OF FOOTHILLS, YOU WANT A LITTLE MISTY AREA IN BETWEEN. THATS YOUR SEPARATOR"
Bob Ross,"SO TAKE THE BRUSH, TWO-INCH BRUSH, AND JUST TAP THE BASE OF IT, AND YOU CAN TAP QUITE FIRMLY"
Bob Ross,"WHEN YOURE DOING LANDSCAPES, EACH LAYER, EACH PLANE, AS IT COMES CLOSER TO YOU, SHOULD GET DARKER IN VALUE, SO WELL USE THAT SAME COLOR, AND ILL JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT OF THAT MOUNTAIN COLOR--SEE,"
Bob Ross,"ITS RIGHT HERE--ILL JUST ADD A LITTLE OF THAT INTO IT. THATLL MAKE IT A LITTLE DARKER, MAYBE A TOUCH MORE OF THE GREEN. THERE WE GO. OK"
Bob Ross,"NOW MAYBE, OVER HERE, WELL HOLD THE BRUSH UP LIKE THIS, AND THATLL MAKE TOPS THAT ARE A LITTLE TALLER AND A LITTLE MORE DISTINCT, BECAUSE THEYRE GETTING A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOU. THERE"
Bob Ross,"BUT YOU CAN CREATE JUST LAYER AFTER LAYER AFTER LAYER LIKE THIS, AND IT ENHANCES YOUR PAINTING TREMENDOUSLY BECAUSE IT CREATES THAT ILLUSION OF DEPTH"
Bob Ross,"BACK TO OUR TWO-INCH BRUSH, AND ONCE AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN, WE WANT TO CREATE THAT MIST. SEE HOW THAT MIST IN BETWEEN SEPARATES. ITS YOUR BEST FRIEND. TAKE CARE OF IT. TAKE CARE OF IT. THERE WE GO"
Bob Ross,"NOW LIFT UPWARD. AND MAYBE--ILL TELL YOU WHAT LETS HAVE ONE MORE. LETS HAVE ONE MORE. IM ADDING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT DARK COLOR, RIGHT INTO THAT SAME ORIGINAL PILE, ONE MORE"
Bob Ross,"AND THEN MAYBE IT LIVES RIGHT HERE, BUT ITS DARKER IN VALUE. ITS A LITTLE DARKER. THERE WE GO, AND WELL LET HIM COME MAYBE RIGHT DOWN IN HERE. I DONT KNOW. THERE"
Bob Ross,"BUT EACH LAYER, EACH LAYER NEEDS TO GET DARKER IN VALUE TO KEEP THAT FEELING OF DISTANCE IN THE PAINTING. AND I KNOW I REPEAT THAT OVER AND OVER, BUT ITS SO IMPORTANT, SO IMPORTANT"
Bob Ross,"YOU DONT WANT JUST A FLAT OLD PAINTING. SHOOT. WE WANT A MASTERPIECE HERE, AND YOU CAN DO THAT. ONCE AGAIN, WERE GOING TO TAP THAT BASE, JUST LIKE SO. VERY LIGHTLY, LIFT IT UPWARD. THERE"
Bob Ross,"MAYBE WERE BEGINNING TO GET DOWN HERE TO WHERE THERE ARE A FEW REFLECTIONS, SO WELL TAKE A LITTLE PAINT ON THE TWO-INCH BRUSH, GRAB IT, AND PULL IT STRAIGHT DOWN"
Bob Ross,"ITS MOST IMPORTANT THAT THESE REFLECTIONS COME STRAIGHT DOWN. MOST IMPORTANT. IF YOU GO AT AN ANGLE LIKE THIS, IT WONT LOOK RIGHT, SEE, EVEN THERE, IT DOESNT LOOK RIGHT"
Bob Ross,"NOW VERY LIGHTLY, GO ACROSS, VERY, VERY LIGHTLY. JUST ENOUGH TO BLEND IT AND GIVE IT THE FEELING OF WATER. ITS ONE OF THE NICEST THINGS ABOUT THIS TECHNIQUE. ITS INSTANT REFLECTIONS"
Bob Ross,"NOW THEN, IM GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE OF THE LIQUID WHITE, PUT THE LEAST LITTLE TOUCH OF THE BRIGHT RED IN IT, JUST THE LEAST LITTLE TOUCH, JUST ENOUGH TO FLAVOR IT A LITTLE BIT"
Bob Ross,"BE CAREFUL, BECAUSE VERY QUICKLY, THIS CAN GET REALLY INTENSE IN COLOR. NOW WELL JUST CUT ACROSS. THATS ALL THERE IS TO IT"
Bob Ross,"GO UP HERE, AND WELL JUST PUT IN JUST THE INDICATION OF A HAPPY LITTLE WATER LINE THAT LIVES HERE. NOW IF YOU GET ONE THATS MAYBE A LITTLE TOO STRONG OR TOO BRIGHT, JUST GO BACK AND RUB IT"
Bob Ross,"THE MORE YOU RUB IT, THE LIGHTER ITLL GET, BECAUSE ITLL JUST BE ABSORBED RIGHT INTO THE COLOR THATS UNDERNEATH. NO BIG DEAL"
Bob Ross,"AND IF YOUVE PAINTED WITH ME BEFORE, YOU KNOW WITHOUT QUESTION THAT WE DONT MAKE MISTAKES HERE, WE JUST HAVE HAPPY ACCIDENTS. BUT YOU LEARN TO USE ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS"
Bob Ross,"OK, MAYBE, RIGHT THERE, AND LITTLE RIPPLES, BUT NOTICE HOW ALL THESE LINES ARE BASICALLY STRAIGHT"
Bob Ross,"IF THEYRE NOT, ITS GOING TO LOOK LIKE YOUR WATERS GOING TO RUN RIGHT OUT OF YOUR PAINTING AND GET YOUR FLOOR WET, AND YOULL HAVE TO TIE A BUCKET ON ONE SIDE. WE DONT WANT YOU TO HAVE TO DO THAT"
Bob Ross,"NOW. TELL YOU WHAT, CLEAN OFF A LITTLE SPOT. LETS TAKE--LETS TAKE SOME BLACK, PRUSSIAN BLUE, BROWN, CRIMSON, SAP GREEN, ALL THOSE SAME COLORS, BUT WITH NO WHITE IN IT. ITS VERY, VERY DARK"
Bob Ross,"VERY DARK. LOOKS BLACK ON THE PALETTE. THERE. OK, LET ME CLEAN MY KNIFE, AND I JUST WIPE THE KNIFE ON AN OLD PAPER TOWEL. FIND A FAN BRUSH HERE. LETS TAKE THE FAN BRUSH AND GO RIGHT INTO THAT COLOR"
Bob Ross,"LOAD A LOT OF PAINT ONTO THE BRUSH, BOTH SIDES. SEE THE BRISTLES. THERES A LOT OF PAINT IN THERE. OK, LETS GO UP HERE"
Bob Ross,"MAYBE BACK IN HERE IN OUR WORLD THERE LIVES--WELL, THERE DOES NOW ANYWAY--THERE LIVES A HAPPY LITTLE EVERGREEN TREE"
Bob Ross,"AND WE JUST USE THE CORNER OF THE BRUSH, JUST THE CORNER, AND AS YOU WORK DOWN THE TREE, ADD MORE AND MORE PRESSURE SO THE BRISTLES BEND DOWNWARD MUCH, MUCH MORE. LOOK THERE"
Bob Ross,"ISNT THAT A NICE WAY TO MAKE A HAPPY LITTLE EVERGREEN. LETS GIVE HIM A FRIEND. YOU KNOW ME, I THINK EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A FRIEND. FRIENDS ARE SO IMPORTANT. THERE. ALL RIGHT"
Bob Ross,"MAYBE--SHOOT. IN OUR WORLD, MAYBE THERES 3 TREES HERE. YOU CAN PUT AS MANY OR AS FEW AS YOU WANT. THE ONLY THING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO TEACH YOU HERE IS HOW TO MAKE A TREE"
Bob Ross,YOU DECIDE HOW MANY TREES YOU HAVE IN YOUR WORLD. MAYBE WELL HAVE SOME--MAYBE THERES A LITTLE REFLECTION DOWN HERE. JUST PUT SOME GENERAL SHAPES
Bob Ross,"WERE NOT LOOKING FOR DETAIL, NOT LOOKING FOR DETAIL, JUST VERY BASIC LITTLE SHAPES. SHOOT. WHO KNOWS. MAYBE THERES SOME LAND THERE, TOO"
Bob Ross,"YOU CAN JUST PUSH UP WITH THE FAN BRUSH AND A LITTLE BIT DOWN FOR THE REFLECTION, AND LETS TAKE--WELL USE OLD TWO-INCH BRUSH, AND GRAB THIS, DECIDE WHERE WATER AND LAND MEET, AND PULL STRAIGHT DOWN"
Bob Ross,"ONCE AGAIN, STRAIGHT DOWN. SON OF A GUN, INSTANT REFLECTIONS. GO ACROSS, AND THAT EASY, THAT EASY, AND SEE, THESE REFLECTIONS, YOU CAN PUSH THEM. SEE HOW YOU CAN PUSH THEM"
Bob Ross,"BECAUSE THE CANVAS IS WET YOU CAN DO THAT. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING HERE. ON THIS CANVAS, YOU HAVE TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE POWER, UNLIMITED POWER HERE"
Bob Ross,"WHEN I GO HOME, ONLY THING I CAN DO IS TAKE THE GARBAGE OUT. BUT HERE, I CAN DO ANYTHING THAT I WANT TO DO"
Bob Ross,"LETS TAKE A LITTLE OF THE DARK SIENNA AND A LITTLE WHITE, GET A LITTLE ROLL OF PAINT ON THE KNIFE, AND LETS PUT A LITTLE INDICATION HERE AND THERE OF A LITTLE TREE TRUNK THAT LIVES IN THESE. THERE"
Bob Ross,"DONT WANT A GREAT DEAL, DONT WANT A GREAT DEAL, JUST ENOUGH TO INDICATE THERES SOMETHING IN THERE"
Bob Ross,"AND YOU CAN JUST TAKE THE POINT OF THE KNIFE, JUST SCRAPE THROUGH, AND MAKE LITTLE LINES AND STICKS AND ALL THOSE LITTLE THINGS. TELL YOU WHAT, LET ME GRAB ANOTHER FAN BRUSH"
Bob Ross,"I HAVE SEVERAL OF THEM GOING HERE, AND LETS TAKE AND GO INTO A LITTLE YELLOW. THIS IS CAD YELLOW, LITTLE TOUCH OF THAT COLOR THAT WE MADE THE TREE OUT OF"
Bob Ross,"SINCE IT HAS BLUE IN IT, SOON AS WE TOUCH THE YELLOW, TURNS BEAUTIFUL GREEN COLOR. MAYBE A LITTLE YELLOW OCHRE, TOO. I WANT A DARK GREEN HERE. ONCE AGAIN, LOAD THE BRISTLES QUITE FULL. A LOT OF COLOR"
Bob Ross,"LETS GO UP HERE. NOW THEN, LETS PUT SOME HIGHLIGHTS ON THESE LITTLE TREES. DONT WANT TO OVERDO. IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH HIGHLIGHTS ON HERE, TOO MANY HIGHLIGHTS, THEN IT LOSES ITS EFFECTIVENESS"
Bob Ross,"I WANT THESE TO BE QUITE DARK. LOOK THERE. AND THATS ALL THERE IS TO IT, DARKER, DARKER, DARKER"
Bob Ross,"NOW MAYBE DOWN HERE THERES SOME LITTLE GRASSY THINGS THAT GROW ON THIS, AND YOU CAN JUST MAKE THOSE BY PUSHING UP WITH THE BRUSH, THATS ALL. VERY EASY. NOW, LETS HAVE SOME LAND UNDER THERE"
Bob Ross,"WE NEED SOMETHING TO HOLD THOSE TREES UP SO THEY DONT FALL OVER IN THE WATER AND MAKE A BIG SPLASH. THERE. LITTLE VAN DYKE BROWN, LITTLE DARK SIENNA MIXED TOGETHER, LIKE SO"
Bob Ross,"WELL TAKE A LITTLE TOUCH OF THAT BROWN AND WHITE, JUST MAKE THE INDICATION OF A LITTLE LAND THERE. LITTLE BIT OF THE LIQUID WHITE THAT WE HAD LEFT OVER, AND WELL JUST PUT IN A LITTLE WATER LINE"
Bob Ross,"THIS WATER LINE IS YOUR SEPARATOR. ITS A LIGHT BETWEEN TWO DARKS, AND THAT SEPARATES IT, MAKES IT STAND OUT. ALL RIGHT. TELL YOU WHAT. WELL JUST USE THIS BIG BRUSH. READY TO HAVE SOME FUN"
Bob Ross,"IF YOUVE PAINTED WITH ME BEFORE, YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE TO MAKE BIG TREES, SO LETS DO THAT. ILL USE THE OLD TWO-INCH BRUSH TODAY. THE OLD TWO-INCH BRUSH"
Bob Ross,"SO OFTEN WE AVOID THIS BRUSH BECAUSE ITS BIG AND WERE AFRAID OF IT. A LOT OF PAINT, WIGGLE, WIGGLE, WIGGLE, THEN SHARPEN IT JUST LIKE YOU WOULD A KNIFE. LOOK HOW SHARP THIS BRUSH IS"
Bob Ross,"THERE, YOU CAN SEE, ITS VERY SHARP. OK, LETS GO UP HERE. NOW THEN. MAYBE IN OUR WORLD LIVES A BIG EVERGREEN TREE, RIGHT THERE. JUST TOUCH THE CANVAS"
Bob Ross,"NOW WE USE JUST THE CORNER, JUST THE CORNER OF THE BRUSH, AND JUST GO BACK AND FORTH, AND BEGIN LAYING IN ALL OF THESE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE LIMBS AND STUFF THAT LIVE HERE ON THIS TREE. THERE. OK"
Bob Ross,"TELL YOU WHAT, WELL HAVE ANOTHER ONE. YOU KNEW THAT, DIDNT YOU. YOU KNEW ID HAVE A FRIEND OUT HERE. THERE. OK"
Bob Ross,"NOW THEN, LETS HAVE SOME, MAYBE THERES SOME BIG LEAFY TREES, NOT EVERGREENS, THAT LIVE HERE. THERE. LETS JUST PUSH IN SOME NICE LEAF AND BRANCH SHAPES. LOOK THERE"
Bob Ross,"BUT WHEN YOU USE A BIG BRUSH, YOU CAN DO THIS VERY RAPIDLY. NOW LETS GO ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE NEED SOME OVER HERE, TOO. NOW, YOU COULD DO THIS WITH A ONE-INCH BRUSH IF YOU WANTED TO"
Bob Ross,"IT WORKS JUST AS WELL. JUST AS WELL. THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT FASTER. A LITTLE BIT FASTER. THERE WE ARE. OK. JUST BRING IT RIGHT ON DOWN, RIGHT ON DOWN. NOW YOU HAVE TO START MAKING BIG DECISIONS"

Bob Ross,"IF YOU WANT THIS SHRUBBERY AND BUSHES AND TREES TO COME ALL THE WAY ACROSS, THEN DO IT, DO IT. ALL RIGHT"
Bob Ross,"NOW THEN, WE CAN JUST TAKE A CLEAN KNIFE AND JUST MAKE THE INDICATION OF LITTLE STICKS AND TWIGS JUST BY SCRAPING, JUST THE POINT OF THE KNIFE"
Bob Ross,"WERE GOING TO COVER MOST OF THOSE UP, BUT SOME OF THEM WILL SHOW"
Bob Ross,"WE COULD EVEN USE A LITTLE BROWN AND WHITE, COME RIGHT UP IN HERE, PUT THE INDICATION OF A TRUNK, NOT A GREAT DEAL OF DETAIL, JUST A LITTLE"
Bob Ross,"LITTLE OVER HERE BECAUSE THESE ARE GOING TO BE DEEP IN THE OLD TREE HERE. YOURE NOT GOING TO SEE MUCH OF THEM, BUT THEYRE THERE"
Bob Ross,"NOW THEN, LETS TAKE--IM GOING TO DIP THE BRUSH INTO A LITTLE OF THE LIQUID WHITE, ONE-INCH BRUSH. WELL GO RIGHT THROUGH. ILL USE A LITTLE CAD YELLOW, GRAB SOME SAP GREEN UP HERE. THERE WE ARE"
Bob Ross,"CAD YELLOW, SAP GREEN, PULL THE BRUSH IN ONE DIRECTION. LOAD A LOT OF COLOR IN IT. OK, LETS GO UP HERE"
Bob Ross,"NOW THEN, THINK ABOUT ALL YOUR LITTLE LEAVES AND STUFF HERE THAT WOULD JUST SHINE AND, OH, THEY WOULD SPARKLE OUT HERE IN THE SUN UNDER THIS BIG MOUNTAIN"
Bob Ross,"AND WHEN YOURE PAINTING, MAKE UP LITTLE STORIES. THINK ABOUT THE SCENE THAT YOURE PAINTING. BECOME PART OF IT. MAKE FRIENDS WITH A TREE. SHOOT, YOU CAN JUST DROP ALL THIS STUFF IN. AND LET IT GO"
Bob Ross,"DARKER, DARKER, DARKER AS YOU WORK DOWN TOWARD THE BASE OF THE TREE, THOUGH. DARKER, DARKER"
Bob Ross,"ADD A LITTLE YELLOW OCHRE HERE AND THERE, A LITTLE INDIAN YELLOW, SOMETIMES JUST TO CHANGE THE FLAVOR, WHEREVER YOU WANT THEM. THERE WE ARE. A LITTLE TOUCH OF BRIGHT RED EVEN HERE AND THERE"
Bob Ross,"ITS UP TO YOU, UP TO YOU. THERE. AND YOU CHOOSE EVEN THE TIME OF YEAR. LETS GO ON THIS OTHER BIG TREE OVER HERE. MAYBE OVER HERE THERE LIVES-- THERE LIVES THIS BIG TREE"

Bob Ross,"DARKER, DARKER, DARKER DOWN HERE TOWARD THE BASE, MUCH DARKER. LETS HAVE A BUSH RIGHT HERE THAT HAS RED FLOWERS ON IT. LOOK AT THAT. SEE THERE"
Bob Ross,"JUST BY PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF RED ON THE END OF THE BRUSH, YOU CAN DO THAT. HERE LIVES ANOTHER ONE. JUST DO ONE BUSH AT A TIME, THOUGH. ONE AT A TIME. THERE THEY GO. OK. JUST WHEREVER YOU WANT THEM"
Bob Ross,"SHOOT. ITS COMING ALONG PRETTY NICE. THERE. OK. ON THE OTHER SIDE OVER HERE, AND WELL PUT IN SOME LITTLE BUSHES HERE, AND YOU CAN USE THE BRUSH SIDEWARDS"

Bob Ross,"WEVE GOT JUST A SECOND LEFT, SO ILL THROW THAT IN, A LITTLE BROWN AND WHITE, GIVE US THE INDICATION OF A LITTLE PATH"
Bob Ross,"THEN ALL WE NEED TO DO IS PUT A LITTLE BUSH OVER THE TOP OF IT, AND ITLL SET IT RIGHT DOWN INTO THE PAINTING. SHOOT. I THINK WE HAVE A FINISHED PAINTING"
Bob Ross,"WITH THAT, IM GOING TO WISH YOU HAPPY PAINTING, AND GOD BLESS, MY FRIEND. ILL SEE YOU NEXT SHOW"
