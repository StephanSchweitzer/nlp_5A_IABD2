Bob Ross,"If this is your first time with us, allow me to extend a personal invitation for you to drag out your paints and some big, ol unorthodox brushes and Ill show you how to do some fantastic little"
Bob Ross,"So Ill tell you what, today lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this little painting with us, and while theyre doing that let me show you what"
Bob Ross,"Ive gotten done up here. Today, Ive taken an 18 by 24, double prime, pre-stretch canvas and Ive just covered the entire canvas with black gesso"
Bob Ross,And black gesso is just an acrylic paint that makes the canvas black. Ive allowed that to dry completely
Bob Ross,"On top of that, take a little piece of contact paper here, any sticky back paper cut an oval, stuck it on there"
Bob Ross,"Then on the inside here, after we have the contact paper on, Ive taken a little bit of liquid clear and covered the entire inside"
Bob Ross,"Then weve taken alizarin crimson, just plain ol alizerin crimson covered the entire canvas"
Bob Ross,"And on the corner over here Ive put a little bit of phthalo blue, just so its sort of a lavender color over here. I know it sounds complicated but believe it or not it is extremely simple"
Bob Ross,"Black gesso, liquid clear, alizarin crimson, a little phthalo blue in the corner and just blend it out. And with that let me show you how much fun we can have"
Bob Ross,Lets start today with a least little bit of indian yellow. I just want a very small amount. Just a small amount. And Ill go right up in here and get a little bit of white on there
Bob Ross,So we have a little indian yellow and a little bit of titanium white on a little two inch brush. Lets go right up in here
Bob Ross,"Now, lets decide where our light area will be, and right in here lets start making little Xs, little criss cross strokes, something like that"
Bob Ross,"And we just begin letting that blend outward and upward. I want this to be the lightest area in my sky. So with that, all we have to do is start making little Xs"
Bob Ross,"I love these black canvasses because you put the transparent color on there, they still look black, but when you start painting you add a little white, or yellow or something in there, and they come"
Bob Ross,"alive. Notice that Im always taking the pure color back to the lightest area and working outward. That way we assure that the lightest color is right in there, and thats where we want it. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Look at all those beautiful colors, they just. they happen automatically. This is a very, very easy style of painting. Anybody can do this. I get letters everyday from people all over the country"
Bob Ross,"They say, I never believed I could paint, but Ive tried what you showed me on television and it works for me. It works.  Alright. Now I want to make that a little brighter yet"
Bob Ross,"So Im going to take some more of the titanium white and a little bit of canyon yellow, its very bright yellow, very strong yellow. Just a little"
Bob Ross,"Once again, always start in the lightest area and work outward, because youre gonna pick up this transparent color this on the canvas and automatically it will get darker and darker as you work away"
Bob Ross,from that center area. Something about like so. There. Well take the little blender brush and come back and smooth all that out in a second. In the meantime Im going to grab another brush
Bob Ross,"I have several of them going so I dont have to spend all my time just washing brushes. Take a little white and lets get crazy, shoot, lets get a little bit of this bright red"
Bob Ross,"Thats a gorgeous color but its very strong. Be careful with it. Just a tap a little into the bristles, thats all were doing, just tapping. And maybe up here now well. maybe. yep"
Bob Ross,"Theres some, just some happy little things that happen up here in the sky. Just little things like this, and well dance a few little colors in here"
Bob Ross,In your world you put any color or any shape that you want. Painting is a very individual thing. Everybody will see nature through different eyes and thats the beauty of it
Bob Ross,"You can paint any world that you want here. Any world that you want. Maybe theres a little dooer comes out here, I dont know, doesnt really matter. You decide"
Bob Ross,"Take a little blue, a little crimson, just mix them on the brush here. Make sort of a little lavender color but to the reddish side"
Bob Ross,"Now the blue is many, many times stronger than the crimson, so proportionately you need much, much more crimson than you do blue"
Bob Ross,"Then Im just gonna begin laying in some little colors under in here and wherever we want them. Just have fun with this, let it happen. Let it happen"
Bob Ross,"We dont do any drawings or tracings, we really learn to create here. We let our imagination take us to worlds we never knew existed, and in those worlds we find peace, we find happiness"
Bob Ross,"Good things happen here. Little blender brush, its a very soft brush. Very soft. Make a nice, nice makeup brush even"
Bob Ross,"But with that, because the paint we use here is very firm and very dry, very thick paint, we can take this little blender and go right over it. Just like that. Isnt that something. That easy"
Bob Ross,"There, we can just work on this a little, and the more you blend this the more it just goes right into those background colors and gorgeous things happen automatically. Automatically"
Bob Ross,"Put a little white paint on there, maybe well brighten that a little, right in there. I want that to stand out. Something about like that. Alright. Okay. Now that, its time to have some fun in here"
Bob Ross,"Lets get a little fan brush, take a fan brush. Im gonna mix up, well take some alizarin crimson, a little bit of the phthalo blue, maybe even put a little black in there. Like that"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna get a little titanium white. Im looking for sort of a. mmm. that color. That color right there. Sort of a grey, grey to the blue side. Okay. Let me wipe the knife off"
Bob Ross,"Let me just wipe the knife of a little paper towel. Take the fan brush, and well load both sides full of color just by going back and forth. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then up in here, maybe in our world back in here lives some little evergreen trees"
Bob Ross,"and sometimes you can make gorgeous little tree indications, just taking a little fan brush and pushing upward, just push it upward. Well make all kinds of little trees"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add the least little touch of white there so it stands out a little better, so for television it shows up. There. That shows up a little better"
Bob Ross,"But in your world you make them any degree of darkness or lightness that you want. There we go. Wherever, wherever. And did you know, if youve painted with me before, we dont make mistakes"
Bob Ross,We have happy accidents. And all that means is that very soon you learn to work with anything that happens on this piece of canvas. Literally anything that happens
Bob Ross,"Because sometimes things that you think are big mistakes and youre really worried about, when the paintings finished they end up being the highlight of the entire painting. There"
Bob Ross,And each painting will teach you something. Learn from it. As long as you learn from an experience then its not wasted. Its not wasted. Its only wasted when you accept it as failure
Bob Ross,"And we dont have any failure here. We dont have any. Its against the rules. In Bobs world, thats against the rules"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Ill go back to a two inch brush, be sure its clean and dry, and I want to create the illusion of mist down at the base of this"
Bob Ross,"So all we do, firmly, with the top corner of the brush, just tap. Just tap it. Thats really and truly all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Then were gonna lift slightly upward, just enough to take out the little tap marks and sort of blend everything together and make it very soft"
Bob Ross,"Now, it looks like a little row of trees that lives wee wee back here in the distance somewhere. Just happy little trees"
Bob Ross,"Now, Im going to go into crimson, blue, and black same colors but this time Im gonna add much much less of the white color to it. Much less. There, I want it to be quite a bit darker"
Bob Ross,"In a landscape painting, as you know, as things get closer to you they should get darker and darker in value. This is sort of a lavender color"
Bob Ross,"Load both sides of the ol fan brush, and lets put another row of trees"
Bob Ross,"Another thing that you find when youre doing landscapes, the more plains or the more areas that you have in here, the deeper that your painting will look. Thats what gives a painting depth, distance"
Bob Ross,"Thats what will make your painting very, very special. When people look at it theyll say, Oh I can look in there and see forever.  There. And thats what does it. Maybe this comes, yeah, why not"
Bob Ross,Right up in here. Something like that. And were just looking for indications for trees. These are too far away to see a lot of detail. Well put a little detail on them but not much
Bob Ross,"Not much, we get too much detail it will ruin that illusion of distance in your painting. And thats a good friend. We want that"
Bob Ross,"Alright, now if you want to give a few of these trees the indication of a little more detail, just do that"
Bob Ross,"Take the corner of the fan brush and make it look like here and there, and there and here, theres a big strong tree that lives up in here. Maybe he got more sunlight or more water, and he grew big"
Bob Ross,"Just wherever you think they should be. Just drop them in. Like that. Shoot, I think we about have that. Maybe a couple over on this side. But that easy, we can make a pretty nice little background"
Bob Ross,"You know for many years I was a traditional painter, and one of the things, when I was a traditional painter, that was extremely difficult was making reflections, and in this technique its one of the"
Bob Ross,"easiest, nicest, most effective things that happened. Watch here. Come right up in here"
Bob Ross,"All you have to do is touch the canvas with a little titanium white, we have color on the canvas already and pull it straight down. Its important to come straight down though. Straight down"
Bob Ross,"Itll pick up all those gorgeous transparent colors that we had underneath there. That easy. And very gently, we go across. Just like that. See there. And instantly it begins looking like water"
Bob Ross,"Time to wash the ol brush. If youve painted with me before, you know this is really the whole thing, its the most fun part of the entire procedure. Shake it off. And just beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,I thought maybe today wed have a little snow scene. Ill show you a very easy way of making snow. Very easy way. Well just take titanium white we use that same ol two inch brush
Bob Ross,This is one of the simplest ways of making very nice snow. Tap it
Bob Ross,"If youve painted with me before this is the way we make little grassy areas, but I want to make snow that looks powdery, like, well skiers call it powder so sometimes snow looks like that"
Bob Ross,All you do is just tap. Just tap. Something like so. Very gently. There. See. Thats all there is to it. All there is to it. All youre doing is just tapping the canvas
Bob Ross,"And well go back to this very, very soft blender brush. Its very soft. Get a clean one and gently just graze it just enough to bring it together. And itll give that indication of very soft snow"
Bob Ross,"Watch here, watch here, watch here. I get excited. Ive probably painted a million pictures, I think, and I still get excited with this"
Bob Ross,Maybe in our world maybe this tree watch here you can grab trees and pull them into the foreground. This easy
Bob Ross,"Just gonna take that tree bring it right on down and well bring it right here so it pushes that little snowbank back. It goes back behind it now. It works so good in me well have one over here, too"
Bob Ross,"I like that. I like that. And this is your world so you can do anything that you want here. Any ol thing that you want, there it goes. Have one there. Lets give him a friend"
Bob Ross,"I like to make evergreen trees. They work so well and theyre a lot of fun, and theyre gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous"
Bob Ross,"Now we can go back to our ol brush here that has the titanium white on it, load a little bit. And you work in layers. See we did the thing that was in the background first"
Bob Ross,"And now well begin working forward, forward, forward. Always starting with the most distant object and working forward. There we go"
Bob Ross,"On the other side well do the same thing, well bring it right underneath this tree. Just right on out, a little join together there. There. Alright"
Bob Ross,"But isnt that a super easy way of doing a very effective illusion. Just making snow. Back to our little blender brush. Very lightly. Two hairs and some air. Very lightly, just blend that"
Bob Ross,"Now we have that white on the brush, lets go back and reinforce this reflection. I want to make it a little brighter so it jumps out at you. Just like that. And go across. Just like that"
Bob Ross,"Now then, just take a little bit of the liquid white. Liquid white is just an oil based medium. And we use it to thin paint, we use it to cover the canvas, and we use it to make water lines"
Bob Ross,"Just cut across, can you see that. Just cut across with a knife. And we go right up in here and lets just cut in a little water line that lives right there. Right there. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"These water lines should be basically straight though. By that I mean going back and forth across, because if theyre not straight your water look like its gonna run right out of the painting"
Bob Ross,You might have to tie a bucket on the side to catch the overflow. There. Maybe down in here theres a little ripple. Whatever. Whatever. Its up to you. Totally and completely. There we are. Like that
Bob Ross,"Now then, you ready to get crazy. Lets do it. Lets have some big fun. Lets take a phthalo blue and alizarin crimson and no white, its just blue and crimson"
Bob Ross,"Im making a very deep lavender that should look black. Tap the bristles of the brush firmly into the paint. Give it a little push. And time to get crazy, this is your bravery test"
Bob Ross,"Maybe weve got a big tree. You know me, I like big trees. Yep, there it is. There it is. It lives right up here. And Im using, just mainly the corner of the brush oops went right over that tree"
Bob Ross,"Thats alright, we know hes back there. Maybe, maybe, maybe in our world maybe theres a big bush. Youre right, he lives right there"
Bob Ross,Just sort of make these things up in your mind and let them go whever you want them. Maybe theres. maybe theres a whole little group of bushes that live here. I dont know
Bob Ross,A little bunny rabbit has to have a place to hide. And thats a pretty good one right there
Bob Ross,"We can take our liner brush, use a little of the dark sienna, and Im thinning the paint because one of our golden rules is a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Thin will stick to thick"
Bob Ross,"Taken this dark sienna, a little bit of white in it, just enough to dilute it a little"
Bob Ross,And here and there were gonna just put in an indication of a few little tree trunks and sticks and twigs that live back. Not looking for a lot of detail. Not yet
Bob Ross,Were gonna put some detail in the foreground but not yet
Bob Ross,And well probably cover most of those up but a few of thems gonna show through and itll look like you worked yourself to death up there trying to get all those
Bob Ross,"Lets go into a little white and a little touch, a little touch, of phthalo blue with it. Just enough to cool it. Not much. Titanium white, but push it, push it"
Bob Ross,"You can see that little ridge of paint right there. Theres one just like it on your brush and thats what we end up painting with. Push it, about a 45 degree angle"
Bob Ross,"Now very lightly, using just the corner of the brush, just begin tapping in all kinds of little things in there. Okay, maybe we need to load a little more paint on the brush"
Bob Ross,"Now if you have trouble making a stick, add the least little touch of liquid white or paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"The liquid white will make your color a little brighter, the paint thinner will leave it the same color. They both work very well, make up your mind what you want to do"
Bob Ross,"If you want it to be a little brighter then add the liquid white. If you want it to stay the same color paint thinner. But very little, no matter what. Very little"
Bob Ross,The secret to this painting technique is to keep your oil paints as firm and dry as possible. That way you can continually paint over the top of it without them mixing together
Bob Ross,"You dont want to become a mud mixer. And if youve painted, weve all mixed a little mud. There we go. See. Now think about, think about little individual bushes and stuff that live in here"
Bob Ross,Im gonna dip the brush into a little touch of the liquid white myself. Just to thin that down so it sticks easier. There we go. Think about shape and form. Dont just throw these in at random
Bob Ross,"One at a time. Do the one that you think is farthest away and work forward, forward, forward. Always working forward. There we go. One at a time. One at a time"
Bob Ross,"I know you get tired of hearing that, but it works for you. And I want this, I want you to enjoy success with this. Cuz if you enjoy success youll get hooked on it"
Bob Ross,I enjoyed some success with this many years ago. And it has become my entire life and I love it. Lets go into vandyke brown and some dark sienna. Well just mix them together
Bob Ross,"Vandyke brown, dark sienna bravery test time. Maybe in our world there lives you ready for this. There lives right here, in one stroke, lets put a nice tree trunk. Alright lets give him a friend"
Bob Ross,"Yeah I know, I think everybody should have a friend, even a tree. Even an ol tree. A little titanium white, this is a birch tree, Ive decided. Touch, give it a little round-ward pull"
Bob Ross,"Let me exaggerate. whistle That way. Gotta make that little noise, too. See there. Just make it look, no pressure. Let the knife just barely, barely touch so the paint breaks"
Bob Ross,"And by breaking I mean it leaves all those little open holes in it. There. On the other side, a little bit in the other direction. Like so. There. Wherever you think they should be"
Bob Ross,"Something like so, we can go back to the dark sienna and vandyke brown mixture, add a little bit right in the middle, and when this dries and it dries, it will feel like real birch bark"
Bob Ross,"Itll project off the canvas. The paints think, theres a lot of it. It really, really jumps right off there. Lets go back to our little liner brush"
Bob Ross,"Get a little of that vandyke brown, paint thinner. The thinners there only to thin the paint, make it very thin. Very thin"
Bob Ross,"And here and there lets just put an indication of a few little limbs and little things that live out here. This little tree needs some arms on him. Shoot, hes got to reach out and talk to this guy"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Just a few. Just a few. That works so well, I think its time to really get crazy. Let me put a little bush down here. I want to cover up his foots"
Bob Ross,"Down here at the base of this, just wanna cover his foots up. Right now theyre sort of just hanging there. But well make them come right out of that little bush. Right there, right there"
Bob Ross,"Im going back into my brown. Big bravery test. Right there. Right there. Maybe this is a different kind of tree here, just to break it up a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some white, a little dark sienna, mix it together. Put a little vandyke in there, too, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"Take a little bit of paint and all were gonna do is just begin touching, just touch, something like so. There we are. Just touch it. Touch it. Thats all. Touch"
Bob Ross,And as you work around were gonna let it get darker and darker and darker and darker. As it goes around the tree
Bob Ross,"Put a little brown with your color, a little of that vandyke brown, see it gets darker automatically. Once again when this is dry it will actually feel like bark on a tree. Alright, wipe the knife off"
Bob Ross,Back to the paint thinner. Little bit of vandyke brown with paint thinner. Just to thin it. And lets put an arm on this tree. Maybe it lives in our world right out in here
Bob Ross,"Boy, this would be a gorgeous place for a tree to live. Gorgeous place for a tree to live. Maybe theres another arm right here. Its up to you. You decide how many arms are on your tree. Or how few"
Bob Ross,"Maybe your tree died last year, or sometime, and its just about just about over. Make up little stories when youre painting, little stories just in your mind"
Bob Ross,"And you know, painters are expected to be a little strange so, thats alright if you stand around and talk to yourself about this scene and the ol guy that lived out here or whatever, thats alright"
Bob Ross,if people look at you a little strange. Painters are supposed to be that way. Maybe out in here theres just a little ol stick that lives. Use a little of the light color here
Bob Ross,"Wherever you think that should be. Its up to you. Up to you. Ill tell you what, maybe theres an ol limb. Right there. Something like that. Hes a tired old limb"
Bob Ross,"Now you can take the knife get that brush clean, and you can scrape through this and allow the black canvas to show through. And itll look like little sticks and twigs that live back in here"
Bob Ross,"I hope you can see those. When you do your own painting youll see them, theyll be there. Something about like so. Alright, thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,I think were about ready to take the contact paper off here and see what we have. This is the moment of truth. So we just grab the paper pull it right off
Bob Ross,"And all of a sudden you have a painting thats right there in that oval. And it comes out so gorgeous, and it just, these paintings excite people"
Bob Ross,"I know none of us are interested in those happy bucks but if youre out selling paintings, these are different. Youll be surprised at how people will come along and theyll marvel at how you did this"
Bob Ross,"Its very very nice. I think its time to sign this ol painting. And with that, well take a little bit of the bright red. Signatures are as unique as painters"
Bob Ross,"Each person will develop their own signature. So find your own signature. Ive had people that sign with initials, with their whole name, Ive even known people whove signed with a little symbol"
Bob Ross,"Its up to you. But pick a signature and stick with it, because it becomes your trademark. And people a hundred years from now will look at your painting and recognize exactly that it was you"
Bob Ross,"Alright, lets go right in here and just sign this one. I have a very short name, so its quite easy. Well sign it, call it done. There. And I hope you enjoyed this one"
Bob Ross,"Its a very easy painting, Id love to see some photos of your work. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. instrumental music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, its a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever youre at"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets start out today and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this little painting along with us"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got done today. Have my standard old 18 x 24 inch canvas, but you can use any size thats convenient for you"
Bob Ross,"Now, today Ive taken and covered the top part of the canvas with liquid white"
Bob Ross,"Now, liquid whites just and oil-based medium that makes the canvas wet and slick and allows us to actually blend color right on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"The bottom now, I started with liquid black, which is the same identical medium, only its black"
Bob Ross,"And I started making little xs and I worked up til they blended together, so we have a graduation from white to black"
Bob Ross,"And with that, lets just make a happy little scene today, one thats fun and I think youll enjoy. Lets start out with a little tiny two inch brush. There we go. Take a little bit of the thalo blue"
Bob Ross,"Now, thalo blue is a gorgeous, gorgeous blue. Beautiful color, dont need much though, its very strong. Tap the bristles, that distributes the paint all the way through the bristles very evenly"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go up in here. Now, Im gonna start up here in this corner, just making little xs, little criss cross strokes. And we just dance in a quick little happy sky"
Bob Ross,"There, very easy little sky, something nice and simple, well just drop it in like that. There, thats all there is to it, little something like that"
Bob Ross,"Now then, go back in the same color, only this time Im gonna tap the bristles firmly right into the paint, but very little paint, just tap it. See. Just tap"
Bob Ross,"Now we take that top corner of the brush and I wanna make the indication of a big old, strong cloud. Were using exactly the same color"
Bob Ross,"But just by doing something this simple, you can create that illusion without a lot of work. There we go. And Im lazy, I look for easy ways to make gorgeous paintings that work"
Bob Ross,"I have people in their 90s that write me letters and say, My fourth grade art teacher told me I have no talent and Ive spent my whole life wanting to paint and I tried your technique and it works,"
Bob Ross,"it works.  Now, those are the kind of letters that I love to see. There. Alright we just blend it a little bit"
Bob Ross,"I wanna put a little indication here and there, maybe of a little sunlight that just zinging through these clouds, so I just tap in a little area, get our little blender brush, and very lightly you"
Bob Ross,"can blend that and it might not look like a whole lot now, but when your paintings finished itll look like little light areas where the sunlights playing through there"
Bob Ross,"There, its also a nice way of making clouds. Today I just wanna put little indications of little happy floaters that are going all over the sky. Back to our little blender"
Bob Ross,"And this blender brush is so soft, you can blend right over that firm paint without disturbing it. Alright. Thats all there is to it. With that we got a pretty nice little sky"
Bob Ross,"Lets take black, midnght black, alizerin crimson, a little thalo blue, well put a little Van Dyke brown there too, what the heck. Its your world, you make it any old color you want it"
Bob Ross,"What were looking predominantly for, black color, dark. Cut off a little roll of paint and it lives right there, you can see it, lives right on the edge of the knife. Lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now lets have a big mountain that lives up here in our world, right there. Just take the knife and firmly push this paint right into the fabric of the canvas, push it"
Bob Ross,"Push it, really get in there and this is where you take out all your frustrations and hostilities. Get in there and just, as my son Steve says, mush it in. There we go"
Bob Ross,"I dont know if thats a word or not, but everybody knows what he means when he says that. Now well take a two inch brush and we wanna grab this, this has the liquid white and black on it"
Bob Ross,"So color will move, you can literally slide it around on the canvas. If this was a dry canvas, right now youd be in agony city trying to pull that paint"
Bob Ross,"But its wet and we can move it anywhere we want it. The only thing were concerned with is that nice top edge up here, rest of it, we dont care. We really dont care at this point"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets go into, lets just go into titanium white, Im gonna put the least little bit of black into it just to grey it down a little bit. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,Maybe even a little tiny bit of the bright red. Pull it out as flat as you can get it. Cut across and get that little roll of paint again. It lives right out at the edge of the knife
Bob Ross,"And maybe, tell you what, lets have the light coming from the left today, what the heck. Or maybe in your world, you want it coming from the other direction. It dont matter"
Bob Ross,"It doesnt matter, however you want it. Totally and completely up to you"
Bob Ross,"And just sort of wiggling the knife back and forth here, I wanna make a nice, ridge that comes right on down like that and let it blend outward. No pressure, absolutely no pressure"
Bob Ross,"There, just think about where light would zing through here. And sometimes I use the little knife cause you can get in there and put more detail in it"
Bob Ross,"But right here we have a very limited amount of time. Shoot, Ive got a mean old director, if I dont finish in 30 minutes, she has no sense of humor. Absolutely none. There we go"
Bob Ross,"So well use the big knife, but when youre painting at home, find the tools and equipment that are most comfortable to you and thats the ones you wanna use. Thats the ones"
Bob Ross,"Alright, we take a little white, put a little thalo blue in it. Well make a shadow color, Im gonna add a little black, too, just to dull it down. Just to dull it down a little bit"
Bob Ross,"There, nice shadow color, same way, cut off a little roll of paint and we go right up in here and begin thinking where shadows would live"
Bob Ross,"Lights coming from the left, wheres all these gorgeous little shadows gonna live in your mountain"
Bob Ross,"There, now one thing youll find, if youre right-handed, normally its easier to have the light coming from the right. Normally. And I say normally because were all different"
Bob Ross,"But now if youre left handed, its a whole different story because I find, as Anette and I travel all over and teach, we find that left-handed people have been forced all their life to do"
Bob Ross,"right-handed things and for that reason, sometimes left-handed people prefer to highlight on the left or the right. Its very individual. Very individual"
Bob Ross,"My brother Jim was left-handed and I grew up with him, so Im used to working with left-handed people"
Bob Ross,"There, chuckling when we were kids, we used to fight like cats and dogs, you know how brothers are. And I never expected that left hand to get me. Boy, he used to sock me"
Bob Ross,"Now he grew up and, hes bigger, I hope he doesnt remember all that. There we go. Hes a good man, though. Hes my best friend in the whole world. There"
Bob Ross,"Something about like that, and you just let this go wherever you want it. Maybe it comes right on down, just let your imagination take you to anywhere that you wanna be"
Bob Ross,"Anywhere, just sorta let those blend together, the highlights and the shadows. Gently, gently, gently work em together. And we can use a little blender brush here. Just tap it gently and very lightly"
Bob Ross,"This blender brush is so great for softening. There, dont know why I waited so long to introduce it, we just introduced this, I think, in the last series, its relatively a new brush"
Bob Ross,"Just wonderful, just some of the most fantastic effects. There, alright, were in business. Tell you what, lets have some fun. Go back, lets use the old two inch brush today, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"Im tapping the brush firmly right into the paint, cause Im gonna paint, I think Ill paint today, show you how to use just the top corner of an old two inch brush and do some things that are"
Bob Ross,"unbelievable, come right up here. Now, take the top corner and begin tapping in some basic little tree shapes. Were not looking for detail yet"
Bob Ross,"All were looking for is basic, basic tree shapes and forms, thats all were looking for. They live right here in front of this gorgeous mountain, what a view"
Bob Ross,"What a view, I lived in Alaska a dozen years or more and I think, as Ive said in some other shows, God was having a good day when he made Alaska"
Bob Ross,"There are some days, its like when you paint, some days you cant do anything wrong, everything works for you"
Bob Ross,"And I think God was having one of those days when he made Alaska, some of the most gorgeous scenery Ive ever seen. There we go. See"
Bob Ross,"Just using the top corner of this little two inch brush to tap in all these little basic shapes. Theres not right, theres no wrong"
Bob Ross,"There, all you do is drop em in and even here, you begin making out, see theres all kind of little things happening, dont cover them up, leave em in there, they become your friend"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, I like these old big trees. Lets have another one over here. Something about like that. There. There we go, see"
Bob Ross,"Just, once again, basic, very basic shape, think like a tree, just think like a tree. Hows the trees arms, how do they hang off the sides"
Bob Ross,"Look at trees, make friends with trees, study em, study em, go out in your yard and talk to a tree, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"Your neighbors might look at you like youre a little strange, but tell em youre an artist, theyll understand that"
Bob Ross,"Now, while we have this little brush going here, down here in the bottom in this black, I want a little bluish color"
Bob Ross,"Little bluish color, Im gonna take a little of the Prussian blue, just a little Prussian blue, and just add a little blue right in here, not much. Not much"
Bob Ross,"And maybe in our world back in here, well take a little paint thinner, remember our golden rule, thin paint will stick to a thick paint, so Im gonna take a little dark sienna, least little touch of"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go up in here and maybe, yep, youre right, here and there the indication, just the indication of a little tree trunk stem, whatever you wanna call it, that lives right here, limbs and"
Bob Ross,"branches, whatever. But they live in these trees. They live in there"
Bob Ross,"Now most of this were gonna end up covering up with leaves, but some of itll show through and itll be gorgeous and people, when they look at your painting, shoot, theyll think you spent half your"
Bob Ross,"life doing this painting, shh, dont tell em no different. Alright, well go, lets just keep using the same old two inch brush, I left the dirty color on it, went right into yellow"
Bob Ross,"Now, go slightly above the dark and take this color and very gently, just using the top corner of the brush, thats all, little yellow, ochre and Indian yellow here and there, just the top corner"
Bob Ross,"begin tapping in all these little basic shapes. If you have trouble making the paint stick, add the least little touch of paint thinner. Just a little paint thinner. There. See there"
Bob Ross,Did you ever think you could paint all this detail just using the corner of a two inch brush. It looks like something youve painted the barn with last week
Bob Ross,"You can do that, you can do anything that you believe you can do. And I know you can do this, so certainly if I know it, you know it, too"
Bob Ross,"Going to a little yellow ochre, and I want to touch a bright red once in awhile, just to change the flavor. Ooh, I like that one, I like that one. Thats a nice one. Very nice color"
Bob Ross,"Thatd warm up any room right there. There, and begin working on little individual trees and bushes and things that live all in here"
Bob Ross,"Just think about all these little guys, give em names if necessary. Give em names, this is Clyde, he lives right here. Like that, like that, see. Darker, darker, darker"
Bob Ross,"Just let em get way back in there, like that. As Ive mentioned frequently, when youre painting, I find it helps a great deal to make up little stories about your painting"
Bob Ross,"Think about, think about this area, would you like to live there. Maybe somebody does live there. There we go, make up little stories about it"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little animal that lives here thats your friend and you know him very well. Talk about him, there. Something like that"
Bob Ross,"Now, got another old big tree over here, it needs a little bit, there. Well just put a little in there, Im gonna dip a least little touch of paint thinner, just to make it a little thinner"
Bob Ross,"There, see. Goes on so much easier. And you have to do that every once in awhile. Especially if the paints the same consistency"
Bob Ross,"There, okay, darker, darker, darker as it works down, darker and darker. That helps create the illusion of shadows and stuff down in here. Maybe in here is some dark little bushes"
Bob Ross,"They just live in here, wherever you want em. There they are. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes you can take this brush, get a little red on it, and you can just sorta take the corner of it and move it back and forth, see. Just the corner, what a good shot, there. See"
Bob Ross,"Just take it back and forth. And now, when you go up here and touch it, itll make little pointy things. See. They got little points on em and it sorta, it sorta changes the flavor"
Bob Ross,"Gives you a bush thats a little different right in there. Okay, take a little bit of the reddish col-- ooh, I like that one, little firecracker right there. Little old firecracker"
Bob Ross,"There we go, and just very back and forth between the greens and the yellows and all these little colors"
Bob Ross,"But each one of these layers creates a different plane in your painting and thats what creates that illusion of depth and distance. There we go. Shoot, lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Lets have some fun, we can clean off a spot to work here. Lets take black, little bit of the Prussian blue, some brown, thalo green, I like thalo green, well make some evergreens"
Bob Ross,"There, a little crimson in there too, what the heck. Its our world, we can do anything we want. We wipe our knife off. i just wipe the knife on an old paper towel"
Bob Ross,"Go back into our color with a fan brush. Load a lot of paint in the brush, lotta paint, lotta paint. Maybe in our world there lives an evergreen tree right there"
Bob Ross,"If thats the case, add the least little touch of paint thinner, just dip the corner of your brush into a little paint thinner, then go back through your paint and itll the soften the paint, make it"
Bob Ross,"thinner, so it slides right on there. Enough of them little ones, we need a big old tree. And he lives right in there somewhere"
Bob Ross,"There, see you can go on over this, sometimes you need to add a little thinner cause a thin paint will stick to a thick paint"
Bob Ross,And that way itll go right over the top of it without any problem and without all coming together. Well put one more in there and then well quit over this way
Bob Ross,"Now, I know nature doesnt know that rule and youre gonna tell me you looked out the other day and saw and even number of trees in your yard, I know thats true, but artistically, it does look a"
Bob Ross,"little better. But if you wanna have an even number of trees in your world, thats your business and its your tree and your world and you do it any way that you want"
Bob Ross,"Alright, now lets take a little white, little bit of Van Dyke and dark sienna mixed in there"
Bob Ross,"And lets just put us a indication here and there little bit of tree trunk, it lives there, I dont want a lot over here Just a little, just indications, maybe even back in there is a little"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you think they should live. We can take that same old brush, go back through cause it has the tree color on him. Go back over some cad yellow and yellow ochre, little Indian yeller, yellow"
Bob Ross,"Lotta color, lets go back up in here. Our lights coming in from the left so we wanna emphasize the left side of the tree a little more than the right"
Bob Ross,"There we go, and just begin dropping in a few highlights, dont overdo, youll lose all this gorgeous darkness and evergreens are normally, normally, I say, a little bit darker than other trees"
Bob Ross,"There they go. Something about like that, darker, darker, darker. Now, lets go into Van Dyke brown. Time to get crazy here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world there lives some dirt, big rocks, stones, all kinda things, right here. That easy. That easy. There. Alright, maybe comes right on out in here"
Bob Ross,"We talk a little of that, that was that brown and white we had left over from the tree trunks. We just pull something out like that, like that"
Bob Ross,"Now, well take a lighter brown and white maybe that one was in shadow, just sorta make up little things, and here, this one here, is a little bit stronger, little bit more light hittin that"
Bob Ross,"Just let the knife barely touch, bounce along there, barely touching, barely, barely touching"
Bob Ross,"Alright, take and just grab it here and there and sort of pull it down and make it look like a big, strong bank right there. That easy"
Bob Ross,"Our fan brush that has the greens on it and stuff, we just take it and pop in, pushing upward, pop in the indication, little bushes and things that live right out in here"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets have some fun, Im gonna take a little bit of black, put some paint thinner with it, and make it very thin, I want a thin paint"
Bob Ross,"Little bit of black, put some brown in there, too, black and brown. Okay, but its very thin, its got a lot of paint thinner in it"
Bob Ross,"Now, I wanna take some brown and some white, little black in it, and well make a lighter color thats also very thin. Thats all there is to it, just put a little paint thinner with it"
Bob Ross,"Well take our little filbert brush. Well go right through the dark, load both sides full of dark, and Im gonna go right down here, pull only one side through the light"
Bob Ross,"And with that, in one stroke, you can make all kinds of little indications of little rocks and stones that live back in here like that"
Bob Ross,"Now, little bit, and I say that again, a little bit of titanium white on the two inch brush, I wanna keep this quite dark, just touch and pull downward, pull downward a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Just enough, just enough to show. I want this water to be very dark, mysterious water so that liquid black comes in so great. It makes wonderful, wonderful effects like that"
Bob Ross,"Little while, little thalo blue and then well just take, and just touch the canvas. This is thick paint, normally I use a thin, thin paint to do water lines"
Bob Ross,"This ones much thicker, all Im doing is just touching, just touch the canvas"
Bob Ross,"The canvas will take off what it wants, give you back whats left, just like a tax man does, chuckles just like he does with my paycheck"
Bob Ross,"Yeah, he just takes off what he wants and whats left, it isnt much. Alright, back into our dark color"
Bob Ross,"That was mostly, we had some Prussian blue, I think black, brown, little sap green, crimson, doesnt matter. Lets put a little projections that comes out of this side"
Bob Ross,"And all Im doing is putting some dark color on so our light will show. Something about like that. We dont know where it goes, dont know that we care"
Bob Ross,"I got another two inch brush here that I was using that has green on it and with that, yeah, look, look, look, well put in, just tapping, follow the angles though, follow angles, most important"
Bob Ross,"A little more of the yellow ochre in that one, just enough to change the flavor a little bit. There, see. Put all these little things in here wherever you want em. Wherever you want em"
Bob Ross,Something about like that. There we go. And you can change angles and stuff and all kinds of things will happen. Back to our blue and white on a knife
Bob Ross,"And lets put a little water line right around there. That sorta just brings it all together, keep it dark, though, very, very dark"
Bob Ross,"Our filbert brush, I wanna put a rock over there, I like these little rocks, theyre the most fun to make. Bloop, bloop, bloop, one stroke and theyre in. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, I think with that, were about ready for a signature on this one, take a little red, little paint thinner. Well call this little painting finished"
Bob Ross,"Hope youve enjoyed it, its a nice way to use the liquid black, give you a lot of experience. I think with that, were gonna call this one done"
Bob Ross,"And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. smooth jazz music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, Im certainly glad to see you today, because I thought today wed do a painting thats just a lot of fun"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this little painting with us. And while theyre doing that, let me show you this craziness Ive got up here today"
Bob Ross,"Today, I took my standard old pre-stretched double-primed 18 by 24 inch canvas, but once again, you can use any size thats convenient for you"
Bob Ross,"I just like this size because it fits a television screen good. I took a paper towel and acrylic paint, now were using oils, but I used acrylic paint to put a dry undercoat on here"
Bob Ross,"Now, I just took a paper towel, and a little bit of sienna and umber, and just dabbed it, just everywhere. Then here, I found an old filbert brush and just pulled a couple things through"
Bob Ross,And I allowed all that to dry. Now Ive covered the entire canvas with liquid clear. The liquid clear just makes it wet and slick. Thats really all its there for
Bob Ross,"The bottom of the canvas, then Ive covered with a mixture of Sap Green and Alizarin Crimson. That makes a gorgeous brown color"
Bob Ross,And I thought Id wait until you got here to do the top part so you can see exactly how its done
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes when Im walking through the woods, which I do frequently, sometimes the suns coming through the trees and you see this beautiful glow coming right through the trees"
Bob Ross,"And some of the trees that are close to that glow, they sort of just disappear into it. And thats the effect I was trying to achieve. And Im gonna show you a very easy way to make that. All right"
Bob Ross,"Lets go today, we use a two inch brush to get started here. Im going to go right into a little bit of the Indian Yellow. I like Indian Yellow because its very transparent"
Bob Ross,"Very transparent, its a gorgeous color. Lets go right up in here. Now with that, right over this acrylic, with the liquid clear on it. Im just going to cover the entire canvas here"
Bob Ross,The entire top part of it. The bottom is covered with that brownish color. There. Just like so. About like that. Its really all we have to do right now. But see how easy that goes on
Bob Ross,"If you dont have the clear on there, the liquid clear, this is quite a job putting it on. Ive got now since we have the clear, I use this any time that Im using a black canvas"
Bob Ross,"Or a canvas that has some color or design on it. It makes it so much easier. Ill go right into, I made a little of that brown color"
Bob Ross,"Once again, its Alizarin Crimson and Sap Green in about equal parts. I just went ahead and mixed up a little pile here because Im going to use a lot of it I think"
Bob Ross,"And right up here in the corner, Ill add a little bit more. I just want to darken this corner. Make it look like a suns shining through here. About like that, and thats really all we need"
Bob Ross,"Its all we need. There. Okay, let me wash the brush. If youve painted with us before, you know this is the most fun part of this whole technique. We wash it with odorless paint thinner, shake it off"
Bob Ross,brush thuds laughs And just beat the devil out of it. Good way to take out all your hostilities and frustrations
Bob Ross,I want to take a little bit of the Cadmium Yellow and put it right over here with some Titanium White. Dont need a lot of white. Lets go up in here
Bob Ross,Now figure out where the sun lives in your painting. I think its right there. Take the corner of the brush and well start there. And well begin working outward. I want this to be very bright
Bob Ross,Itd go right over these trees. I want to just absolutely blend them out where the lights going to be zinging through there. Just blend them out. Little more of the white. There. Right in there
Bob Ross,Want that to be very bright. If thats our hot spot. Thats the source of our light in this painting. And you can do this as many times as you desire to achieve a desired lightness
Bob Ross,"But I suggest each time you do, get a clean brush or clean your brush. Just depending on how many brushes you have. There. Well just let this little glow just work its way out"
Bob Ross,Already you can see how those trees are almost disappearing in that strong direct sunlight. And thats exactly the effect that I was trying to achieve. And this makes it so simple. So simple. There
Bob Ross,"And then well just blend the entire thing out. Now already, that looks like a sunlight coming through there so strong it almost hurts your eyes. Fantastic. That easy. All right. Ill tell you what"
Bob Ross,Lets use the old filbert brush today. I like the filbert brush. Im just going to go into a little bit of the Titanium White with the filbert brush. Just load both sides up
Bob Ross,"Both sides up, something like so. A lot of color. Fully loaded on both sides. Now maybe in our world back here, lets make this a winter scene. It can be winter or summer"
Bob Ross,I think well do winter today. Maybe back in here we touch and theres just a little indication of some snow that lives back here. Barely touch the canvas. I want to just graze it. Just graze it
Bob Ross,I want it just to begin picking up some of that color we have underneath. Just graze it though. It has that brown underneath so its going to pick up a little bit of that
Bob Ross,All were doing is just grazing. Sometimes you can put a lot of paint on there and just let it bounce along and break and by break I mean it has all these little holes in there. Barely touching
Bob Ross,"Just, let it just drag across the canvas. Allow the canvas to do the work. Let it pull off the paint that it wants. Then whats left on the brush you can just sort of scrub it in"
Bob Ross,"And work back and forth. Where you want to highlight, put it on very thick. There. About like that. Now"
Bob Ross,"As Ive mentioned earlier, Ive already mixed up a large pile here of the Alizarin Crimson and Sap Green to make a beautiful brown color"
Bob Ross,"Now you can, you can take that to the reddish side by adding more crimson or to the greenish side depending on your mood. I usually go a little more to the reddish side. I sort of like that"
Bob Ross,A lot of color on the brush. Shoot. We might as well check you out for bravery right off in this painting. Maybe. You ready. Maybe whistles right there. Just pull it down
Bob Ross,"A lot of paint on the brush. Very thick, very thick. Lets have a, lets have a whole grove of trees. Maybe its wintertime. These trees have lost their leaves. Lost their leaves"
Bob Ross,"The snows just beginning to collect on the ground. All the little squirrels and stuff. Theyre probably up here hibernating, taking life easy for the winter. There. All right"
Bob Ross,"If you watch the show in the past, you know I like little squirrels. I have a bunch of squirrels. I raise, well I usually raise anywhere from two or three to a half a dozen a year. Turn them loose"
Bob Ross,I have the good fortune of working with a lot of the rehab people around the country
Bob Ross,Here in Muncie theres a lovely lady named Diana Schaffer that takes care of animals and shes taught me a tremendous amount about all these little creatures
Bob Ross,And in Florida theres several other people that I work with
Bob Ross,"I like to work with animals, and these people, they work with injured and orphaned animals and devote their whole life to it and I have a great respect for them. There"
Bob Ross,I want these trees instead of the nice smooth ones we usually make. Lets make some trees today that have character. These trees are not going to end up as future telephone poles. Guarantee you
Bob Ross,"I want them to be ragged. grunts Rough, rough. Thats what my dog said when he sat down on the sandpaper. Rough. Bad joke"
Bob Ross,Now Im pushing because I want a lot of little things to happen with the brush. Normally you would pull so youd get a smoother line. I want the roughness today
Bob Ross,"I want these trees to look like, oh, its been a rough life out here. See. Pulling the edges out. Really rough. This is a place you wouldnt want to go in the middle of a dark night"
Bob Ross,"Its one of them scary places. There. When I was young, there was some places where I lived that, they were just sort of scary"
Bob Ross,"Youd be out the evening and it started getting dusk, you could make out all kind of monsters that lived in there. There we are. But we lived way out in the woods. I grew up in Florida"
Bob Ross,And we lived so far back in the woods they used to have to pipe sunlight into us. There. All right. See how all them all limbs. Well come back with a liner brush and put in a few little ones
Bob Ross,"But I really want these old raggedy looking things. Shoot, I like that. I want a tree over here. This is our world, so we can put trees anywhere we want them. Maybe it comes all the way down to there"
Bob Ross,I dont know. You make that decision. And this paintings great if youve never painted before. This is an easy one. You can do this one. You can do this one
Bob Ross,We try to do some paintings in each series that work so well those who are just beginning can have outstanding results with them
Bob Ross,"Or people whove painted a little bit, they can just have fun with them"
Bob Ross,And we try to do some paintings that have a little more challenge to them for those that have painted for a while and they need a little more challenge
Bob Ross,Im just taking the brush and rubbing it up and down. I want to make the indication of some little bushes that live way back here. Gotta have a place for my little friends to hide. There
Bob Ross,"Probably, a little racoon lives right in there. There we go. I like little racoons when theyre little. They are the cutest little devils"
Bob Ross,"I got a letter from somebody here a while back, they werent happy that I was condoning keeping these animals as pets. Let me emphasize, strongly. I do not keep these animals as pets"
Bob Ross,"I only try to help the rehab people raise them up, and then theyre turned loose back to the wild, because thats where God intended for em to be"
Bob Ross,"I have all these little squirrels in my backyard that Ive raised, and its funny, people come to the house, laughs and theyre like little puppies"
Bob Ross,"Im not exaggerating, they literally, they come to my back door, in fact, theyve ate a hole through my screen on the patio"
Bob Ross,"But they come through the screen, and they come to the back door, and they scratch on the door like a little puppy, wanting me to come out and bring em some goodies. They know Im a soft touch"
Bob Ross,"blows air I just decided I was talking so much, Im gonna put another tree in. But isnt this an easy way to make some gorgeous, old rough looking trees. Tough old trees. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Just get a general idea of where we want em to be. I like that. Now, Ive got a couple of filberts going here, so I dont have to spend all my time just cleaning them"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back in our world, here, just make a decision. whistles Maybe theres some more snow lives right in there. I dont know. You know, painting is such an individual thing"
Bob Ross,"Dont just try to copy somebody elses work. Just do your own thing. We each see nature through totally different eyes, and thats what youre to paint"
Bob Ross,"I say that over and over, because I just dont, I dont want to teach people to copy. Shoot, anybody can copy. Creative freedom, though, is where its at. Thats really The Joy of Painting. There"
Bob Ross,"We use no patterns, no sketches, we let our imagination take us to worlds that we can only imagine. We can do that. We can do that, we can do anything. Anything, at least on this canvas we can"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres another little bush lives right here. Ive mentioned before, on this canvas, I have absolute and total power"
Bob Ross,"I can do anything here my heart desires, I can change the course of mighty rivers, anything. When I go home, the only thing I have any power over is the garbage. It sits there and waits on me"
Bob Ross,"There we are, but thats okay. I can always escape to this piece of canvas and create any illusion that I want. So can you. Maybe theres a big old root on this tree, it comes right out like that"
Bob Ross,"Like that. Lets put some arms on this old tree. grunts Once again, Im pushing a lot with the brush, just to make them all gnarly. Is that a word"
Bob Ross,"My son Steve and I are both bad about making up words. I learnt that from him, he didnt learn it from me, of course. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Old Steve, if youve never had a chance to watch him paint, that son of a gun is one dynamite painter. Hes almost, what, 27 years old now. Hey, and this is the 27th series, what a coincidence"
Bob Ross,"But he has been painting, I think, since he was born. He was about 12 years old before he realized everybody didnt paint. There we go, just a little snow over there"
Bob Ross,Well just bring that little bush in the background down. Were gonna put some sticks and stuff in these little bushes and theyll show up a little better. I hope you can see em. Alright
Bob Ross,"Lets go back to this big old tree. On this side, this is really an exercise in making trees. There it comes, there it comes, there it goes. Think about these old limbs that hang out here and there"
Bob Ross,Now you could just as easy have done this painting in summer or spring. And put leaves on all these trees
Bob Ross,"I just decided today, I wanted to do a scene that, as I mentioned when we started, I like to walk in the woods"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes when I walk in the woods in the winter, the sun comes through so strong, and you have this gorgeous effect"
Bob Ross,"I sit down, and I watch this for a long time, and I kept thinking about how would I make that. And how could I do it easy"
Bob Ross,"I knew how to do it as a traditional painter, its a very time consuming, you have to let things dry between layers, and put some washes and glazes on there"
Bob Ross,"But I wanted the way where somebody could do this very quickly, and easily, without all the agony. And this is what Ive come up with, I think it works. Now this is acrylic paint, as I say"
Bob Ross,"It dries very rapidly, its not very good for doing wet on wet, cause you depend on the canvas staying wet through the entire painting. Doesnt work very well for that"
Bob Ross,"But for this, where you need a dry, undercolor, it works great. I will tell you, there is some controversy in the art world at this time, as to whether putting acrylic under oil is a permanent medium"
Bob Ross,I dont know. I really dont know at this point
Bob Ross,"I have been talking with some manufacturer of art products though, and, about the possibilities of making some other products that there will be no controversy about"
Bob Ross,"So maybe one day, theyll have something like that. Hopefully not too far in the future, cause I like to design new products. That makes painting easy, and makes it work for people. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Im fascinated with machinery and et cetera, for a long time, in college, I was an engineering student. Wanted to be a mechanical engineer. Instead of building bridges, Id rather paint em"
Bob Ross,"A lot of that rubbed off, I think. Im gonna take a little bit of that white, put a little touch of the brown into it. Maybe a little black, just to grey, oh, I like that, just to grey it a little"
Bob Ross,"I want to grey it. Lot of color on the brush, dont be afraid of color, a lot of color. I like sorta hold this thing like I would a pencil. So that its very loose, now then. Touch, and let this dance"
Bob Ross,"Let it play, let it pick up that color, let it leave its own color, let all these things happen, dont fight it. No pressure. Absolutely no pressure. Theres your light, its gonna come across there"
Bob Ross,"No pressure, no pressure. Here it comes, here it comes. Just highlight it, with no pressure. Let me get a little more black on the brush to grey it. There we go"
Bob Ross,"But you need a lot of color on the brush so when you touch it, itll just pull right off. There. See that. Isnt that fantastic"
Bob Ross,"Just with an old filbert brush, you can just about do this entire painting, with just an old filbert brush. Up to you. There we are. Ill have this one come right on through"
Bob Ross,"But Im turning the brush to get all the paint, and it creates different effects as its turning, and wiggling and jiggling. There"
Bob Ross,"Darker and darker as it comes around, cause you want this side next to the light to be the lightest of course. You do that. There. Look at that"
Bob Ross,"All we need up here is a big old hoot owl, itd look like Halloween. There. Alright. One of the other shows, I showed some footage that I had taken with a great big owl"
Bob Ross,"In fact it was a great horned owl. That rascal bit me on the nose, there. Alright, lets do this to a couple other trees here"
Bob Ross,"As I say, this whole painting is mainly just an exercise in painting trees, but when you get it done, people will think you labored over this painting for long periods of time"
Bob Ross,"Shh, dont tell them any different. Dont tell them any different. There. Just let it go, fall right along the edge. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now if you have a lot of time, which we dont here, but if you have a lot of time, you could take a very thin paint, thin it with paint thinner and put it on the script liner brush"
Bob Ross,"A little black in there. And using it sidewards, just pull it down and let it just graze the high points here of that brown. Itll make some gorgeous effects"
Bob Ross,"It does take a little longer than doing this. Try it, you may like it better than this. If you do, then use it. We want to show you as many different ways as possible of creating effects"
Bob Ross,"What you create then, is totally and completely up to you. There, put a little bit over here on this old monster. See, but very loose. Very, very loose. There we are. Something about like so. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Let me wipe off the old brush. Little more of the white paint, and we can just sort of fill this in. Want this to be very rough looking. This paints thick"
Bob Ross,"In fact, in ways, it looks like a traditional painting when its done, you can go back with glazes"
Bob Ross,"Glazes just made from, oh, you can make glazes from something like a little paint thinner, a little linseed oil, a little color"
Bob Ross,"Can make all kinds of beautiful glazes, add a little transparent color to it. You guessed it, laughs I need a big tree. Lives right there"
Bob Ross,"This tree, Im gonna sort put it at an angle, so it looks like its, maybe its bent over a little bit. There we go. Big old legs sticking right out there. Big tree. Big, big tree"
Bob Ross,"Yeah, there he comes. Alright. There. See, it doesnt matter if you pick up some of that color, it makes it look good. Big old limbs hanging out on him. Right across that one, we dont care"
Bob Ross,"See, dont be afraid of it. Do it, enjoy it. Its what makes it fun. Back to our brush that has the light color on it. Come back in here. There, see. Just let it play and have fun. There, look at that"
Bob Ross,"You know, Ive got several letters commenting on this easel that Im using in this series. This is a brand new easel that has just been released. Im very happy with this easel"
Bob Ross,"What makes it so great, the top comes off. If makes a wonderful table top easel with four legs instead of the traditional three. Its much stronger. It works for this kind of painting, very well"
Bob Ross,"There, little bit of that white, we can add just a little white around his foots. About like that. There, once again, no pressure, allow that paint just to break on there. Just allow it to break"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a happy little bush that lives right there. Maybe theres another one over in here. Just here and there, some little bushy things. There, a little touch there"
Bob Ross,"Take a liner brush, put some paint thinner on it. There, go right into that brown. And we can just snatch up a few little sticks and twigs, here and there"
Bob Ross,"But see, this painting was done with very, very few pieces of equipment. Very few colors of paint, theres not a lot to it, its easy. You can do this one"
Bob Ross,"Even if youve never painted, this is one that you can do. And your friends and your family, they wont believe you done it. They really wont"
Bob Ross,"In fact, Ive had people write and say their friends actually started looking for numbers on their painting, like it was a paint by number. They thought they just covered the numbers up"
Bob Ross,"Now you can go back in here, and here and there, put the indication of a few limbs and twigs and sticks and things, but I dont want these to be real smooth"
Bob Ross,"I want them rough, so they follow along with whats happening in this painting. Very rough, ragged. Wherever you think they should be. Gnarly, I like that world, gnarly. There we go. See there"
Bob Ross,"All kinds of hangy-downs. All kinds of em, wherever you think they should be. There. Alright. Mmm, yeah that looks like a Halloween picture to me. And we can put some out in here"
Bob Ross,"And at home, when you do this, take your time. Do a lot of these, they really, all these little hangy down things here are absolutely fantastic. Youll enjoy them"
Bob Ross,"They make your painting look like, once again, like you spent so much time on it. And only we know, that it was very easy. There, and if you enjoy success with this, you wont believe what you can do"
Bob Ross,"This just opens doors to a world of art, thatll take you places youve only dreamed about going. Alright, tell you what"
Bob Ross,"Think we about got a finished one here, lets take a little red, sign this one, and well call it done. Hope youve enjoyed it"
Bob Ross,"Id love to see some photographs of your work, if you have time, send me a couple. Let me see what youre doing. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,Interlude by Larry Owens
Bob Ross,- Hi. Certainly glad to see you today. I thought today wed just do a painting thats a lot of fun. Hope you have your paints out and your big brushes and youre ready to get along here with us
Bob Ross,"So I tell you what, lets start out today, have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us"
Bob Ross,"And while theyre doing that, as usual, let me show you what Ive got done up here. Today I have a standard ol canvas up here"
Bob Ross,"And Ive covered the top of the canvas with liquid white, the bottom with liquid black and Ive just blended them together. So you have a nice even flow of color here. It goes from white to black"
Bob Ross,"And its that easy. Shoot, lets have some fun today. I thought today, maybe, Lets just do a painting thats a lot of fun. Make you feel good in here. Start with a small amount of phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"Dont need much. Its very strong. Just a little. Just a tiny bit. Lets go up in here and lets just tap in all kinds of little just all kinds of little happy things. Tap, twirl, whatever"
Bob Ross,"Lets make a sky that has some life in it today. Just spin in all kinds of little little doers, like that. Were not too worried about em. Just have fun. Painting should make you happy"
Bob Ross,"Should be a good time when youre painting. There, see. Just sort of swirl it in. Let it go. Play with it. Reach over here and get a small amount of alizarin crimson right on the same brush"
Bob Ross,"Very small amount though. And that will give us sort of a reddish lavender, cause theres blue on there. And well let that bounce in here and there, wherever. Just a little. Just a little"
Bob Ross,And we can go back and get a little white here and there. Just a little white on the brush. And well just spin a little bit of that in there. Im just varying colors
Bob Ross,"I want a sky, I say that has a lot of little things happening in it. And each and every one of these will be different. Yours will be different than this one. The next one we do here will be different"
Bob Ross,"So dont try to just copy now. Let yours, let yours be an individual. There. Just blend that a little bit. And you can vary back and forth. Went back into a little blue there. There"
Bob Ross,The blue is much stronger than any other color up here. So you have to sort of keep that in mind. Itll get away from you sometimes if your not careful
Bob Ross,And phthalo blue is such a strong beautiful color. It might be just about my favorite color. There we go. There. Its quite a warm blue. Some blues are very cold feeling
Bob Ross,Have to put on a coat just work with em. Phthalo blue is a warm blue. Probably has a little green in it. Something like that. Thats probably all well need for that little sky
Bob Ross,"I with the brush, Im gonna put a little little prussian blue, and Im gonna go right over this dark color about like that. Just let it blend up with it"
Bob Ross,See how easy that is to cover when you have the black on there. This black works wonderful for areas that you know in your painting are gonna have a lot of dark in them. It work wonderful
Bob Ross,Now were gonna clean the brush. If youve painted with me before you know thats the most fun part of the whole technique
Bob Ross,"tapping chuckels And thats really the fun is just beatin the ol brush there. Tell you what, today lets have a little mountain that live way back in the oh its far away"
Bob Ross,"Take a little black, little alizarin crimson, little blue in it, something like that. Pull it out flat, cut across, get our little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,And maybe in our world a little mountain lives right there. I dont want much paint. Scrape off all the excess
Bob Ross,"In fact, if it bothers you to scrape, add a little white to it, so that way it wont be so dark. I dont mind scraping the canvas hard. There. Alright. Just as small amount of paint as you can put on"
Bob Ross,"Just enough to stain the canvas. Now, back to our two inch brush, and we want to grab this and pull it. Just pull it and then blend it outward. I want to make this very light"
Bob Ross,"The lighter a mountain is the farther away itll look in your painting. If its close to you, itll be very distinct and dark. I want this one to live way back somewhere, far away. So its very light"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Something about like that. And we just blend in the entire thing a little to bring it together. Okay. Okay, thats all. Little white, just a little"
Bob Ross,Maybe I put the least little touch of the bright red in it. Just enough to warm it up a little. We have a little pink in the sky so well have a little of that in here
Bob Ross,"Cut off our little roll of paint. Okay. Now I dont want a lot of detail back here so just put the tiniest little bit of color on here, little bit of white. Dont want much though"
Bob Ross,"Once again, I want this to look far away. So I dont want a lot of detail in it. Just enough to give the indication that theres a big mountain living back here"
Bob Ross,I dont even know what well do in the foreground exactly yet but well come up with something. Dont worry about it. Thats whats so great about this style of painting
Bob Ross,You can literally start off and only have a time of year in mind. Thats really all you need. And time of day probably just to determine where your light is coming from
Bob Ross,"But other than that, you really dont have to make any major decisions when you first start. And I like that because probably halfway through Ill probably change my mind anyway"
Bob Ross,"Little blue, prussian blue, little white. Maybe a little more white. Lighten it up. Oh, thats just perfect. Little roll of paint. Almost no color here. Just a hint. Just a hint"
Bob Ross,"Just to give a little, a little indication. Because Im probably going to take the little blender brush and blend this whole mountain to soften it. Im not trying to put much detail in it"
Bob Ross,Little blender brush. And very lightly. Following the basic angles
Bob Ross,"This little blender brush, the hair in it is so soft you could paint right over this firm paint, as long as its very gentle, without destroying it. There, soften it. Blend it. There we are. Alright"
Bob Ross,"We just pushed that little mountain back about five or six miles right on back there. Now then, lets go into it. Well just use that blue that we had right here. Just tap that brush right into it"
Bob Ross,"Same old bluish color. Go up in here. Now then, Im want to just take some of these angles and begin coming downward with them. Make all kinds of shapes. Grab another brush. I want to do something"
Bob Ross,"Take the least little bit, least little bit of indian yellow, least little bit, least little bit, and just blend it up. Just had an idea. I think if thats there, watch here, watch here"
Bob Ross,Itll create all kinds of little things happening down in here when you come across. Cause this yellow along this blue is gonna give us a basic little green color. Sneaky huh
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little doer that come down from here. Comes up like that. We dont know. And then lift upward. Make it look like theres little trees living back here far away, far, far away"
Bob Ross,"Just little devils. Put a little black with that color. But just a small amount, maybe. Maybe theres another little doer. Yep, your right. And he comes right up in through here. Lift it up. There"
Bob Ross,Just let your imagination take you wherever you want to be here. All these little hills and stuff that live back in here. You can have them. You can have em wherever you want em. There we are. There
Bob Ross,"See just vary a lot of these colors and lift. That lifting though, once again will make you look like little trees that live far away, far, far away. Alright. tapping Another brush to clean and dry"
Bob Ross,Now I want to create mist so Im going to tap the base of all this. But just the base. And you can even add a little titanium white to your brush if you really want to create mist
Bob Ross,"But just a tiny bit, tiny bit. And make all kinds of little, little soft areas in here. There we go. Wherever you think they should live, thats exactly where they should live"
Bob Ross,I like to make paintings sometimes that are very soft and very gentle. They dont show up to well on T. V. so most of them we do on T. V. are a little brighter. But they are still a lot of fun to do
Bob Ross,"When you are at home, try some of these. Lets go into, well theres some of that lavender color we had made the mountain out of. I think that was some black, alizarin crimson"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna put some sap green in it, little blue. Somethin about like that, let me get a little white, be right back, oh yeah, nice color, nice color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little black in there too just, yeah, perfect. Okay, tap the brush. Get a little paint on it. Maybe in our world, maybe, yeah. Yeah, youre right"
Bob Ross,"I want to make the indication here of some little foothills. Some little foot-y hills that live right along, right along where they live. Make a big decision. You decide where they live"
Bob Ross,"But just all kinds of little, like little trees, that live far up on a hill. Now notice, each layer is a getting a little more distinct, a little more detail in it. There we go. Clean, dry brush"
Bob Ross,"tapping And were gonna tap the base of this, firmly using the top corner of the brush. Firmly though. Firmly. I want to create that illusion of mist under there. Lift upward"
Bob Ross,"See how soft that becomes. You can do that. Same color. Same color only darker. Little sap green, little black, little blue, little crimson. But darker"
Bob Ross,"Each layer as it gets closer to you should get darker. Yep, here we go. All kind of little things living right up in here. There. Theres many, many ways of making foothills"
Bob Ross,"But this is one of the easiest, most effective, that Ive come up with. Try it. Try it before the series is over. Well show you several different ways of making these. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Just have to decide where this one goes. I dont know, maybe it goes all the way over here. Dont know if we even care at this point. We only make one decision at a time here"
Bob Ross,Alright back to our brush. Were using it to create mist. tapping And just mist the base of it. Just really get in there and mist it. Somethin about like that. There. Aint that neat
Bob Ross,"But already you can see plains just one after the other all the way up through this mountain. Theres already a lot of depth in this and youve done very, very little. Shoot that was fun"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna do it one more time. Same colors. Same colors but less and less white. Each time less white. So once again, it gets darker and darker as it gets towards you, comes towards you. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this one, thats almost the pure color. Not quite. A little white in it but not a lot. And Im using just the corner of the brush here and make some very basic little shapes"
Bob Ross,"Im not looking for detail. Its too far away. Its much, much too far away. You dont see every little leave in a tree this far away. There. About like that. brush strokes There"
Bob Ross,"While I got that color on the brush, maybe theres water back here. Well pull a little of that down. Just pull it straight down, like that"
Bob Ross,Reflections are one of my absolute favorite things to do in this technique. Well put a little white on the brush too. That will make them sparkle. Just a little though. Dont overdo. Dont overdo
Bob Ross,"It gets working and it feels good and the next thing you know, youve overdone it. Now go across very lightly, just enough to sort of move everything. About like that"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little light spot out in here. Its up to you. Just a little shimmer across the water. You can do all these things that easy. That easy. There. Okay, sometimes, there"
Bob Ross,The least little touch of pink in that. Just to reflect some of that color out in the sky. Not much though. Least little touch. Least little touch there
Bob Ross,But keep these strokes straight so your water looks like its level. Otherwise itll sort of go away and leave you
Bob Ross,"Take that same ol dirty brush go into a little sap green, some of the yellows, yellow ochre, indian yellow, all of them. I want to make a little green color"
Bob Ross,"In my mind, this area right here is beginning to get close enough to us that we can make out color. Im not making a lot of detail yet. But were getting some basic colors, shape, form"
Bob Ross,"Once again, were not getting a lot of detail yet. Too much detail can be disturbing to the eye"
Bob Ross,"Because even if youre not aware of it, your mind knows that things that are far away you cant see a lot of detail in. Sometimes youre not aware of that, consciously, but subconsciously you are"
Bob Ross,"I dont know if that makes any sense but I know youve looked at paintings and youd say, Somethings wrong with that painting. I dont know what it is"
Bob Ross,But something bothers my eye about that painting.  And it can be something as simple as that. There we go. Im just taking a little fan brush with a little green on it
Bob Ross,And just sort of pushing upward just a little. Let me put a little liquid white on there to thin it. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint
Bob Ross,And I also want it to be a little lighter in color so it shows up a little better. So the liquid white really accomplishes that very easy. There. About like that
Bob Ross,Little more of the liquid white on the knife. Put the least little touch of bright red in it. Just the least little touch. And well just take here and cut in a water line. Just cut it in
Bob Ross,"Its just sort of a light area to break up between the darks. About like that. There. Alright. We dont even know where that goes over there. At this point, we dont even care. Dont even care"
Bob Ross,"There, a little, few little ripples on the water here and there. All those nice things. Find a fan brush. Liquid white. Okay, fan brush, liquid white, titanium white"
Bob Ross,"I put the liquid white in there, once again, only the thin the titanium white. Be right back. Get a little blue. A very small amount of the phthalo blue. Ready to have some fun. Lets do it"
Bob Ross,Its your bravery test. Pretend youre water and youre floating along here one day. You just having a good time. Youre not bothering anybody. Its a wonderful day
Bob Ross,Youre just floating along enjoying the scenery and all the sudden somebody pulled the stopper right out of your world and- spews and it goes over. And there it goes. Just let it come right over
Bob Ross,spews But if it goes straight and then down doesnt matter where you go here. Well cover any of that up that we dont like. Itll give the impression of water thats falling over
Bob Ross,"The best reason they call it a waterfall. Lets take a little bit of brown paint, straight van dyke brown. I just want to put some dark in here. Well put a lot of nice rocks in this"
Bob Ross,But I just want some dark right along in here to get us started. grunts Really get in there and mash it in. Im gonna have some fun today. Let me clean off a spot to work
Bob Ross,"Lets take black, little bit of prussian blue, little brown, maybe a even a little bit of crimson in it. And Im going to take paint thinner and Im going to thin this color till its quite thin"
Bob Ross,"Quite thin. Just use paint thinner, plain ol paint thinner, preferably odorless. Or youll be working alone. And just mix it till its nice and thin"
Bob Ross,"Now then, I want to take white and a little bit of black to make a grey or theres a little bit of blue there too. Guess we dont have a little blue in there too"
Bob Ross,But mostly black and white to make a nice grey color. About like that. Maybe a little darker. Perfect. Let me get a little thinner. I want this to be thin also
Bob Ross,"Now you remember our golden rule, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So all Im doing here, is making us some thin paint. so itll stick to all that thick that we have up there already. Okay"
Bob Ross,Wipe off the ol knife. Lets get us a little oval brush. Oval brushes are easy to distinguish. They are the only brush we have that has a black handle
Bob Ross,"And I did that intentionally so you wouldnt get them confused. Load both sides full of color. See, both sides. Now,take one side, only one, and go through that light color. Dark, light. Now watch"
Bob Ross,"Up here in our world lives a big ol rock, big ol rock, right there. See. Hes got a friend there. Alright. Now lets just have some fun. Here comes one, comes right over. Here he comes. Zoom"
Bob Ross,"This is the nicest, easiest way I have ever found of making some gorgeous rocks. Now then, lets have some fun. Lets take black, some prussian blue, little sap green. Let me get some phthalo green"
Bob Ross,I like phthalo green in there. In our world. You ready. There lives. Decide where. Right there. One big evergreen tree. And when we said big today we mean big evergreen tree. Pushing upward
Bob Ross,Just pushing upward. There it comes. Big tree. Big tree. Here he comes. There. I didnt realize how big that tree was. But thats okay. In our world we can have a tree any size that we want
Bob Ross,If Id have known it was gonna be that big Id have probably used a two inch brush to have made it easier. Now that same brush go into a little yellow. A little yellow ochre just mix them together
Bob Ross,"We can go back and put in a few little highlights. Dont want a lot. Keep these trees basically, basically, dark. Basically dark, some light. Take a two inch"
Bob Ross,"Well go in that same color, the black, the blue, little sap green, or phthalo green. Yep, right there lives a bush. We can just drop him right in there like that. Just fill that all in"
Bob Ross,"Over here on the other side. Ah, be brave. Using the corner of the brush well just drop in another one. Wherever you think they should be. Just drop them in. Just sort of fill all this up"
Bob Ross,"Just fill it up. There they come. There they come. All were doing is putting in some darks so our light will show. And this liquid black, really makes that easy. Really makes it much easier here"
Bob Ross,"Here comes one, yep right over the waterfall. Well go through some of that yellow, little sap green on the brush. We can just use a two inch brush. One direction. And go right above here"
Bob Ross,You could do this with a one inch. Im doing it with a two inch today. Doesnt matter. Put a little liquid white on the brush. Needs to be a little touch there so it will stick
Bob Ross,"Very quickly, very quickly, you get a feel for this. As soon as you touch the canvas you know, you know. See there, darker, darker, darker down here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe in here, here right there lives another happy little tree. Notice Im making this one with the corner of the brush. The other one I made by pushing upward"
Bob Ross,"Just so theres some variations in your world. We want all kinds of little different things happening. There they go. Indian yellow, yellow ochre, every once in while a little touch of that bright red"
Bob Ross,Give it a little fire. Little bit of fire makes your painting look nice. There. There we go. Little bit right in here. Like that. Wherever you think these things should be
Bob Ross,Just think of all the little bushes. And we can go back to our oval brush. Its got the dark paint thats thin. Light on one side
Bob Ross,"And here and there, put in an indication of another little rock or two wherever you think they should be. And in our world maybe they live all through here. Wherever. Dark on the bottom. Light on top"
Bob Ross,"And put a bunch of these in then well just go back, there, with our ol two inch brush, the ol two inch brush, and we just go in and fill in all the little holes now with all these little, all these"
Bob Ross,"little things that live in here. See em. Okay. The other side, put a few over here. There. One little bush at a time. There we are. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Little touch of the yellow ochre headed here and there just for a change of flavor. There we are. Oh, nice one there. Little sparkler. Little sparkler. Alright. Now we can go back to our fan brush"
Bob Ross,Has a little liquid white on it. Little bit of the phthalo blue. Lets splash a little water back in here. splash Got to make those little noises. Let our waterfall just sort of wander around
Bob Ross,Little splashes here and there. Let it go. Just let it go. Something about like that. And that easy. That easy. Shoot. Leave some little open spots. Looks like little pools in there. There we are
Bob Ross,"Okay. And I think with that. Shoot, well call that a finished painting. Hope you enjoyed this one. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. smooth jazz"
Bob Ross,"light music - Welcome back. Certainly glad to see you today. I thought today wed do a painting thats just, its a lot of fun, very simple, and I think youll enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"So lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this with me at home. While theyre doing that, let me show you what I got going up here today"
Bob Ross,"I have my standard old, well, Im using an 18 by 24 inch canvas, but you use any size that you like and all Ive done is covered the entire canvas with a very, very. Let me say it one more time"
Bob Ross,"A very thin coat of liquid clear. Now, the clears on here just to make the canvas wet and slick and thats really the only reason its there"
Bob Ross,"Be careful when youre using this clear because you cant see it up here hardly. Its hard to, its hard to tell if you have enough. If you have any doubt. Because usually, you put too much on"
Bob Ross,"If you have any doubt, take a paper towel and wipe it down. Whats left will be just right. Its better to have too litte than it is to have too much. You just wanna make the paint slide on there"
Bob Ross,"Lets have fun today. The old two-inch brush. And Im gonna use very, very little color. Pull the smallest little amount, smallest little amount of the blue out here. Little, tiny bit of blue"
Bob Ross,"Very small amount. Lets go up in here. Now, very gently Im just going to begin applying some color up here in the sky. I want the. Lets do a winter scene today"
Bob Ross,"So, lets make it very soft, very misty. One of those winter. Tell you what, lets get crazy. Lets get crazy today. Lets have a"
Bob Ross,Maybe a few little buildings down here like a little farm scene or something. I dont know. Just sort of do it and see what happens
Bob Ross,"It doesnt matter because as you know, in our world, we dont make mistakes. We just have happy accidents. Its the only world I live in where theres no mistakes at all"
Bob Ross,"Thats what makes it so wonderful. Very little color. Shoot, while I got that going, lets just keep going. Maybe well just put a little bit of this blue all over"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna have a winter scene and were gonna need some shadows in our snow, so by applying a little blue down here, well use that later on. Automatically, this will become our shadows"
Bob Ross,"And if worst comes to worst, what the heck. Well turn it into a nice lake or pond or whatever we want. Doesnt matter. Thats whats so nice about this. You can change your mind right mid-stream"
Bob Ross,"Okay, fun time. Fun time. Lets wash the brush. As you know, we wash our brush with odorless paint thinner. Shake it off. And just beat the devil out of it. Now, lets go back with titanium white"
Bob Ross,"First of all, the prussian blue is transparent. Its very transparent. Now, Im gonna go into an opaque color. The titanium white and it is very opaque. Very opaque"
Bob Ross,"Just a little color on here, and lets go up in here and lets just play a little bit. Lets just pick out some areas like this"
Bob Ross,"We want this painting, as I say, to be very soft, very gentle quiet little painting. I dont want a strong, distinct sky here that, that, will be distracting. I want a very gentle, quiet little sky"
Bob Ross,"And so thats what we shall have. There. In our world, we can create any illusion that we want. And today, I want softness in our world. Tranquility, quiet. Peaceful"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, theres too much bad stuff going on in our world. Were gonna have a very peaceful place. Everybodys happy, even the little creatures. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Thats really, thats really about all I want for this sky. I dont wanna do much more than that. Something about like that. And I get to wash the brush again. All right"
Bob Ross,"I really, really just wanted to wash the brush. Shake it off. laughs You know they. If youre gonna do this at home, I suggest you get a little thing called a brush meter rack"
Bob Ross,"It goes down in a garbage can, cause if you do this in your living room, youre not gonna be very popular. Guarantee. Guarantee. All right. Lets go into a little black"
Bob Ross,"Very small amount of blue, but theres very little paint. Very little paint here, and I just wanna tap in some little indications, barely touching the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Little indications far away, far away, almost the same color as the sky. Very light, far away. Remember that. I keep saying it because its important. Now, you can take this"
Bob Ross,I wanna blend the edges out so it just disappears. Just sort of disappears softly. Softly
Bob Ross,"I dont do a lot of soft paintings on television cause they dont show up quite as well, but I thought today, well do one anyway. There. Softly"
Bob Ross,"If you want to make this sort of look like it just, I dont know, like it sort of flows, almost like a watercolor, leave a little more paint thinner on your brush because paint thinner and liquid"
Bob Ross,"clear, they have a violent reaction and itll sort of just grow and its beautiful. Looks like watercolor. There. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Thats a little background or something thats way back here. We dont even care where its at. Far away. Lets have one in the foreground, a little closer to us"
Bob Ross,"Well use the same color, only a little more paint and Ill add the least, least little touch of Van Dyke brown to it. But theres still not a great deal of paint on the brush. Not a great deal"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here. Tell you what, let me show you something. Im gonna take just the least little touch of paint thinner"
Bob Ross,Remember I told you that paint thinner and liquid clear have a violent reaction. Wipe off all the excess. Dont want much
Bob Ross,"Then we just sort of tap all these colors together and right here, lets just begin tapping in some basic little shapes. Very, very basic. Theres paint thinner in here. Not a lot"
Bob Ross,"I wiped all of it off, as you saw, that I could get off, but I didnt beat the brush. So theres still some in here. Were just putting indication of all kinds of little things that live up in here"
Bob Ross,"There. All right. Whats the old saying. You dont have to be crazy to do this, but it helps. Sometimes it does. You really. This is where you enjoy freedom on canvas. Just let things happen"
Bob Ross,"Let them happen. There. Now, this will continue to dilute the paint thinner. Will continue to dilute the liquid clear and youll get reactions maybe for several hours"
Bob Ross,"Itll be very slight, but itll be a little bit different. Let me show you. Watch here. You can even take a little paint thinner on the fan brush and flick it. Look at that. Look at that"
Bob Ross,Isnt that gorgeous. Look at those effects. It makes one of the neatest little nicest things and all you gotta do. See. Just flick it
Bob Ross,"And you can use the knife to flick it or Im just using the side of the palette, whatever. Doesnt matter. But thatll continue to work. It looks. Once again, it looks like a watercolor. All right"
Bob Ross,"Lets put another little bush. Same colors. Just tapping. Each layer gets a little bit darker as it gets closer to us. And maybe in our world, theres one more little tree lives right here"
Bob Ross,"We dont know. Dont know that we even care at this point in our life. There. Just make all kinds of little things. Okay. Yep, theres another one there. Heres one here"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes you can just take and push sidewards, create all kind of little illusions here. Is that another one. Then Ill take it and pull it. Lift it. See there. Pull those little things out"
Bob Ross,"That paint thinner and clear will continue to work for a while once again. I like these kind of little paintings. Theyre so soft. So nice. Theyre very moody little paintings. Yeah, there we are"
Bob Ross,"Okay. And that gives us a fairly good little background. You can enhance that a little, taking a little paint thinner, a little pit of white paint. Put a little blue in it too just to dull it a little"
Bob Ross,"And maybe, in our world, maybe theyre some little tree trunks that live up through here. Just a few. There we are. See. You can pull it down, you can lift it up. Whatever works well for you"
Bob Ross,Few little things in here. You can actually just take plain paint thinner and do this
Bob Ross,"Itll lift the paint off the canvas, and you can get basically the same effect by just allowing the canvas to show through. There. All kinds of little doers happening"
Bob Ross,"Now, we decided early that this was gonna be winter. Lets get the bravery test out here. Well go right into titanium white. Titanium white. Lets go up in here. Where is the snow"
Bob Ross,"The easiest way there ever was to make snow. There. Just like it. And it goes makes painting noise right on across. I dont know. Now see, intentionally, I went around this tree"
Bob Ross,"Now it looks like this tree is forward. Does that make any sense. I hope Im saying that right so you understand. Sometimes I get so excited, I, I dont say things right"
Bob Ross,"But thats just a neat effect, aint it. Look at that. Its setting down in the snow. Right out there. Lets see. We decided we was gonna have some buildings out here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe one of the easiest ways that Ive found to make a building is take the knife, and just firmly scrape out a basic shape. It does two things. Most important, it removes excess paint"
Bob Ross,"Secondly, it allows you to lay out your buildings. Lets put a shed on this one. What the heck. Maybe thats an old barn with a shed on it. Like it. But you can lay out a whole series of buildings"
Bob Ross,"Maybe therere more than one. Right there. We dont care. Without being committed, anyway, thats what Im trying to say. Youre not committed at this point. There"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little Van Dyke, little dark cyan, and mix it together. Van Dyke and dark cyan. Im just gonna use them together. And now, we can figure out here where the dark part is"
Bob Ross,"And in my world, I think its right here. You dont have to stay in the lines that you scraped out. You can go anywhere you want with this"
Bob Ross,"Every person whos ever painted has a different opinion of why it works and how it should work, but I believe that its an individual thing, and if youre happy with your painting, then the worlds"
Bob Ross,"happy with it. Whats the old saying about if you smile, the world smiles with you and all that. Same thing here. We were gonna have a shed here. Forgot. There. Now, we can come back"
Bob Ross,"Still using a knife, take a little bit of paint, and maybe, maybe this building here is straight on. Let me get a little more paint there. Straight on toward us"
Bob Ross,"And sort of allow that to break sometimes. Makes it looks like the snow sorta sliding down. makes sliding sounds Straight down. Woops, got a little doer hanging off there. There. All right"
Bob Ross,A little bit more here for the little shed. There he is. Looks like icicles right there already. There. Something about like it. And thats quick enough to give us an idea of a little building
Bob Ross,"And we take a little brown and a little white, mix them together. Little brown, little white. Ooh, thats nice. Dont overmix. Touch. Just pull gently down"
Bob Ross,"In my mind, I think this little shed is not gonna get as much light, so its gonna be a little darker back here. So Ill make it a little darker so hes pushed back a little more"
Bob Ross,"I think in my mind this side of the house will be a little lighter than the front or the barn, whatever this is. I dont know what it is. Whatever you want it to be. A little more brown in there"
Bob Ross,"This side over here now is very dark in comparison. Its sorta, this is sorta like a three-quarter view. All right. Clean off the knife"
Bob Ross,"Choose a little edge and maybe theres a few little windows in here. Just doop, doop, three. There. See. Whole line of little windows. Maybe the cows live in here and need a place to look out"
Bob Ross,They wanna see whats happening out here too. There. Well put a couple little windows in there. Its your world. You decide whats in there and whats not
Bob Ross,"As Ive mentioned many times before, I sort of make up little stories in my mind. Im just pulling a little brown through there to make it look like old boards living in there"
Bob Ross,"But these little stories, they really help me. I dont know if theyll help you, but I believe they will. Make up little stories about your world. Boy, thats some rough looking snow there"
Bob Ross,Old snow laying up there. We need snow on this other building. makes swooping noises There we are. Little bit there. All right
Bob Ross,"Now, sometimes when you have the clear there this doesnt want to stick too good. If thats the case, add a little liquid white to make your paint a little thinner. Then itll stick"
Bob Ross,"Its all you have to do. Over here on this side, put a little snow out there. Little touch of brown, for the eve or the overhang. Like it. Shoot. Were bout to have an old building there"
Bob Ross,"And I want these to look like theyve, theyve had a rough life. Real rough life. Well take our big brush. Little bit of snow right there. Make a little shadow in the snow"
Bob Ross,All we have to do is put a little blue in there for that. Little darker blue. All right. Over here makes swooping noise. Cut that off like that. The side like it. Now were in business
Bob Ross,"So we have two little buildings out here. Little bit more of the blue color. I put some blue down here, but its not as dark as I want it to be. I want it to be a little bit darker"
Bob Ross,"So Ill just add a little more, because in our world, we can add anything that we want. There. Over in here. You know, a couple of shows ago, Ive mentioned something about this easel"
Bob Ross,We have a brand new easel in this series. And weve been absolutely flooded with requests wanting to know more about it. What can I tell you. Its a very unique easel
Bob Ross,"The greatest thing about it is the top comes off and makes a tabletop easel. It has four legs. Most tabletop easels have three. When you use a brush this big, you hit it, they fall over"
Bob Ross,"Thats always been a problem, so we designed an easel that has four legs for the tabletop. Then the nice thing about it, you can order it with just the top. You just want a tabletop"
Bob Ross,Then maybe later on you decide you wanna get serious about it. You can go back and order the bottom and they go right together. There. And it
Bob Ross,"Its available I think it most better art stores across the country. If you cant find one, drop me a line. Ill find out where they are and let you know. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Take a little blue, little white, mix them together. Maybe in our world. Lets put the indication of. Starts out here at nothing. Well just let it come round through here"
Bob Ross,"Just, maybe theres just an indication of a little path or road. Little road. Goes right through like that. Just a little dabble. Like it. Comes right off the edge of the canvas here"
Bob Ross,This is just blue and white. There we are. And well bring a little snow right up to it. Let it just disappear right off the edge. And you dont have to be careful or anything. You can clean that up
Bob Ross,"when you come back with the snow, you can clean up the edges. You dont have to worry about it. Just enjoy. Just enjoy. There"
Bob Ross,"Because maybe, maybe the winds blowing the snow half way over this little road. You just cant make out that theres a road there. The old cows in the barn"
Bob Ross,You gotta get up there and take him some hay. All right. Dont want the old cow left out. A little touch of the alizarin crimson into the. Least little touch into the white
Bob Ross,And maybe nice distinct something right there just to break it up. There we go. Little touch more of that crimson. That gives it a little warm effect. There
Bob Ross,"See, it creates a whole other plain there, even in the snow. You know, look at this. I think this farms deserted"
Bob Ross,"The more I look at it, the more I think I think this old farm were abandoned, this place. Yeah, all right. Lets take a little of that brown. Little paint thinner. Liner brush. Very thin paint"
Bob Ross,"Lot of it on the bristles. Liner brush holds a lot of paint. Maybe in our world. Yup, maybe theres an old fence left here. We can just do this with a little liner brush"
Bob Ross,"As they go away from you, let them get smaller and closer together. Closer together. There. See. And thatll help create that illusion of distance. Now, maybe theres a little snow on there"
Bob Ross,Ill just dip into a little bit of the liquid white. Just pure liquid white and well put the indication of a little snow hanging up here on some of these. There
Bob Ross,"makes dropping sounds There they are. Gotta make those little noises though, or it wont work. Take just the knife and Ill go through a little bit of brown. Use just the heel of the knife"
Bob Ross,"makes swooshing noise Go right down, well put a little wire on that fence. Just the heel. So, let it get wider as it comes forward. There. Two strands of wire. That easy. That easy"
Bob Ross,Wish it was that easy to put that wire on your house. Maybe theres a. Theres another old post up here. I dont know. Some kind of big old post that lives there. Little liquid white
Bob Ross,"Need a little something hanging on him. Sometimes its nice to add a little blue to the liquid white. Itll make your snow look colder. Much, much colder. Lets use a one-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna go into a little white, a little bit of the blue. Little white, little bit of blue. I want this to be sort of a, a medium blue"
Bob Ross,"In our world, maybe theres a few little bushes that live back here. Im just looking for a little dark color to make some light show up. Maybe theres a happy bush lives there. Looks like a tree"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe theres another one right in here. I dont know. Maybe this gentleman takes care of his yard like I did and the bushes and the trees are growing up and taking over his farm"
Bob Ross,"Now, another white or another one-inch brush going to liquid white. Now, most important how you load this brush. Come right down here and watch here. Pull that brush in one direction"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that a great close up. That is fantastic. Pull that brush in one direction. Load a lot of color in it. Watch. Now, Im gonna turn it over. See how thats rounded"
Bob Ross,"You want that rounded corner to go to the top. You can also see right there, we just taped this furrows. I had people write in and they say how come your brush looks different than mine"
Bob Ross,We put a little tape on those furrows just to keep them from shining on TV. Its identical to your brush. Guarantee
Bob Ross,"Now, with that nice, white color, all you gotta to is just go up here and barely touch. Just barely touch. Well put a few highlights on these snow covered now. There. Over in here"
Bob Ross,"Just a few little things. Dont want a lot. Just a few. Just a few. Now, my brush has got white on. Itll work just as well. Come in here. And with that, you can very gently clean up the bottom"
Bob Ross,Sort of begin to bring all this together. Just using white paint. There. Pull that out. See there
Bob Ross,"We didnt add a simple and super little, little way to do, maybe like a little farm scene in the winter"
Bob Ross,"Now, if you live some place where theres a lot of farms, you can look around and see the type of farms that are in your area and paint them to match what youre used to seeing. Its up to you"
Bob Ross,"Its really up to you. I just wanna show you how to do this. What you do is very individual. All right. Something like so. Okay. Shoot, I think we about got it here. You might take"
Bob Ross,"Lets say this guy didnt keep his grass cut very good, so maybe around here, we can put a few little sticks and twigs around some of these posts"
Bob Ross,They usually grow there because you cant cut close to them. There. Something like it
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little red, a little paint thinner, thin it down til its the consistency, almost the consistency of ink and lets sign this little rascal right there. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"If your paints very thin, itll flow right over the top of this thick paint. That easy. Hope youve enjoyed this one. Its a very, very simple little painting"
Bob Ross,"If youve never painted before, this one you can do. From all of us there, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. mellow music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, cause its a fantastic day here. And I hope it is wherever youre at"
Bob Ross,"Today, I thoubght wed do something thats just a little bit different, but, as usual, Ill start out and run all the colors across the screen. Theyll come right there. So you can paint along at home"
Bob Ross,"Today, I have an oval. This is an oval canvas, and you can purchase these at any art dealer in the country, I guess. Its just an oval canvas. Normally, we make a lot of ovals and we use contact paper"
Bob Ross,"Today, I thought wed just make the oval itself. Something just a little more interesting, isnt it. Its very interesting when you hang these in your house"
Bob Ross,They do make oval frames that fit these so theyre gorgeous
Bob Ross,"Ive covered the entire little oval with a thin, even coat of liquid white, so its all wet and ready to go, and lets just have some fun today. Lets start with our little two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Im going to a small amount of the indian yellow. Very, very small amount. I dont need much. Just tap the brush into it a little bit. Okay, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Lets just make a little painting on this oval thats very warm. Well use. Lets just use all nice earth tones, browns, and a very, very warm little painting. One thatll. itll make you feel good"
Bob Ross,"And thats what paintings all about. Well just start out making a little doer like that. Take a little yellow ochre. I didnt clean the brush, a little yellow ochre, and well go right around that"
Bob Ross,Were making little tiny criss-cross strokes because theyre easier to blend out than if you make a big circle. So make little criss-cross strokes. Make your life easier
Bob Ross,"Were looking for easy ways to paint here. We want things to work very, very easy. There. And you can take this out to wherever you want it. Its up to you. Totally, and completely, up to you"
Bob Ross,There we go. Maybe about to there. Well come back in a minute and blend all this together. There we are. We have somethin for the Museum of Modern Art already. We can stop right there
Bob Ross,"Now then, Ive made a brown color today by mixing alizarin crimson, and sap green together in about equal proportions. And I just pre-mixed that to save a few minutes"
Bob Ross,"Its just these two colors mixed together. It makes a very warm brown, and you can take it to the reddish side or the greenish side. Up to you. There we are"
Bob Ross,"I sorta like mine to the reddish side a little bit, once in a while, so. If you want to add more, you can just reach over here and get a little of the red and add it right in there"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here. Now, around this edge, Im just going to begin blending that same color all the way around, like that. All the way around, we dont care. Wherever, well go all the way out to the"
Bob Ross,"Now, make it just a little bit darker than you want it to be because its gonna continually mix with the liquid white thats on the canvas, and automatically, your colors gonna get a little bit"
Bob Ross,"lighter. There. Yeah. While I have a little brown on there, lets just do somethin like this. This is just the brown made from crimson and sap green. Thats all it is. About like that"
Bob Ross,"Thats what were looking for. Now, fun time, let me wash the ole brush. I just like to wash the brush. Okay, we wash our brush with odorless paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"In the bottom of this little bucket here, theres a screen that I scrub the bristles against. That allows the solid materials to sort of settle to the bottom"
Bob Ross,"brush beats on bucket Kick the bucket, there. chuckle If your solid material settles to the bottom, then it keeps your paint thinner relatively clean"
Bob Ross,"Okay, Im going to a little bit of titanium white. Just in the corner of the brush. Start right here in the center, and begin working around. All the way around"
Bob Ross,"Work outward, continually blending outward. We start in the light area, and work toward the dark. If you reverse that, youre gonna lose your nice, light area in the center"
Bob Ross,"Just blend this out until its nice and smooth, and you cant tell where one color stops and the next color starts. There, something about like that. There we are. Okay"
Bob Ross,Im just beating the brush to remove any excess paint off of it. Then we can blend the entire sky area. Were basically in business. Thats all Im gonna do for this little sky. Its very simple
Bob Ross,"It works well, and its gorgeous. And we get to wash the brush again. Thats really the most fun part of this whole technique. There. All right. Lets take. Lets take a little brown"
Bob Ross,"Thats the same brown we made, thats the only brown were using today. Its just the crimson and the sap green. Be right back, Im gonna get a little white to mix with it"
Bob Ross,"So, we make a light color brown, about like a, maybe a little more white. Let me wipe the knife. And today, Ill tell you, lets use a fan brush. Im gonna load both sides full of color"
Bob Ross,"Just work it right through the paint. About like that. Let me get a little more white. I want that a little lighter. Yeah. Maybe even. Shoot, lets get crazy. Add a little bit of yellow ochre to it"
Bob Ross,"I like that better, its warmer. Okay lets go up in here. Now, maybe in our world here, theres a little tree line, and it comes right here, and all were gonna do is just begin tapping the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Thats all there is to it. There. See. Just tap these in, and I want them to just sort of disappear out here on the edge. The color is almost the same there. Almost the same. There we go"
Bob Ross,"All were doing is just tapping downward with the fan brush. Very, very easy. Even if youve never painted, this one you can do. Its a very easy little painting. Okay, a little more color"
Bob Ross,Maybe these go. We dont know. On over here somewhere. You make the big decision. Whats fun about painting is you get to control complete worlds here. Okay back to my two-inch brush
Bob Ross,"brush beats against bucket Now, all I want to do, is just tap it. Tap it so this blends right out"
Bob Ross,"You can even tap a little bit of titanium white on your brush if you want to create a more distinct, misty area. Tap it in that easy. Up to you. All right"
Bob Ross,"Now Maybe, in our world, let me get a little bit more brown on my brush. Maybe theres another layer of little trees and stuff that live back here in the background"
Bob Ross,"As things get closer to you in the landscape, you want to get darker, and darker, so we just add a little more brown to that same color. Load the fan brush back up"
Bob Ross,"These trees in my mind are a little closer so were gonna see a little more detail. Take the corner of the brush, just the corner, and begin working down the tree. Down, down, down, like that"
Bob Ross,"Just like that. We just put in a few little indications here. Corner of the brush. As you work down, apply more pressure. Youre bending the bristles downward. Forcing them downward. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Lets have one more, what the heck. Just make a little clump of trees here. And, maybe, in our world, youre right. Theres one. You just decide where they live. Drop em in. Drop em in"
Bob Ross,"Theres another one. Turn the brush over, use the other side. You can use both sides. Were not concerned in here. All were looking for is basic shape. Basic shape"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a big one that lives here. Big ole, strong tree. There he comes. They live right here in your fan brush. Sometimes you have to sort of scare em out. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Its working so well, no use stopping now. Once again, you decide how many trees live in your world. Heres little bushy areas back here"
Bob Ross,"Take that same color on the knife, and just put the indication of little things that are happening in between. This is how you turn a few trees into a lot of trees. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now, were not sure how many trees live in that clump. Same thing over here. Just here and there. Tell you what, lets go to the two-inch brush. Were going to some brown, a little white in it"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, this comes. Yep. Yep, youre right. Right over like that. Well need a little place for all those little trees to stand. And there it is. About like that"
Bob Ross,"Okay, while we got that ole brush going, Im gonna get into a little yellow, get a little sap green on the brush. Same ole brush, I havent cleaned it"
Bob Ross,"I want to colors to stay in the earth tones, so I dont want to get them too dark. I want them light, airy. When you do yours, you decide what color you want. Lets go back up in here. Same ole brush"
Bob Ross,"Well just tap in some nice little highlights on this. Just nice little highlights. Yellow ochre, indian yellow, cadmium yellow, little sap green. Just whatever. You make the decision. There"
Bob Ross,"I know, I know. I know, I know. Sometimes you see things. If you have this little opening right here, youd have to put a little cabin, right there. Now scrape out a basic little shape. There"
Bob Ross,"And we scrape it just to remove excess paint. Give us a general idea of where were going. And well take a little brown, and lets begin. Lets begin figuring out all of our little angles"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Tchoom. Over on this side, maybe it comes out here, like that. I dont know. Its up to you. Down under here. Tchoom. Here we are. And then down, tchoom"
Bob Ross,"At this point, youre not committed. I know. Maybe. Yep, lets get crazy. Maybe theres a little, maybe a little shed on this cabin. You need a place to put your tools. Right there"
Bob Ross,"Or your fish and tackle. Id rather put my fish and tackle in there. All right. Well take a little brown, lets get some bright red. Nice color. Just makes you feel good"
Bob Ross,"Bright red, white, a little of that brown we made. Dont over mix it. Leave it marbel-ley, if thats a word. Cut off a little row of paint"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up here, and just let that bounce, right down the side. soft clicking sounds So it looks like, maybe, old shingles that are falling off the roof. Times are hard out here. Real hard. There"
Bob Ross,"I like to make old buildings and stuff that look like theyve had a rough life. There. Okay. Maybe, Ill tell you what. Take a little white, a little of the brown, without the red in it"
Bob Ross,"And with that, Tchoom. Just put the indication of some highlights there. And, a little bit more in there. Making the front a little brighter, so it stands out"
Bob Ross,"Wipe off the ole knife, and you take a little of that brown paint on the edge of the knife, and just make it look like old boards that live in there. See there. Just old boards"
Bob Ross,"Now, back to our roof color, and lets put a roof right here on this little shed, see. soft clicking sounds Gotta make those little noises, or it doesnt work. Just brown and white again. Tchoom"
Bob Ross,"Leave a little bit out there. tchoom-tchoom-tchoom. Well put some little board in there like that. Shoot, thats about to give us a basic little shape there"
Bob Ross,"About there, and you can just use he brush to cut off wherever you want it. Like there. Tell you what, lets take a little brown, on the small edge of the knife. Tchoom"
Bob Ross,Just put a little window in there. Maybe one right there. That easy. That easy. All right. Back to all of our little colors. Just begin working it down like that
Bob Ross,"Take the ole two-inch brush, little bit of that brown on it, and here and there we can just tap in using the top corner. Indication of some little bushes that live in there. Wherever. Wherever. There"
Bob Ross,"Very soft, very gentle. Now then. Back to my brush that has some of that brown we made on it. Lets pull it straight down. Tchoom. Well make a little reflection right there in the water"
Bob Ross,Straight down. Its most important that it goes straight down. And then go across. It creates that illusion of a reflection that lives right there. That easy. That easy
Bob Ross,"Well, while we got that ole brown brush going here, you ready. Maybe in our world there lives just a big ole. Ooh there goes a nice evergreen. But its not wasted, because we learned how to make em"
Bob Ross,"Any time you learn, it certainly is not failure. There, all right. See. Just use the top corner of that ole brush. We can tap an indication here and there. Just a big ole tree that lives out here"
Bob Ross,"Down in here, Im gonna go into a little bit of the midnight black. I want it to be darker in here. Deep shadow. Deep shadow in there. Maybe it comes all the way down"
Bob Ross,"I dont know, you make the decision. There. Lets bring it all the way down into the front. Its our world, and we can do anything here that we want to do"
Bob Ross,"This is that brown we made with just a little black in it, to darken it. All right. In this painting, one thing I like about it, is it uses a very limited palette"
Bob Ross,"By limited palette, that means very, very few colors. Very few colors. Its not something that you have to have a million colors to do. There. You can do this one. Very easy"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a liner brush. going to a little bit of dark with one side, and, lets see. Let me get a little liquid white up here. Okay, a little of the dark color"
Bob Ross,"Then one side of it only, throw a little bit of light color. We can go in here, and this just creates the indication of little stones. Thin paint"
Bob Ross,"And it just like we do with a little filbert, only you can do it with the liner, and it looks like little stones that live all back in here. Tiny little things. There. Okay, lets take a"
Bob Ross,"Well I got a number 3 fan brush here. Well load one side with dark. Then Ill come right over here, get a little of the light color. On one side only. So, youve got light, dark. Lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe we can make out the indication of a few little tree trunks that live back in here. Just here and there, theres a few. Just a few little happy things"
Bob Ross,"Back to our liner brush, and Im adding paint thinner. Cause a thin paint, as you know, will go over the top of the thick paint, without mixing so bad. Turn that brush"
Bob Ross,"It brings it to a nice, sharp point. Holds a lot of paint. See there. You can see it"
Bob Ross,"Now, with that, we can go back in here, and put the indication of a few old limbs and branches that live out there in our world. Just a few. Here and there. Some of them show, some of them dont"
Bob Ross,"Its up to you. Shoot, Ill just use a ole two-inch brush, it doesnt make any difference. Whatever works for you. Little bit of green, sap green. Little bit of yellow"
Bob Ross,"Little yellow ochre, but mostly in the yellows. Okay lets go up in here. Maybe back in here well just have an indication of just a few highlights in some of these trees"
Bob Ross,"We dont want much, this is in the background. Just a few little things. Few little things. All right. Thats probably about enough of that, cause I want to put some trees, I think, in the foreground"
Bob Ross,"Get a little paint thinner in there. I want to thin that. Lets go into some yellow. Well use some cadmium yellow. All right. See, all Im doing is tapping the corner. You can see it very close"
Bob Ross,"Thats a beautiful close-up shot. Thanks, Kathy. All right, lets go right up in here. And maybe right up in here lives a little bush"
Bob Ross,"If you have trouble making the paint stick, all you need to do is add a little bit of paint thinner. A little bit of paint thinner. Doesnt take much. Or liquid white"
Bob Ross,"So you can dip it in the liquid white. liquid white, lets just do it. Itll make it a little bit brighter. There. All right. I think its time for a bravery test chuckle. You ready"
Bob Ross,All right lets go. Lets go into straight brown. That brown that we made. I want to put a little black in there too. I want it dark and strong. A lot of paint on the brush
Bob Ross,"All right, heres your bravery test. Tchoom. Ooh. Thats scary isnt it. Isnt that scary. Worked on it so long, and so hard, and some crazy guy tells you just to draw a big ole tree. Right there"
Bob Ross,Two of em. I like two. He needs a friend. There. All right. Well take a little touch of the white
Bob Ross,"And light seems to be coming from the left in this painting, so well take, and give it a little pull. Make this a little birch tree. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Titanium white, you can put a little brown in it if you want to. Just so it follows along with everything else in the painting. Little bit on this tree, here we go. There"
Bob Ross,"And sometimes you can see a little reflected light on the other side, its okay. You can make it any way you want it. Now, back to our liner brush. Little bit of the brown"
Bob Ross,"Needs to be very, very thin though. So itll flow right across there. Lot of paint in the brush. All right, lets go up in here. Maybe theres a big ole limb that lives. Yep, youre right"
Bob Ross,"Right out here. There we go. Lets see, this one needs an arm on him, too. We dont want him left out. Little ole trees gotta have an arm on him. Reach up here, gather the sunlight"
Bob Ross,"Birds gotta have a place to sit too. Shoot, you dont want them out here with no place to sit. All right. And when you do yours, you put as many limbs on your tree as you want"
Bob Ross,"I think today, Ill use the ole oval brush. Well put a little sap green on it. Maybe even a little of that brown to dull it, okay. And well go into our yellows. Here it is. There"
Bob Ross,"Little green, little yellow. Yellow ochre. All the yellows. Give it a little push. It loads a little ridge of paint right on the end. We can go up in here, and we just touch the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Tap in the indication of some little leaves that live out here. There, see. You decide where and how many. All right. Super little thing, thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Little oval brush works so good for these kind of things. Now, we can go right back in. Im gonna use the old two-inch brush. Thats working pretty good put a little paint thinner on it"
Bob Ross,"Just the top corner. Lets put the indication here and there, and there and here. Get a little red in there, too, of just some little bushes that live all down here"
Bob Ross,"Do one little bush at a time, dont get in a hurry. One little bush at a time. Just let these little rascals go. Theres another one"
Bob Ross,"See, by doing one at a time, it creates the illusion of depth and distance in your painting. Add a little sap green in there. Make a little darker color with this right in there. Something like so"
Bob Ross,"And this is a good way to clean up the foots of those trees. You just put a little bush in front of them, and then they fit. Then they fit. Lets have some fun today"
Bob Ross,"Every once in a while you need to get crazy. Put a little liquid white on the canvas. There. Maybe, and Im really not a floral painter, but maybe theres few little daisies out here"
Bob Ross,"We need Annette here to paint florals. Our partner, Annette, is one of the best floral painters in the country. Im gonna get her on here one day. Well have her just do some flowers"
Bob Ross,"Let you see how easy they can be. There. All right. You put as many as you want in there. Just some little indications, though. Look like little daisies or somethin that live out here"
Bob Ross,"And these are so simple to do. Anybody can do these little rascals. And well take a little red and yellow, mix it together. Make it look like orange. We just touch each one right in the center"
Bob Ross,"Give the indication of a little center button in daisies. Little bit of brown, here and there. We can put in some sticks, and twigs. Somethin about like that"
Bob Ross,"And you can always take the knife and cut in the sticks, just by scraping through the paint, wherever you think they should live. Shoot, I think we about got a little finished painting here"
Bob Ross,"So a very simple little painting, and on the oval, It makes it very unique. Its a wonderful gift to give to friends and relatives. Hope you try this one. Youll enjoy it, make you happy"
Bob Ross,"Well sign it, call it complete. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting. Thank you for being with us today, and God bless, my friend. Light jazz music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad to see you today. I thought today, wed do the little painting that you see at the opening of each show"
Bob Ross,"So lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what I got up here. I have my standard old canvas"
Bob Ross,"This is a double prime pre-stretched canvas and Im using an 18 by 24, but you use whatever size is convenient. And Ive just covered the entire canvas in a little bit of liquid white. Thats all"
Bob Ross,"Just liquid white. And with that, lets have some fun. Im going to start with prussian blue. Old two inch brush. Prussian blue is a very strong blue. I like prussian blue. Okay lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,We start up here in the corner and we just make little Xs or little crisscross strokes. Something about like that. And this will not be an exact duplicate of what you see at the beginning of the show
Bob Ross,"But itll give you an idea of how it was made. There we are. Because we have no patterns, we use no tracings, no drawings. So nothing ever comes out exactly the same"
Bob Ross,"But, as I say once again, itll show you how it was made, and when you create your own, you can add anything or subtract anything from it that you want. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Well just bring it on down about like that. Wherever you want. Okay, I will go right into some midnight black. I want to darken these corners"
Bob Ross,"Im darkening this because this little painting has a lot of clouds in it and I want them to stand out. So the way to make them look brighter, is to make the sky darker. Makes sense doesnt it"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Okay, and down here we can just wipe off the brush, because it wont hurt anything. Alright, I guess thats pretty clean"
Bob Ross,"Now then, I have several of these old brushes going, so I spend all my time washing brushes. Lets go into some titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Just tap the brush or wipe it, it doesnt matter, just get some paint onto here. And lets go up in here, and lets just take it, and begin tapping this. Just tap it. Like so"
Bob Ross,"Let me get a little more color on the brush. There, and all were looking for here is very basic shapes. Were not looking for any detail at all. Just let that blend right on out"
Bob Ross,"Something about like that. There, a little more of the titanium white. Another little cloud right here, and you put as many clouds in your world as you want. As many as you want, or as few"
Bob Ross,"Maybe you dont want any clouds in your world. Its up to you. Up to you, totally and completely. Thats what I like about painting, it gives you freedom. You can experience any world that you want"
Bob Ross,"You can put any dream here that you can conceive. Alright, something about like that. But all were doing is just putting in some basic little shapes. We really dont care"
Bob Ross,"Were going to take the blender brush here in a minute here and just blend these out, because the canvas is wet up here. You can literally move color. You can make it slide right on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"We have a sky full of clouds here. Maybe, yeah why not right there. Something about like that. Let that blend right on out to nothing. Wherever, wherever. Alright, lets get our little blender brush"
Bob Ross,"These little blender brushes are very, very soft. As my father used to say, theyre as tender as a mothers love. There we are. There, and in my case that was certainly true"
Bob Ross,"Im very prejudice but I think I had the greatest mother there was. Beautiful, beautiful lady, and I hope shes watching now. There, see how you fluff that up with that little blender"
Bob Ross,"It just goes right over. Right over. There. Okay, and once again, in your world, you decide how many clouds live in it. Or how few"
Bob Ross,"And thats basically all there is to making a lot of clouds very quickly. Okay, well wash the old blender brush off, and I wash it the same way, little paint thinner in there"
Bob Ross,"Its not as much fun to beat that one though. Didnt make near the mess. With a little blender, I normally wipe it on a paper towel or a clean rag afterwards. Because you want it as dry as possible"
Bob Ross,"Im going to take some black, some prussian blue, little brown, little lizard crimson, whatever. Maybe a little more of that crimson. I like crimson. Its one of my favorite colors"
Bob Ross,"Alright, pull it out as flat as you can get it, cut across, get a little roll of paint down there. You see it. Right on the edge of the knife"
Bob Ross,"And we had a mountain in our world and it lived right here. All were looking for initially, is the shape of the top here. Thats really all were looking for"
Bob Ross,"We could care less whats happening elsewhere. We will later, but right now thats all were looking for. Right there. Just this nice outside edge up here. Thats all, thats all. Very little paint"
Bob Ross,"All were doing is staining the canvas. There, it does not take a lot of paint. Put a little bump right there. So just make a decision and drop it in. In your world, you have total and absolute power"
Bob Ross,Scrape it hard. You can probably hear that. Get in there and pull that paint off. You cannot get it all off. Dont worry about it
Bob Ross,"The only way you can get the canvas back to where you can paint another color is to wash it with paint thinner, just rinse it off. Which is okay, I do that frequently"
Bob Ross,"If I dont care for a painting, I just wipe it off and take a little paint thinner and wipe down the canvas, let it dry"
Bob Ross,"Now therell be a stain on there still, but when you put your liquid white, black, clear, whatever on it, its okay. You paint right over it"
Bob Ross,Give it a few minutes to dry though after you take the paint thinner and wipe it down. Alright. Something about like that
Bob Ross,You know one of the questions I hear over and over in the letters that we get from fantastic people from all over the country is Can I use acrylics to do this. I wish you could
Bob Ross,"Acrylics, theyre a fantastic medium, but they just dry too rapidly. This is a wet on wet technique. So we depend on it staying wet through the entire painting"
Bob Ross,"If it doesnt, then weve defeated our purpose. Sorry to jump around like that. Just jump all over the canvas. There. Maybe a hair there. Just blend up a. Put a little titanium white on there"
Bob Ross,I want to create a misty effect down here at the base
Bob Ross,"And, make that a little lighter, and then we can go back, tap a little bit of that mountain color in, and put the indication of some little things that are far away back in here, just by tapping"
Bob Ross,"Just tapping. These are going to be the ones in the background when were done, if everything works just right. There. I touched a little touch of cadmium yellow"
Bob Ross,"Very, very small amount, and it will give an instant green. It looks like little green things that are growing up the side of the that mountain far, far away. Way, way back here"
Bob Ross,"We dont even know how far back it is. Dont know that we even care. Many, many, many, miles. Alright, over here now, we can pull this one down. Just grab it and pull it"
Bob Ross,"Pull it, let it come right into that, there we go. And all Im doing here is blending out the paint. I want to remove as much paint as possible, so the next layer will stick easier"
Bob Ross,"See its mixing with the liquid white. Then automatically, this beautiful mist will happen. You dont even have to think about it. It happens. There we go"
Bob Ross,See you spend all your thinking time thinking about your painting. There. Alright. Lets take titanium white. Pull it out as flat as you can get it. So you just pull it out
Bob Ross,"Take the knife, go straight down on it. Cut across, get a little roll of paint. And in our world, now no pressure, no pressure, just let this knife just bounce and play. Right down through there"
Bob Ross,"I think, lets have the light coming in from the right on this one. If youre right handed thats normally easier. Just think were light with strike and play here. And let it go"
Bob Ross,"Dont just try to copy. In your mind, decide where all these little highlights live in your mountains because your mountains may be different than mine. Theyre probably much better"
Bob Ross,"Just, there comes a little light, just let it play. We have a little ridge right there. See, thats all there is to it. Mountains, to me, are one of the most fun and enjoyable things to paint"
Bob Ross,"I love them. I love mountains. I think I mentioned many times before, I lived in Alaska for a long time. And Alaska has some of the most gorgeous mountains that God has ever made"
Bob Ross,I think you could find enough material to paint there to last a lifetime
Bob Ross,"Alright, and if you dont have the good fortune of living in an area where theres all these beautiful, beautiful mountains, you can go to the library anywhere and pick up books that show pictures"
Bob Ross,"Art books have pictures in them, So many, many ways you can find photographs or drawings of mountains that allow you to paint some if you want to. Maybe you want to do this without a mountain in it"
Bob Ross,"And thats okay too. Okay, a little bit of this blue color, and well go right back up in here. And just begin adding in some shadows"
Bob Ross,"Once again, this will not be an exact duplicate of what was on TV at the beginning of the show, but it will certainly show you how it was made. There, see there"
Bob Ross,"All those things that happened there just by changing my angles. Im going to grab the small knife. It gets into these little places much better sometimes. There. Very gently, no pressure, no pressure"
Bob Ross,"I cant say that enough times. Alright, I get letters everyday that say Im having trouble making the paint break, or leave all these little holes"
Bob Ross,"One of two things are happening, youre using a paint thats soft, and it wont work, or chances are youre applying too much pressure"
Bob Ross,"But I used to have students do when I was teaching everyday, Id have them practice on their palette, until they can, every time, pull that paint across there, and make it break"
Bob Ross,"And the palettes made of plexiglass. So if you can make it break on plexiglass, shoot, when you get to canvas thats easy. Im just tapping the bottom here. I want to blend this out a little bit"
Bob Ross,"There. Following the angles. Always following those angles. Now sometimes we come from a camera that gives you sort of a funny angle. So if that happens, dont think your painting should look like it"
Bob Ross,"Were coming from a different angle. Okay. Thats a question I hear frequently is, I see you look to the side, what are you looking at over there. I have a television monitor thats right off camera"
Bob Ross,So I can see exactly what youre seeing. And we have some of the most fantastic camera people in the business here
Bob Ross,"And theyll look at what Im looking at, and between us, well turn everything so you can see it the best, and get the best results at home. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Take a little of that, a little indian yellow, yellow ochre, and some of that bluish color I had on the brush, and that immediately would make a nice green"
Bob Ross,"And we just sort of vary back and forth here, some of these colors. Something about like that. And then lift it upward. Make it look like little trees that live far back here"
Bob Ross,"Little tiny trees, little baby trees, but theyre really big, but they just live far away. Far, far away. There we are. Alright"
Bob Ross,"I think I mentioned this in some of the previous shows, that the program is now playing in Japan. And recently we sent a whole bunch of paintings"
Bob Ross,"Original Bob Ross paintings over and they did a big exhibit and hundreds and hundreds of people came to see the paintings. Its fantastic. Fantastic. There, little bit right in there. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Time to have some fun. Lets take, well take some prussian blue, some black, some crimson, and well put some sap green in there too. There we go. I mix up quite a bit of color, like that"
Bob Ross,"Im going to clean the old knife. Lets make the little trees that were in the background. For that, I got your fan brush, so I can just clean. Lets go right into this very dark color"
Bob Ross,"This color should look black on your palette. But because of the prussian blue, it will be predominantly blue. Lets go up in here. And well have some little trees laid right in here"
Bob Ross,"All were doing is just touching and tapping downward. Thats all. Thats all. Very, very simple. Dont make it complicated"
Bob Ross,"When they start breaking apart like that, it means its time to reload the brush. There. Alright. Maybe they come right in there. Wherever"
Bob Ross,"And really the only thing youre concerned about is these nice tops. Whats happening in here, you could care less at this point. Maybe later it will become important"
Bob Ross,"But at this point, we dont even care. Maybe well have these a little higher and drop down. Now sometimes people say mine look like fence posts. See, like that. They look like fence posts"
Bob Ross,"The only thing thats wrong is you dont have enough. Just go back and fill them up. Because as you know, we dont make mistakes. In our world, we only have happy accidents"
Bob Ross,"And very quickly, very quickly, you learn to work with anything that happens on this canvas. Anything. And it takes the fear out of painting. You dont worry about it"
Bob Ross,"Because for so long weve been taught that, you had to be blessed by Michelangelo at birth, or you couldnt paint. Now you may not be able to paint like he did, but you can sure paint this way"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Because this works. And we got trees all the way across. Sometimes its fun to take a little white, and youll make it look like little tree trunks right here"
Bob Ross,"Just take a little white, and very gently, grab that and lift upward, just a little. Dont overdo, dont overdo. Dont overdo it. Looks like little tree trunks far back in the distance"
Bob Ross,"You can take the knife and also cut through it. And itll give an effect as very nice. Okay, time to have more fun. Lets go to that dark color. This is predominantly black. And lets have, maybe"
Bob Ross,Well have some big rocks right there. Predominantly black though. There are some big rocks. All were doing is filling in paint. And we could really do this with a paint roller
Bob Ross,"It doesnt matter how you put this on. Just want to cover the canvas. In fact, if I had thought a little bit, we couldve done the bottom with black Gesso, And this wouldve already been done"
Bob Ross,"Or you couldve used liquid black. The difference between liquid black and black Gesso, liquid black is an oil-based medium. Its designed to stay wet for several days on a good canvas"
Bob Ross,Black Gesso is an acrylic-based. Its designed to dry very rapidly. Its for when you want to work on a dry surface. Liquid black is when you want to work on a wet surface
Bob Ross,"So it just depends on your mood. There, both mediums have their own characteristics and theyre both neat. There we are. Something about like that. All were doing is just covering it up"
Bob Ross,"Now then, going to make a little black, a little white, mix them a gray color. Well theres a little touch of blue in there too. Okay, black, white, little touch of blue then"
Bob Ross,"Whatever happens, pull it out like so, but its marbled, we havent overmixed it. Little roll of paint on the knife"
Bob Ross,"And lets go right up in here and begin just putting indications of all these little rocks and stones. Just let the knife touch and sort of bounce along there, dont overdo. Dont overdo"
Bob Ross,"Just let it bounce. Let it bounce and play. Change the angle so some of them look different. This is far away, we dont know what it is. About like that"
Bob Ross,And I want it to get darker and darker down here towards the base. So it gives the impression that more lights hitting the top than down here at the bottom. Thats all there is to it
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets build us a tree, or two, or three. For that I think Ill use a little oval brush. Its easy to distinguish, it has a black handle. Rest of them all have white handles. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Touch, make a little line, and we start just like we do with a fan brush and using just the corner, just the corner, And on this brush, once we get down, we go straight in, and it makes those"
Bob Ross,"gorgeous, gorgeous hanging downs that you see on evergreen trees. In some parts of the country, the limbs hang down really low, they really hang down"
Bob Ross,"In other parts of the country, They stick straighter out, so it just depends on. I think on where the tree lives. Maybe it has to do with water, I dont know. Sunlight. Dont know"
Bob Ross,"There we go, got a little tree there. Go right into some yellow"
Bob Ross,"Just take the same old brush, go into yellow ochre, cad yellow, to make a green, and very lightly, we said our highlight was coming from the right side. And well add a little liquid white"
Bob Ross,"Make it a little thinner. Our highlights are coming from the right, lights coming from the right, so thats where we want to put the most emphasis on"
Bob Ross,"There and then itll get darker and darker down toward the bottom, until it just disappears. There we go, something about like that. Darker and darker toward the base"
Bob Ross,"Thats important, its most important. Alright, we had a little house in there. Little house lived right here. So all you do is touch and begin scraping out a basic shape"
Bob Ross,Our little house looked something like that. Scrape off all that excess color. Just get in there and scrape it off
Bob Ross,"Well use a little bit of the van dyke brown, dark sienna mixed together Lets just fill it in. Just fill it in. Little like a lean to on the side of this house. There"
Bob Ross,"Van dyke brown, dark sienna mixed together. All there is to it. See, just all were doing is blocking it in at this point. Now well take the brown and put some bright red in it"
Bob Ross,"Little white, little white. And with that, we come back up here. and well just put in a little roof. There, wouldnt this be a gorgeous, gorgeous place to live"
Bob Ross,"Look out over all these beautiful moons and trees. Mm, Id like to have this cabin. Take a little lighter color and just highlight it a little so this edge stands out. Just a little like that"
Bob Ross,"And we go back to our brown and whites, and lets put in a touch, touch of little highlights right there. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Over here on the side, Im going to add a little bit of that prussian blue. I want it to look more like its in shadow. There, maybe even a little darker than that. Oh yeah, thats much better"
Bob Ross,"I want that to be dark. Little van dyke brown, and just touch and make it look like old boards. Slabs, whatever you want to call them. And we need a door in our cabin"
Bob Ross,"This little guy had to have a way to get in there. Shoot. Cut across, add a little bit of light color just to outline the door a little. Wipe off the old knife here"
Bob Ross,"You know what, let me go back to an old two inch brush. Dip it into a little bit of liquid white. Go into a bit of my yellows"
Bob Ross,"We had a little grass around the bottom of this cabin, so we use all the colors here, the yellows, a little touch of red once in a while. Here it comes"
Bob Ross,"But this paint has to be quite thin, because we have to much paint already on the canvas. Each layer of paint needs to get thinner and thinner. There we go. Just tapping. We need a path"
Bob Ross,"Got to have a path. No way to get up in here. Take a little bit of that brown color, eh, I want it brighter now. I cant make that out. Little dark sienna in there and a little bright red"
Bob Ross,"There, he may come home a little impaired, and he needs a path he can see when he comes in here. Can never tell, that happens sometimes. Little sap green"
Bob Ross,"Here we go, now you begin deciding where everything lives in here. About like that. Want to make this look like a little hill here. Shoot, maybe it comes all the way up in here"
Bob Ross,"Something about like that. Wherever, in your world, you decide. You decide. Little black, little white"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little indication here of a little stone and a rock that lives there, and thats basically how we did that little painting. Scratch in a stick and a twig. Shoot you finished"
Bob Ross,"Hope you enjoyed this one, as I said itll show you how the little opening was made. So from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless my friend. light upbeat music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, certainly glad you could join us today. i thought today wed just do a little winter scene, just very simple. Itll make you feel good"
Bob Ross,Lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. Theyll come across right about there
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, come on up here, let me show you what Ive got done. Today I have my standard old pre-stretched, double primed canvas. Say that with a mouthful of rocks"
Bob Ross,"And Ive just covered the entire canvas with a very, very thin coat of liquid white. So the canvas is wet and its slick and its ready to go, so as I say lets just have some fun today"
Bob Ross,"Lets do a winter scene thats got a little color in it. Sometimes winter scenes can become too cold. So Im going to take a little bit of the cadmium yellow, a very, very small amount"
Bob Ross,"I just want a little tiny bit of color in this. Lets go up here. Now, up in here, lets just start, and this probably wont even show now. It will as we progress in the painting I believe though"
Bob Ross,"A little bit of yellow, right along in there. Just making little Xs, or criss-cross strokes. Whatever you want to call them. A little bit more of that, I like that"
Bob Ross,"There, I just want a little glow in the sky so its not, its not a totally dead winter scene. Alright, thats really enough, and as I say it probably doesnt show up much yet. It will, it will"
Bob Ross,"Im going to take some white, and some midnight black. Im going to make a gray color. There, dark gray. Okay, let me wipe the old knife off here. We just wipe the knife on a paper towel"
Bob Ross,"Ill just use that same old brush, thats fine. Go into a little bit of that color, just tap a little color into the bristles. All right, let go right up in here. Then we can just begin"
Bob Ross,"Winter has a lot of gray skies, so thats what I want to make today. Just making little Xs, little criss-cross strokes. Like so. Just put in a little bit of color"
Bob Ross,"There, see thats all there is to it. Start at the top, and work downward"
Bob Ross,"That way your paint is continually mixing with the liquid white thats on the canvas and automatically, automatically your sky will get lighter, and lighter toward the horizon"
Bob Ross,"And in a landscape, thats exactly what youre looking for. All right, something about like so. I dont want to lose all my little yellowish color there"
Bob Ross,"I wont have a glow in my sky, and I want a glow there. All right, let me grab another brush, I have several of them going here. Make sure its dry, and then Im going to blend this"
Bob Ross,"Start in the light area and blend toward the dark area. Now when youre at home you can take your time and really, really blend this out, so its just as smooth as silk. There, alright"
Bob Ross,"And then well just go across the entire canvas to remove the brush strokes. Okay, Im going back to my brush that had all that nice, gray color on it"
Bob Ross,"And lets take, and once again, all Im doing is just tapping the bristles right into a little bit of color. Just tap, see you can see one corner is hitting, but the back is really not hitting,"
Bob Ross,"Its just the front corner Im using. Lets go up in here. And maybe in our world there lives, does now, does now, that easy. Just a happy little cloud that floats around the sky here all day"
Bob Ross,"And Im just using that corner that you watched us load, just using that corner and doing tiny little circles with it. The back of the brush is not touching the canvas. Its just that corner"
Bob Ross,"Something about like so. Like that, just making little circles"
Bob Ross,"Okay, going back to my brush thats sort of clean, and then very gently, very gently Im going to blend the base of that out, so it just disappears, just dissolves right into that sky. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Once again because the liquid white is on there, this works very simply. Im going to lift it, fluff it. You could use youre little blender brush to do that if you wanted to"
Bob Ross,"There, something about like that. Speaking of the little blender brush, you can take it, Im going to tap the corner of it, same way as we did the other, into a small amount of titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Just a little. And this brush is so soft, you can go right back over, and maybe theres a little light that zings right through there. Just blend it right in"
Bob Ross,"Right in, have a little light spot up in there. There, we can reinforce our cloud a little, and were in business, that easy. That easy. I love to paint skies, theyre a lot of fun. Lot of fun"
Bob Ross,"Okay, same old brush. It has the gray color on it. Im going to take it now and go into some titanium white, I want to lighten the color. And pull the brush, wiggle it"
Bob Ross,"Wiggle it as you pull it, that pulls the paint towards the end of the bristles. It make the brush very sharp. See there. Good"
Bob Ross,"Now with that, lets go up in here and lets make the indication of some little distant trees. They live far back in the distance. were just using the side of the brush, and bending it sidewards"
Bob Ross,"This is a super way of making little trees that are far away, far away. I dont want a lot of detail in these. As trees get closer to us, then well put more detail in"
Bob Ross,"right now, were just looking for indications of little trees. There, isnt that an easy, easy way of making them. You can do this, you can do this. Give them a little friend right there"
Bob Ross,"Something about like that. we just put a few little doers in there. And well come back, well come back and blend them out some. Okay. Watch. Clean dry brush. And get mean with it here"
Bob Ross,"This is where you get tough and take out all of your frustrations and hostilities, just get in there and really tap it. Just tap it"
Bob Ross,"We want to create the illusion of mist down at the base of these, Lift upward, it takes out all of the little tap marks. Shoot, we got it, that easy. Im going back to that brush"
Bob Ross,"Now Im going into that same color, its just grey. And well put the least little touch of Prussian blue into it. Least little touch, least little touch. Not much, I want it to be gray"
Bob Ross,"Just want to change the flavor a little bit. Now then, maybe were getting into some trees that are closest to us"
Bob Ross,"So we touch, and this time Im going to give it a little upward push, so it looks like the bristles on the tree. I mean the limbs on the tree. The bristles are on the brush"
Bob Ross,"Looks like the limbs on the tree are sort of going upward. Look at that, isnt that the easiest way to make a tree youve ever seen. Shoot, trees arent difficult. There, just put them in"
Bob Ross,"Decide where they live in your world and drop them in. Now we have two trees. This is mostly black, a touch of prussian blue, a little white, but mostly, mostly black and white"
Bob Ross,"Once again, Im pushing sort of upward. I want these limbs to sort of go upward on the tree. And you decide, in your world, how many there are. You decide. There see, here comes another one"
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes, sometimes you get a little crazy. Of course if youre an artist, thats expected. You can even, you can take the big brush here"
Bob Ross,"Look there, theres a tree, maybe he got a little more sunlight, hes a little stronger. Got a little more detail to him. About like that. And well go back"
Bob Ross,"Im just getting a clean, two inch brush, and all Im, when I beat it on easel like that, the only thing Im doing is removing any excess paint that s accumulated on it"
Bob Ross,"And now Im, once again, beating it very hard. Really getting in there and tapping it. There. Now these, these planes create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting, Theyre very valuable"
Bob Ross,"Theyre your best friend. Take care of them, take care of them. Now Im going a bit into the black some more, Im just, same color Im just making it darker"
Bob Ross,"I might even put a little Van Dyke Brown in there too. I want it to get much darker now. Alright, lets have one more row of trees that covers up this side, and it starts right in there"
Bob Ross,See bust sort of pushing upward at the same time going sidewards and upwards at the same time. There. And you put as many as you want
Bob Ross,"Once again, you create your own world here, any way that you want it. You do it. I tell you what, get brave, heres a big one. Push, Im really pushing hard toward the bottom"
Bob Ross,As you run our of paint you push harder and harder. Get it all out. Thats the beauty of using these big brushes. There we go. There and just a few more little things here and there
Bob Ross,"Wherever you want them. There. Okay, theres one. Something about like that. Alright. You have to decide where theses go. Sometimes when you have this much power, you have to make these big decisions"
Bob Ross,"Thats the price you pay for power, you have to make decisions. And thats what were doing right here. Were making decisions where our world is. And where it goes. There. Alright"
Bob Ross,But the nice thing about it here is you can change your decisions. You can change them at anytime. It doesnt matter
Bob Ross,"You could also put these in, these basic shaped in with a fan brush, if you so desired. it works too. Sometimes I do them with a fan brush, sometimes a two inch brush, just whatever"
Bob Ross,"Find what works for you and do it, use it. Use it. The biggest thing here is that each layer becomes a little darker. And that way it creates that illusion of depth, and distance. Yeah, there"
Bob Ross,"Boy we have a whole forest here. I didnt know we were going to paint a forest, but thats okay. It gives you a lot of practice. You learn by repetition. Doing it over and over and over"
Bob Ross,"In some circles they call that practice. And if theres any secret to this technique or any technique its practice. Thats all, just practice"
Bob Ross,"Its like tying your shoe when you first started it was quite difficult. You had to look, and take your time and really work at it, and now you probably do it without even looking"
Bob Ross,I told that to a lady one time and she looked down and she said Why are you wearing loafers then.. So anyway. Some of us learn better than others. Now I want to tap the base here. Tap it firmly
Bob Ross,"Firmly, I want to create a lot of mist. A lot of mist. Really get in here and take out all of your frustrations and hostilities"
Bob Ross,"There, this is better than arguing with your spouse or picking on the dog or whatever. There we go. Something like that. Then lift upward gently, gently"
Bob Ross,"After we do all that hard tapping, now you got to lift up gently. But that will make mist that looks like its so soft and everything is just floating in there. Time to wash your brush"
Bob Ross,"I really just wanted to get even with the camera people, theyve been hassling me. Now then. In this painting, lets have some snow. Theres many ways to make snow"
Bob Ross,The easiest way is just to load the brush and pull it. But sometimes you want to make snow that looks like powder. I think we did that in another painting in this series. Well do it one more time
Bob Ross,"Just tap. Then well go up here and just like were putting grass in a summer scene, just tap in. Just tap it"
Bob Ross,"Just pretend your making a little hill of grass back here, only its not green, its white. Because green snow is bad, it really bothers people when they look at your painting. There, okay"
Bob Ross,"now, lets take our little blender, thats just as tender as it can be, and very gently, very gently, just go over that, and it makes it look like snow thats just powdery. I hope thats a word"
Bob Ross,"Now then, I tell you what, Im going to take the least little touch of the blue there, on the blender and add a little bit of blue, right down in here. A little Prussian blue. A little Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,"That will be our shadows in snow thats closer to us. Just blue. There, something like that. Wherever you want it"
Bob Ross,"Alright, now that we have a shadow in there, maybe theres another little layer of snow. This is what creates the lay of the land in your painting, Let it go right down into that nice shadow"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, maybe it comes, i dont know, make a decision here, maybe it comes around like that. It would be very simple to turn this into water, if you wanted a little pond in your painting"
Bob Ross,Be very simple. All youd need to do is put a little reflection under it and pull it down. But I dont think well do that today. See now you have all these different layers
Bob Ross,"I tell you what, lets do, yep, right here, right there, thats a good spot. Lets put us in, lets put a little house in here. Wouldnt this be a gorgeous place to have a little house"
Bob Ross,"There, come right on out here. All Im doing is scraping out a very basic little design. Just so I have an idea, Lets go into the Van Dyke Brown, dark Sienna mixed together"
Bob Ross,"Put a little crimson in there too. Now then, the side. There he is, see. Im putting the dark in first because Im going to have snow on his roof. So just decide basically where the roof line is"
Bob Ross,"This is both browns with a little crimson in it. Not much, just a little crimson. Just want to warm the brown up even more. There, I dont want this painting to be too cold"
Bob Ross,"You have to put your coat on to look at it. Something like that. All were looking for is a very basic little shape. Alright. i tell you what, lets get crazy"
Bob Ross,"Lets make, lets turn our little house into a log cabin. You want to do that. Okay, well put some little doers across this way for the top"
Bob Ross,"There, I lived in Alaska for a long time and theres some of the most gorgeous log cabins Ive ever seen in my life. You wouldnt think they were log cabins, they look like castles made out of logs"
Bob Ross,"Whew, beautiful. In Anchorage theres a couple that you have to see to believe. Now here, were going to have logs going the other way. And all well do is first put in a little light area"
Bob Ross,"Dont worry about it. There, see. Pay attention to the angle, thats probably the most important thing. because were looking at whats called a three-quarter view of the cabin"
Bob Ross,"We see both the front, and the side. So you have to play with angles, theyre important here. There"
Bob Ross,"Now on the other side, maybe theres not as much light, so Ill add some brown to it, and well put the indication of a few little things over here too. There, something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Thats all we need. That will give us what were looking for. Maybe, I tell you what, lets get crazy. Let me get the small knife, that ones too big. Maybe, well have a window"
Bob Ross,"I always do cabins, nearly in my paintings where theres nobody home. So lets put the indication maybe somebodys home"
Bob Ross,"Take a little of that yellow, Cad yellow, a little white, and well just put some light in the window here. Of course, maybe the lights are on, and nobodys home. There"
Bob Ross,Ive been accused of having that disease myself. But thats okay. Artists are expected to be a little bit different. And I take full advantage of it. There
Bob Ross,"Alright, well just put some little window panes in there. That easy, that easy. We need a roof, because right now, right now, this little fellows probably getting cold"
Bob Ross,"Now, one of the easiest ways here is to sort of outline it, see. And then you come down, just come right on down. Once again though, angles are very important. Very important. There. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Alright, I think were in business there. now we need a little snow on the other side to show that its deep. Its very deep"
Bob Ross,"Now you can make it very smooth, I like to leave it rough sometimes, because snow begins to decay on you. There, I tell you what, you want to get crazy. Lets do it"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe this little carpenter that built this was industrious and maybe he put a porch on it. So we pull out a little of that color just to get rid of that brown"
Bob Ross,"Then well come back in here, a little white, got to put a little snow out here on the porch too. If its snowing on the roof, its snowing on the porch. Something like that"
Bob Ross,"Here, let me just wipe the knife off. Take a little brown, and put about the same, basic thing out here. We need a little place to set the rocking chair"
Bob Ross,"Alright, lets put, Just a few little posts to hold the roof up. Something like that. Take a little color, and just come along the edge here and just sort of clean the edge up. Bring it all together"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, we do a cabin-ectomy here to get all of our angles right, and were coming along pretty good. Lets go back to our snow brush. Put a little snow that lives right in here. Right along in here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe it comes right on out, I dont know. Wherever you want it. Then back to our little blender brush, and very lightly, barely, barely touching. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, thats almost too good, I have to do it. I have to do it. This is just the perfect place to have a little path"
Bob Ross,"Take a little white, let is just wander back, a little road maybe goes right on back up in here. Something about like that. It just meanders up the way there, as they say. There"
Bob Ross,"A little darker color in here where the ruts are. Shoot, maybe this comes all the way up, I dont know. Then take a little more white and make that snow bank a little more distinct right there"
Bob Ross,"So now we have just a little indication of a little road that goes up in there. Our little blender brush, bring it all together. Alright, now then. Let me find the old knife"
Bob Ross,"One more thing Ill put in here. Take a little bit of brown. Maybe in our world there lives, maybe theres what remains of an old fence right here, Something about like that"
Bob Ross,And we need a rail that goes across the old fence. And here comes another one
Bob Ross,"About like that, and we can take a, let me wipe the knife, we can take a little bit of white, and just go right above it so it looks like theres some snow laying on the fence too. There, see there"
Bob Ross,"There it is, there it is. You can do that. Maybe a little snow on top of that post too. Alright. Let me get a little liner brush"
Bob Ross,"There, usually at the bottom of a fence post, theres little weeds, and sticks and stuff that grow in here. Because you cant cut too close to the fence"
Bob Ross,"So you get these little things, maybe theres all kinds of little doers here. Alright. You know me, I like, I like trees. Take that same color"
Bob Ross,"There, if you have trouble making it come off of your brush, all you need to do is add just a little bit more paint thinner. Because a thin paint will slide right over the top of a thick paint"
Bob Ross,"Its that easy. There, something about like that. Just decide where they live, drop them in. In your world you can put them anywhere that you want them. Its totally, and completely up to you"
Bob Ross,"And you can add all kinds of little branches, or maybe that old tree is dead and theres not many left on it. But youve got to have a few things here for the little birds to sit on"
Bob Ross,"In the winter time, they need a place to sit. Of course they do in the summer time too, but here they can sit and watch you here, and wait for you to bring them out some bird seed or something to eat"
Bob Ross,"I raise a lot of little birds every year and turn them loose, and so I have a special place in my heart for little birds. There"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes you can take a little of the liquid white if you want to make it look like icicles hanging off and just pull a little, just here and there. A few little icicles"
Bob Ross,You can even highlight one side of these posts so they show up a little better. There. Okay. When you do yours you take your time and you fix all these little details. There. Alright
Bob Ross,"if you want to make the road look a little deeper, take a little bit of that, I mean the bank here on the road look a little deeper, take a little of that gray color, and just sort of outline it a"
Bob Ross,"little, and then blend it right in. There, see. And it gives depth to that side of the road. There, like that. And shoot, with that were about to the point where we have a finished painting"
Bob Ross,"Let that come right on up. Im going to take a little bit of red, and sign this one. I think were going to call it done. I hope youve enjoyed this little winter scene. Its very simple"
Bob Ross,"Youll have a lot of fun doing it, and if you have time, after you do it, take a picture of it and send to us. Wed love to see it here"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes, when time permits, we show them on the air, what people just like yourself have done. Until then from all of us here, Id like to Wish you Happy Painting and God bless my friend."
Bob Ross,"soft jazz music - Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad to see you today. I thought maybe today, wed just do a fantastic little seascape. Its very easy and you can do it"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen there that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got done"
Bob Ross,"I thought, today, Id put the little seascape in an oval"
Bob Ross,"We have a piece of contact paper here that I just cut an oval out of, stuck it on the canvas, and I took some black gesso and painted the bottom"
Bob Ross,"The top, I painted with gray gesso, and, as you can see, I didnt do a very good job. It doesnt matter. Just sort of bring them together. Then Ive covered the entire thing with Liquid Clear"
Bob Ross,"On the bottom here, I put a little bit of Thalo Blue and Thalo Green, Thalo Blue and Thalo Green, right across here"
Bob Ross,"Right down here, Ill have a little beach if it comes out right, so I put a little brown, little Van Dyke Brown right there"
Bob Ross,"Van Dyke Brown is not a transparent color, its semi-transparent, but its transparent enough for what were doing here. So lets have some fun today"
Bob Ross,"I want to start out today with a little Indian Yellow, just a very small amount. I use the Indian Yellow because its very transparent"
Bob Ross,"So lets go right up in here, and lets just put a little bit of the Indian Yellow right up here in the sky, something about like that, right over the gray gesso. Well come right down to the water"
Bob Ross,"It doesnt matter if a little bit gets on the water. No big deal, no big deal, we dont care. This is just a fun painting, so youre to enjoy it. About like that, maybe a little Yellow Ochre now"
Bob Ross,Yellow Ochre is not quite as transparent so well put it right in here
Bob Ross,"I thought we can make a painting thats very bright, and very shiny, has a lot of color in it, something that, if you hang it in a room, itll just brighten the room right up"
Bob Ross,"I like paintings like that. There we go. Okay. All were doing here is just basically putting a glaze on the canvas, just a little transparent or semi-transparent color right over the gray gesso"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Ill begin working with opaque colors. Opaque colors, that just means you cant see through them. White is very opaque"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little of that and go right in here, and just begin blending, just begin blending. Thats going to pick up the yellow thats on the canvas and blend right together"
Bob Ross,Were just gonna make a nice little shiny spot there like thats where our lights coming from. Thats exactly what Im looking for
Bob Ross,"You play with opaque and transparent color and you can make all kinds of gorgeous effects. There. About like that. Im gonna take the least, least little touch, least little touch of the bright red"
Bob Ross,"I said least several times because bright red is a very strong color. Be careful with it. Itll eat up your whole world, your whole world, but it is gorgeous"
Bob Ross,"See, the transparency of it allows that gesso to show through, so any little thing that happened there, it comes right out into your world. Its okay, it works, works well"
Bob Ross,"Im just sort of jumping around from place to place here, put in a few little things like that. Im gonna make a little lavender color. I want some lavender"
Bob Ross,"For that, well take some Thalo Blue, Alizarin Crimson. Proportionately, many times more Crimson than Blue. That Blue is strong, Crimson is weak. You cant tell what color that is, it just looks black"
Bob Ross,"So you take a little white and put with some and say, do you like it. No, I dont, so Ill change it"
Bob Ross,"Ill put a little bit more Crimson in it, cause this is our world, and we can change it any way we want it. I like that better"
Bob Ross,"Its a little more to the reddish side, thats what Im looking for cause it sort of goes along with what we have up here. Tell you what Im gonna do. Ill just use a little blender brush"
Bob Ross,"I want a little blue up here, Thalo Blue, just a very small amount, very small amount. Just going to dance that in, right in there. Just a little. There"
Bob Ross,"Add a little white to it, and then itll sparkle, itll jump right out at you"
Bob Ross,"Once again, were working with opaque and transparent color, and it creates some gorgeous effects that I dont know how to achieve any other way. There, see. We have a little touch of blue up there"
Bob Ross,"Be careful that it doesnt hit that yellow and turn bright green, cause thatll happen if youre not careful. We just want enough to give it a little bluish hint. Maybe even a little right in there"
Bob Ross,I dont know. Just a little. Alright
Bob Ross,"Now, going back to that lavender color we made, tap a little into the bristles, and maybe in our world, theres a happy little cloud that floats around, has a good time right here"
Bob Ross,"Just a little cloud, there he comes. Just using the top corner of the two inch brush, top corner only. The other side has no paint on it, see"
Bob Ross,I flip the brush over and I can blend out this cloud with the base of it. Just that easy. There. Maybe theres even a little doer right in there. There we go. You can just put him in like that. There
Bob Ross,Alright. Were gonna have all kinds of beautiful little clouds in here
Bob Ross,"Going back to the little blender brush, this blender brush is so soft, tender, you can go right over all of this without blending it all together. There. See there"
Bob Ross,"Just make a happy little cloud there. Because of the angle of the camera here, it may not look just right until we go back to a camera thats shooting straight on"
Bob Ross,"Sort of doesnt look quite right there. Maybe in our world, lets take a little, I use a little fan brush cause its a little more detailed and I can get in here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put a little, little cloud right over this. Just a happy little cloud. That easy. Back to our little blender brush, and very lightly, very lightly, you can go right in here and blend that"
Bob Ross,"See there. Little cloud just lives there and floats around, has a good time. Okay. I think thats basically all were going to do for that little sky, cause Im gonna spend more time with the water"
Bob Ross,"Alright, as I say, its Thalo Green and Thalo Blue. We just bring it right up to the horizon there. About like that, no big deal, however. Take the little blender and blend right over that"
Bob Ross,"It doesnt matter if it picks up a little touch of it, but it brings that horizon right together. There. Okay, better wash that little blender off"
Bob Ross,"We wash it the same way as we wash the other brushes, except its not near as much fun to beat. Alright, dry it on a paper towel. Maybe in our world, tell you what, Ill move that over there"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna get some Dark Sienna, little bit of the bright red, and some white. Ill just mix those together. I like that, thats a pretty color. Part of it, Im gonna put a lot of white in"
Bob Ross,I want part of it to be lighter than the other. There. Sort of a pinkish. Let me wipe the old knife. Well grab us a fan brush here. Theres one. Get the old fan brush loaded full of color
Bob Ross,"Alright, lets go up in here. Maybe theres a little headland, comes out right here. Take the fan brush and well push upward"
Bob Ross,Im starting right into the lightest area with my lightest color that Ive made right there. Now Im going into the darker part of the same color. Begin letting that get darker and darker. There
Bob Ross,"See there. Darker and darker, both directions. Each time, little darker. Well just sort of work that together. Darker, and darker, and darker is all were looking for. Dark, dark, dark"
Bob Ross,"Down here at the base, almost a solid Van Dyke Brown where it comes to the water. Want that to be very dark. Alright"
Bob Ross,"As I say, this is one of the easiest little seascapes that you can do, and its very effective, very, very effective. There, this will make a beautiful gift for friends and neighbors, whoever"
Bob Ross,"Whats so nice, we know that paintings will be with us long after were gone. Maybe, for some of us, maybe its about as close as we come to immortality"
Bob Ross,"Im going to the liner brush with paint thinner on it, and maybe out here in our world, little darker so it stands out a little more. Sometimes you have to exaggerate color for television purposes"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres just a happy little palm tree that lives out here, several of them. Just make the indication of some little palm trees that live. These are too far away, now, to have much detail"
Bob Ross,"Were just looking for basic little shapes, basic little shapes. We dont even know where theyre at. There. Put some little arms sticking out there on him. There we go. Something like that. See"
Bob Ross,"Just wherever you think they should be. Not gonna spend a lot of time messing with them. Thatll give you an idea of how to make what looks like a bunch of little palm trees far, far away. There"
Bob Ross,"I live in Florida, so we have a lot of palm trees there. There we go. Alright. Oops, didnt get that brush clean. Try again. Now we can get down here to the fun part of this. Lets grab a fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna go right into a very small amount of the Titanium White. We dont need much, just put some on the bristles, and lets begin figuring out where things are at"
Bob Ross,"Lets have a big old crasher wave in here, and our crasher waves gonna live right about there. Itll come over and go right on off the canvas somewhere. To help, theres where its gonna crash"
Bob Ross,Does that help. Like that. That just sort of lays it out so you have an idea of where youre going. Sometimes its hard to take a trip if you dont know where youre going. Were taking a little trip
Bob Ross,"Here, let me exaggerate. Im doing this, only not near that big. Im exaggerating grossly there. So that you have little wave motions happening back there, far away"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, maybe theres another little wave lives right here. Just sort of outline them. It really helps you to see where they live and how you want them to go. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that color gorgeous. That Thalo Blue and Thalo Green. I like that. Its a dynamite color, dynamite. Over on this side, I want to get very dark in comparison. Alright"
Bob Ross,I have several fan brushes going here so I dont have to spend all my time washing them. Im gonna grab one and begin pulling that color back. Im just going back with it. Something like that
Bob Ross,"See there. Were more interested in the dark area, believe it or not, than we are the light area. The dark area here, thats our good friend. See those, how they just begin appearing"
Bob Ross,"Then you come back with a little liner brush and put all the little highlights in there, and thats when it really, really and truly, jumps right out at you. Alright. Something about like so"
Bob Ross,"Back into my paint, Titanium White. This is the fun part. Lets make the wave crash over. Start up here where you think it lives, grab it, and just give it a little pull, a tiny little pull"
Bob Ross,"Load a little bit more color on the brush. You may have to reload the brush several times so this color stays pretty pure. Youre picking up a little of that, but you dont want a whole bunch"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little white, a little Cad Yellow, mix them on the filbert, and right here, this is gonna be the eye of the wave, or the transparency, or, in technical terms, its called the pretty"
Bob Ross,"part.  There. Let me wipe the color off and reload it so its nice and pure, but even that makes a beautiful color against that Thalo Blue and Green, beautiful color"
Bob Ross,"Well just sort of let that wander right on down there, out of the way. Now, we take our little blender brush"
Bob Ross,"Very soft, very gentle, and you can come right in here and just sort of use the corner of it, and begin blending that. You can blend it until its absolutely as smooth as silk. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Just wind it up. Look at that. See it come there. Little blender brush makes it so much easier. You can do it with a two inch brush, though"
Bob Ross,"If you dont have a little blender, you can do it with a two inch, just not quite as smooth, not quite as smooth. Back to my little filbert. Add a little lavender color, crimson and blue"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna use that for the shadow color of the foam here. Chh. Make these little noises, they really help. Think about the waves just coming up here, and turning, and crashing, just having a good time"
Bob Ross,There. Alright. Well come right on up like that. Im gonna put some rocks there
Bob Ross,"Just decided Im gonna put some rocks there so Im not too worried about that area, not too worried about that right now. While we have these old filberts going, bring this right on around"
Bob Ross,We can begin thinking about foam patterns that are just working right on down the side here. These foam patterns are what give shape to your wave
Bob Ross,"I find that holding the brush like this rather than like a pencil, allows you a little more control, but thats an individual thing. You try it and see"
Bob Ross,"You try it and see cause everybody is different, thank goodness, so it makes us all wonderful and special. Would be boring if we were all the same, Ill tell you that"
Bob Ross,"Let me wash that brush and get it nice and clean. Just wipe it on a paper towel, clean it off. Ill take just pure Titanium White"
Bob Ross,"Im using pure white because its gonna mix with all these under colors. Were gonna get all kinds of things. Lets put a little foam right up here, little splashy doers. Chh"
Bob Ross,"Once again, make those little noises. I know people look at you funny, but it puts you in the mood. Makes you feel like youre at the ocean. There. See. There they go"
Bob Ross,"Just crashing and having a good time. Back to our little blender. Once again, you could use two inch brush and itll work. I did for many years before we got the little blenders. It will work"
Bob Ross,"Its not quite as smooth, but youll be delighted with the effect that you get. Youre continually picking up that under color. We said we was gonna have a rock out there, so lets build us a rock"
Bob Ross,"You take Van Dyke Brown, a little Dark Sienna mixed together. Ill put some black in it too. I want a dark rock. In fact, Im gonna use a lot of black. I want it really dark"
Bob Ross,Our rock lives right there. This old filbert brush is great for rocks. Just drop them in. There. We have a whole big old bunch of rocks there now. We dont even know how many rocks
Bob Ross,"Take a little of the bright red, I didnt clean the brush, just leave the dirty color on there, and you can begin picking out and forming all the various rock things"
Bob Ross,"Just let them come right off your brush. Here comes one. See there. As I say, the old filbert brush does some nice things like this. You can literally shape a rock"
Bob Ross,"That would make a good song, Shape A Rock.  There we go. Wherever we want it. Take my liner brush and get some white, put a little of Thalo Blue with it. Thats pretty, I like Thalo Blue"
Bob Ross,"Paint thinner. Here and there and there and here. Lets just put the indication of water thats dripping all down these rocks. When you have unlimited time at home, play with this"
Bob Ross,"Oh, its fun, it is so much fun to do this. I like to do these little simple seascapes. Sometimes seascapes can get to be a son of a gun"
Bob Ross,"What we show you here, though, are very simple, and you can do them, you can do these. We need a little area up in here that looks like beach. Well take a little white"
Bob Ross,"Well just use a two inch brush. Decide, basically, where your beach is gonna be, lets say its right here. Pull straight down, straight down. There we go. There. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"It looks like a little dirt up here, little sea sand. Put a little more white right here. Theres our light source, so well put a little additional white right there"
Bob Ross,"Then, go across and instantly, it looks like very wet sand. Good place to take your shoes off and just let your feet run naked through there. Thats fun. Now, lets decide where a wave comes"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take the small knife, I use the small knife for this, and take a little blue, a little Thalo Blue, and put in my white, but not much, just a little. Basically, it comes right about here"
Bob Ross,"See there. Im pushing very, very hard. You can probably see the knife bending"
Bob Ross,"I guess if you do that over a period of years, you can finally wear the knife out pushing so hard, but it takes a long time. We can just go back in here and put in all kinds of foam patterns"
Bob Ross,There we are. Something about like that. Okay
Bob Ross,"Find my little filbert brush, take a little white, at least a little touch of blue in it, and you can begin working on all these little things, putting in detail. There we are"
Bob Ross,Little touch more of the blue in it. See there how easy that is
Bob Ross,"Sometimes, its fun to take Thalo Blue and Thalo Green like Thalo Blue and a little Thalo Green mixed together, and you can go back in here and punch in holes. I guess thats a good way to call it"
Bob Ross,"Just punch in holes in the surf. Right like that, wherever you think they should live. Alright. Lets find our little liner brush here. There it is"
Bob Ross,"With that, Ill take a little white, paint thinner, touch of the Thalo Blue, just a touch, just want to tone it, and lets go in here and begin putting in all kinds of little things"
Bob Ross,"Once again, when you do yours, take your time, and put in a ton of these. Theyre gorgeous. Its what makes your painting work and look good. Maybe theres even a little bit of water right here"
Bob Ross,"See here. Okay. Then you come right in here. Just begin putting in all your little, these are the little goodies that make your painting work, make it beautiful. There. Begin blending it back"
Bob Ross,"All kinds of little doers. Once again, I know youre tired of hearing this, but these little lines here are what shape your waves, what give form and texture to your waves"
Bob Ross,"Treasure them, theyre your good friend, very good friend. There we are. There. See. Just let them go. Im going to go into a little bit of Cad Yellow and white"
Bob Ross,"Back here, I want to brighten this area where as it comes around like that. There. See, you just have a little sun zinging right through that area. Right on down. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets have some fun here. Lets have some fun. Im gonna take black. Bravery test. Palm tree lives, yep, youre right, right there. Hes got a friend, lives right there"
Bob Ross,"Right through all that, right through all that. We take our knife, then take a little brown and white, and we just put a little edge on this palm tree, just a little edge, just touch it"
Bob Ross,"Thats all you gotta do. Touch, just touch. There. Okay. Fan brush, paint thinner. I want to thin this paint. I dont want to thin it as thin as ink, but I want it much thinner so itll slide easily"
Bob Ross,"Lets come up here, and well put some little doers hanging off this tree here. Just a few little things, there they come. There. Isnt that a simple little way of making a gorgeous little seascape"
Bob Ross,"It really works well. This is one that, if you give to friends, theyll be delighted. Alright. The other tree, hes naked back here. He needs something too. There. Something like so"
Bob Ross,"That gives us a basic little palm tree, very simple one. Ill tell you what. Lets come up here and take the contact paper off and see what we have. This is the moment of truth. Isnt that fantastic"
Bob Ross,"Its a beautiful way to make a very effective little seascape. I hope you try it, and from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. soft jazz music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. You know whats so great about being the host of your own show"
Bob Ross,"You get to bring guests on every once in a while, and today its my privilege as well as my pleasure to present to you one of the finest teachers in the country as well as one of my closest friends"
Bob Ross,Id like to present to you today Mr. Dana Jester. Dana travels all over the country and he teaches literally thousands of people the joy of painting
Bob Ross,"Ive asked him to come today and do a little painting and show you how easy it is. Dana, how about doing just a fine little painting there and Ill see you in a little while"
Bob Ross,"- I think I can handle that. Thanks a lot, Bob. Ill tell you what well do"
Bob Ross,"Well start off by Ill tell you how I have the canvas prepared, and while Im doing that theyll run the colors across the bottom of your screen for you"
Bob Ross,"What I start out with today is an 18 by 24 canvas coated with black jet, so I allowed that to dry, and then I put a nice thin, even coat of liquid clear, and then very, very thin liquid clear"
Bob Ross,"Then next, I went ahead and mixed up a color which was Van Dyke brown and alizarin crimson, probably about 23 Van Dyke brown and 13 alizarin crimson, and coated this portion of the canvas here,"
Bob Ross,"leaving this area open, just black jet over there. With that, well go ahead and get started. Well mix up a color here"
Bob Ross,"Well take some titanium white, go ahead and mix up plenty of this color here, and a little yellow ochre. If you dont like this color, you use the color you want in your painting"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes Im doing a painting and work on it real hard, and decide in the middle of the painting I dont like the color and just change it. See, Im mixing up quite a bit of this"
Bob Ross,"After you get something like that, thats good enough. Wipe off the old paint off the knife and, well grab a 2 brush, and just tap it in the paint like that. No particular way to load"
Bob Ross,"Well go right up here to the canvas. You know what. When I do this, every time I do something like this, this here reminds me of a flame. Ya know, a flame. Not yet, but youll see it here in a second"
Bob Ross,Look at that. Thats a flame on a candle. We can pretend like it anyhow
Bob Ross,Im going to make this a little larger than maybe what I want it to be on the finished painting because that dark will overpower that real quick
Bob Ross,"Well have the same color going here, and well just put us a little light right down through here. What I thought wed paint today is a wooded scene or something that might look nice"
Bob Ross,"Since Im from Indiana, we need a wooded scene. Maybe this here will be a path or something. Who knows. Just go nice horizontal brush stroke back and forth on it"
Bob Ross,A little wider at the bottom for perspective purposes to help you out a little bit. That way itll go back into the painting
Bob Ross,"While we have this same color going, were gonna reload our brush, and well go back right over here on this side here"
Bob Ross,"No particular order, were just gonna indicate some light every now and then that shows through some of those trees. What trees. Well, I dont know. Ill show you here in a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Just Xs, just get real loose with it. Boy, that looks crazy now, doesnt it. While were working on the same color, well just come right up here and put a little bit on this side"
Bob Ross,"Maybe just a little down in here. I know its hard to see on this black canvas, but trust me, theres a little there. What were gonna do is go ahead and clean our brush. This is the fun part"
Bob Ross,"You know what. I tried to get Bob to stay on here, but he just wouldnt do it. Hes afraid I would flip paint on him like I did the last time"
Bob Ross,"Now, with the clean brush, well come up here and well blend and soften this down"
Bob Ross,"What youre really looking for when youre doing this is just, well if you wear glasses, it looks like you need to put your glasses on. Just something like that"
Bob Ross,Now well jump over here to this other side. Blend and soften that down a little bit
Bob Ross,"With the same brush, all Im gonna is come down here and beat the excess paint off of it, brush tinks and then go in with the same brush and pick up titanium white, quite a bit on the brush"
Bob Ross,"Just kind of pull it through there like that, and that makes a nice heavy load on the brush. Then well go up here, splat. Thats gonna be our brightest area in the painting"
Bob Ross,"Continually go back and reload. Theres a lot of paint on this, a lot of paint. Boy, I like this new easel. I tell you what, this is nice"
Bob Ross,"Now well set that down and let that brush rest for a minute and well use this new-looking blender brush here. Well just, real lightly, blend it on this area here. And soften all this down"
Bob Ross,"You dont want any real, real sharp edges there, and over here the same thing"
Bob Ross,"Okay, you can set that down, and we can grab our pallet knife and mix up a little bit of Van Dyke brown, a little Van Dyke brown and a touch of titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Its just a shade lighter than Van Dyke brown, and then well work with the fan brush. All well do is load the fan brush to a chiseled edge. Quite a bit of paint on the bush, just like that"
Bob Ross,"Here we go. Now, come up here and start at the top, and just drop in an old tree trunk. It might be a new, its a new tree trunk, thats right. Thats not an old one"
Bob Ross,"Reload, and there might be an old crooked little old friend right. there. Of course, we have a bunch of trees in here. This is just to indicate the tree trunks themselves. Its a bigger tree over here"
Bob Ross,"At this point of the painting, I always look at this and say, Is this going to make a painting.  You never know, I tell you. But no worry, you can do it. Its not that hard once you try it"
Bob Ross,Now well jump over here on the other side and put in a couple little tree trunks over here. We dont want this side to feel left out. And well put that old brush down
Bob Ross,"Well grab a clean 2 brush, and then well lightly follow the same direction that you put the tree trunks on and blend and soften those down. Thatll set them back into the painting"
Bob Ross,"Then well go over here to this side and do the same thing. Okay, with that, well go ahead and stomp in some dark color here. Were gonna get carried away here"
Bob Ross,"brush taps When Im teaching classes, I call this the 4 oclock stomp. When it gets close to the end of the day, Ill just grab the old brush and say, Lets do the 4 oclock stomp"
Bob Ross,"It may be 230, but it gets them moving, I tell ya. Well go right up here, and well start by tapping in some indications of some trees, or some foliage anyhow"
Bob Ross,"If you want it to get softer, just tap a little more on its outer edge, and itll soften up because its working into your light color there"
Bob Ross,"We dont want to get too carried away, but you need to have a little bit of this foliage on here"
Bob Ross,"In order to see your light, you need the dark, so if you just keep that in mind every time you do one of these"
Bob Ross,"Now when you get down here on these smaller bushes, what you want to do is tap and pull in to your painting like that"
Bob Ross,"Well go up to the other side, the other corner and well tap some more foliage into them trees. I tell you what, sometimes the quicker you do this, the better off you are"
Bob Ross,"If you move along real quick and brush this in there, more than likely youll have a better looking painting. I know it probably doesnt make sense"
Bob Ross,"When you load this brush, just tap like this into your paint, and get that little roll of paint out there on the end just like that. Push it in there like that. Save some of that sky area"
Bob Ross,"Before we get too carried over here toward the center, what we better do is put in some of this mixture here which is a little bit of yellow ochre, the mixture we used earlier in the light area there,"
Bob Ross,"and add a little more yellow ochre to it. So its yellow ochre, white, and lets do one more thing to it, a touch of alizarin. Or two touches if you want to"
Bob Ross,"Take your 2 brush, just tap right into your paint like that. Thats where you get that little ridge of paint out there. Well put some distant bushes in here, or faint little trees"
Bob Ross,"All I do is put a basic tree shape on there and then, get a clean brush and. tap over it and soften them down a little bit more. Thats what well do. Well just grab another clean 2 brush"
Bob Ross,"Have plenty of brushes here, thank goodness, going. Just tap right along this edge, and pull down. The same goes with this over here"
Bob Ross,"Now well go back to our old dirty brown brush, thats to save some time, Well load our brush into the paint just like this again pushing it into your paint like that"
Bob Ross,Then well come up here and put in a big tree here. Thats a monster there. He sneaks right on out here toward the light. Keep reloading your brush
Bob Ross,"You need the dark in order to show your lights, so keep that in mind when youre doing this. Like I say, if you dont like these colors you can always change yours. You dont have to follow this exact"
Bob Ross,"Down over here in this area, we want to turn the brush and use it vertically when I tap onto the canvas just to indicate some different sized bushes there. Go back and reload again, same color"
Bob Ross,"And tap in some more bushes underneath these larger trees. While we have that same color going, well just reload and get some more bushes over here on this other side"
Bob Ross,"That creates by this little mist here, that will create a layered look like theres more depth in your painitng"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well put that brush down and well go back with our fan brush and some Van Dyke brown and some midnight black. Were just looking for a good, dark color, so thats fine"
Bob Ross,"Well just go right up here, and maybe theres a tree trunk that you can see right there, and then it skips along and maybe hits someone right here. Its a hit-and-miss method, thats what it is"
Bob Ross,"I know its probably hard for you to see, but its there. It comes down just like that. And maybe theres one more larger tree sneaking in right here"
Bob Ross,"just kind of let your brush bounce if its hard for it to stick, it will release more paint and it will stay right there on the canvas quicker for you"
Bob Ross,Then well grab a liner brush and go down into our thinner here and thin down some Van Dyke brown. Im picking up quite a bit of thinner because it takes it
Bob Ross,"It takes a lot of thinner to make the liner brush load right. Now after you get this pretty well thinned down, just spin it through the pain like that, roll it"
Bob Ross,"That loads the entire bristle, and then go up here and hold back on the brush and then just lightly let it flip off there. quick whooshing sounds Oops, I forgot you neednt make some sound effects"
Bob Ross,"These old things, I tell you, if you drink about four cups of coffee and then try this youll be in better shape. That way you have a nervous hand there"
Bob Ross,"Zip, and in your world, as you know youve heard before, you can put these branches as many as you want or as few as you want"
Bob Ross,"quick swishing sound I do that in a lot of workshops, like when were teaching the teachers, Ill go making these sound effects, and then they start copying that"
Bob Ross,"It seems like it works a little bit better. Anyhow, something like that. Just throw you a couple little sticks, twigs down there at the bottom right here. Maybe a couple dead ones in there"
Bob Ross,"Ill have to add some more thinner to that. We dont want this side to feel left out, so well put a couple over here"
Bob Ross,"Kind of reminds me sometimes I get carried away with this and it looks like maybe theres a deer antler sticking his head out there. It might be, I dont know"
Bob Ross,"You dont want some of these trees to feel left out like these guys right here. They need a branch or two. Zip, zip, zip. See, if you just kind of flip them on there, youre in a lot better shape"
Bob Ross,"Lets do one more, and then well move onto something else. Over here on this side, put a couple on this guy here. We dont want him to feel left out"
Bob Ross,"Hell feel like hes naked just standing out there in the woods without some branches on him. See, if you just flip them on there and get carried away, sometimes it looks even better"
Bob Ross,"And sometimes it doesnt. Okay, lets clean that liner brush. Lets grab us a clean fan brush and a little bit of the liquid white and some of this dark Van Dyke brown and some liquid white"
Bob Ross,"Well tap us in a couple little highlights on these trees. The light source is coming from here, so well just take and tap right down through here. Now maybe this tree trunk will show up a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Stand out just a little, and just tap it mainly on the left-hand side, and let it just get darker and darker and you go to the other side. Keep going back and reloading your brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets do this old fella standing right here. Now with that, I think we probably better put in a couple of little lighter areas, like maybe the lights really striking down through here on this path"
Bob Ross,"Im just going to pick up with this fan brush some straight titanium white, quite a bit of it on the brush. Load it to a chiseled edge, and swooshing noise"
Bob Ross,"Theres a lot of paint left there on the canvas. Now what Ill do with this fan brush now is just go back and forth on this, just hit and a miss, like that"
Bob Ross,"And maybe just back and forth a little, rocking stroke just like that til is just goes back into nothing. That kind of sets that path off a little bit more"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets take a clean, well lets get us a clean brush here. Okay, well take a clean 2 brush, after I get one clean here. Thats what you get for being lazy and letting them stack up"
Bob Ross,"Im bad about that whenever Im doing a class too. Okay, now with this 2 brush, what well do is well go ahead and tap into our yellow ochre and white mix"
Bob Ross,"Now you see why I made so much of it, andthe I push it into the paint just like that. Well go up here and highlight these little rascals"
Bob Ross,"Just a lot of paint and a little, little light touch continually going back and reloading that brush. You know what"
Bob Ross,"I tell them also, No paint, no painting, so keep going back and reloading that brush. We just, again just like I was saying, we tap and push it into the paint just like that"
Bob Ross,We dont want this side over here to feel left out. Youll just need to continually go back and reload your brush
Bob Ross,"Let it get darker, and darker, and darker as you get further up into the corner of the painting. You know what I would do"
Bob Ross,Is maybe add a touch more alizarin crimson to this and change the flavor a little bit and put in some different colors right here on these guys here. Reload the brush
Bob Ross,"Thats one thing you gotta continually do. Okay lets change the flavor a little bit more, more alizarin. Getting in that yellow ochre mixed again, more alizarin"
Bob Ross,"And well pounce in a couple of them right here. Look at that. Maybe, Ill tell you what, just vary your colors to what you want. This just happens to be what Im going to work with"
Bob Ross,"Now as I work on across the painting, I might want to darken it up. I want to add a little bit of this Van Dyke brown-alizarin mix, so its not quite as bright but still pretty bright"
Bob Ross,Maybe its a little darker over here. But at least you can still see a bush there. Same color. There it is growing down here on the base of these trees
Bob Ross,"And since this is not so bright well use the same, this on the highlight for this tree back here, the foliage, just a little bit. We dont want a whole lot on here"
Bob Ross,"I can see just a little touch of it there. Now, what well do is go ahead and clean that brush, flip out the excess thinner. Its the fun part brush tinks, and then beat it"
Bob Ross,Then what well do is go in that mixture we was just working with. I just want to clean the brush so I can load it and get a better load
Bob Ross,"There you can see where that little roll of paint, that little ridge. That way we can form the land here, the lay of the land"
Bob Ross,"This being your lightest area, its safer to start right in here, and follow this angle, this lay of the land. If not, youll be in trouble"
Bob Ross,"brush sweeps When youre at home you can always, take your time and do whatever to it here. Just chuffing noise. See, those sound effects, that helps a lot"
Bob Ross,"brush sweeps Its also important as youre doing this to save just a little bit of dark there. Go back and reload the brush, and get us another little bit of land sticking out here on this side"
Bob Ross,"Then after you pretty well have it in there like that, theres not much paint left in the brush, so what I would do is go ahead and take this same brush and very lightly tap right underneath here"
Bob Ross,"So you dont have that real dark, straight edge up there. Looks like its attached. Same thing for this other side. Now I want to brighten this area right in here up a little bit more"
Bob Ross,"Im going to load some of our yellow ochre and white, just like that, and brighten it up just a little bit where the light may be hitting it just a little more. Well zap a couple of those in there"
Bob Ross,"That just shows the light hitting on top of those mounds. Then Ill grab a clean fan brush, pick up some Van Dyke brown and midnight black, and put in a couple little rocks"
Bob Ross,ricochet imitation There might be three or four rocks there. You can put as many or as few in your opinion as you want
Bob Ross,"Then, with some titanium white, liquid white, and a little bit of Van Dyke brown, well stick a little bit of highlight on top of those"
Bob Ross,"Ill tell you, the old camera on the wall says its about time to get out of here. So with that, I hope youve enjoyed this painting and until next time, happy painting. bright guitar music"
Bob Ross,"- Hey, certainly glad to see you today. Thought today wed just do a fantastic little painting thats nice and easy. I believe youll enjoy it. So Ill tell you what"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have them run all the color across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got done today"
Bob Ross,I have my standard old canvas up here. Now today Ive just taken and Ive covered the top with liquid white and the bottom with liquid black and blended them together
Bob Ross,"I have very little liquid black on the bottom, but I know I want some dark down here, so whats an easy way to do it. Put the black in and its already there for you. Okay, lets do it"
Bob Ross,"Lets just, lets do a winter scene today. What the heck. Im going to have the least little touch of alizarin crimson in it"
Bob Ross,"I dont want much, just pull out a tiny tiny little bit and lets go up in here. Maybe Ill have a big mountain today and I want a little touch of this crimson right behind the edge of the mountain"
Bob Ross,"Just, just to warm it up a tiny little bit. But be careful. Dont get too much of this. Youll set the old sky on fire. Dont want to do that. Dont want to do that"
Bob Ross,"And I want to keep this painting quite dark. Quite a bit into the gray tones. I think Ill, I think Ill do it that way. All right. Just that much crimson. Thats all we needed. It may not even show"
Bob Ross,"All right, lets go over here and get a little, lets get a little midnight black and prussian blue. Midnight black, prussian blue"
Bob Ross,"Okay, go back up in here, and well just very quickly, using our little criss-cross strokes, little Xs, well just dance in a happy little sky here. Something about like that. Very simple little sky"
Bob Ross,"There. Okay. Now then, right off this time I get to wash the brush, and thats the most fun part of this whole procedure. There we go. Okay, lets wash the old brush"
Bob Ross,"Well just give it a little scrub, shake it off. Like that. laughter And beat the devil out of it. Well go back into the light area with a clean brush and just blend these two areas together"
Bob Ross,"Something about like that. Oh, lifes wonderful, isnt it. There we go. Thats about all we need. I just want some of a blue gray sky in here, but dark enough to give you the feeling of winter"
Bob Ross,"There, all right. Well just knock off the excess paint. Maybe I can use that one again. Lets take prussian blue, midnight black, crimson, maybe a little brown in there too, little van dyke"
Bob Ross,"Blue, black, crimson, a little brown. Pull it out as flat as you can get it. Cut across, get a little roll of paint. Should live right on the end of your knife. And with that, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe our big mountains going to live right here. Lets touch. Where do we want it to go. Lets make a wild mountain today. Shoot, if youve painted with me before, you know I love mountains"
Bob Ross,"Theyre a lot of fun. And theyre easy to do in this technique. Very very easy to do. Mountains, and maybe reflections are the two things that work the best. Or maybe theyre just my favorites"
Bob Ross,"See if somethings your favorite, then you think it works the best. So lets see. Maybe, tell you what, lets get crazy. Put a bump over here too. That will be enough to keep up busy"
Bob Ross,"Scrape off all the excess. Just really get in and scrape it off. See most of that pink went away but theres going to be a little bit that shows in several places, and thats all I was looking for"
Bob Ross,"Just enough to warm it up a little so its not too cold. There. Now with a clean brush, well grab that. And pull it"
Bob Ross,"That removes excess paint and pulls it down so it gets lighter in value toward the horizon, and thats what were looking for. Thats exactly what were looking for"
Bob Ross,"When I said we was going to do a big mountain, I wasnt exaggerating was I. There. About like that. But notice how the base of that, already it looks like its just floating there"
Bob Ross,And that happens automatically when you have the liquid white. Liquid white is continually blending with your color and these little effects just happen. There we go. There we go. All right
Bob Ross,"Lets take titanium white. Pull it out as flat as we can get it. Really get in there and get tough. Cut across, get our little roll of paint once again. See, pull it out, cross, little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"With that, we have to make some big decisions here. Maybe on our world this whole mountain comes right down like that. I dont know. You decide. But no pressure. Absolutely no pressure on the knife"
Bob Ross,Just in your mind pretend that only the paint is touching. The blade of the knife is not even touching the canvas. So nothing is touching except the paint. There. All right
Bob Ross,Today Im having this highlight come from the left side. Its up to you. You may want to change it and put it on the other side. In your world you can put it anywhere that you want it. Anywhere
Bob Ross,"Lets mix up some shadow for that. Well use a little, probably use a little prussian blue and white. Maybe put a little black in to dull it. Dont want it too bright"
Bob Ross,"Hurt your eyes, have to wear sunglasses. There. Maybe a little bit darker. Oh, thats getting right now. Gets good. You know when its right. You can sort of look at it and tell"
Bob Ross,Our little roll of paint. And lets just put in the indication here and there of a few little shadow areas. Just a few little things. There. I like to do these. Theyre so much fun
Bob Ross,"And if anybody can paint mountains in this technique, its probably my son Steve. That son of a gun is the best mountain painter in the country. He makes me look bad sometime"
Bob Ross,"His mountains are so good. So good. But that just means Im proud of him. There. Because hes painted, hes painted since he was about 12 years old"
Bob Ross,"And hes a good example of what can be done, even at a young age. There. Pull it right over in there. Reach up in here. Pull a little bit of that down"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of work these together till theyre like you want them. When I said we was going to do a big mountain, I wasnt kidding was I. Maybe theres a shadow comes across right over here"
Bob Ross,I dont know. Maybe little lights. You make the decisions. You decide where you think lights zinging through here. There. Here it comes. Just barely barely barely touching the canvas
Bob Ross,I cant say that enough. I want that to look rounded. So you just use those kind of strokes. To make it look that way just think what it would look like
Bob Ross,"I want it to look like its coming over the front. Sneaky, huh. Theres one right there. Back to the white. Im just going back and forth between white and the shadow color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a bump that lives out here. Wherever. It doesnt much matter. In your world you can put this anywhere that you want it. There we go. See, just let these things happen"
Bob Ross,"This whole knife will do wonderful wonderful things for you. You can do entire scenes using absolutely nothing but the knife. Little, its a little slower, but the effect is beautiful. It is beautiful"
Bob Ross,"In some of the earlier series, I think we did a couple of those. Our actually painting time here is less than 25 minutes. And there is no editing"
Bob Ross,"If youve paint with me before, you know what you see is what actually happened. We dont edit. These are filmed live time. There we go. So if we make a booboo, its right here"
Bob Ross,"But thats all right, because we dont make mistakes in our world. There. We dont even know where that goes. Dont know that we even care. Pull that a little lower. Now we got us a big mountain here"
Bob Ross,Lets have some fun. Clean dry two inch brush. Follow those angles. I want to creates the illusion of mist down here. If I dont pick up a little titanium white so it increases it even more. There
Bob Ross,"I want it nice and misty cold area down in there. Something about like that. And blend it, take out the tap marks, bring it together. Thats all there is to it. All right"
Bob Ross,"Now we got to decide where were going. Maybe in our world, tell you what. Lets take that mountain color. What was that. Crimson, prussian blue, some black, brown. Thats what we had in it"
Bob Ross,"Just mixing up a pile more of it. Okay. Lets find us a fan brush. Well go right into this very dark color. Very very dark, should look black. Load both sides of the brush"
Bob Ross,"And in our world, maybe there lives, sure does now. A big old evergreen tree lives right there. Now Im turning the brush more. I want this one to be a fat little tree"
Bob Ross,"One day maybe it makes a gorgeous little Christmas tree. Thats what it is. See, fat little tree. So were going almost straight in with the brush. There. Lets give him a couple of friends"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And you know, trees are like people. Theyre all different. Maybe this one here is a little, little skinnier. Maybe this next one over here, I dont know"
Bob Ross,"I add a little touch of paint thinner on my brush because I have a lot of paint behind it. So if you thin that paint, then it will stick. It will stick. Thin paint will stick to a thick paint. See"
Bob Ross,"This trees got some naked spots in it. And well put one more right there, just for the heck of it. Maybe this one heres another old fat one. Like that, oh, I like that. Beautiful little tree"
Bob Ross,"See, there you see it make. And theres one back here that maybe all you can see is just couple little things. He had a bad year. All right. Few little bushes that live right here"
Bob Ross,"That easy, you can create a whole forest. Whole forest lives right here in your brush. Just create little bushes and stuff"
Bob Ross,"Now Ive got several fan brushes going, so I dont have to spend all my time just washing brushes. Let me grab another one"
Bob Ross,"Im going to put some liquid white on my brush, and go into some thalo blue and titanium white. I put the liquid white in there only to thin the color so it will stick to that thicker tree color"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here. Now that we can come back, and we just put a few highlights here and there. I dont want a lot. I dont want to lose that beautiful darkness. Just a few"
Bob Ross,"They look blue is beautiful isnt it. It might be one of my favorite colors. I like that, I like that. There we go. Little more of the liquid white on the brush"
Bob Ross,"Once again, liquid white is there only to thin it. Well just pop in a few little bushy indications here and there. Theres one. You make the decision where they live. Looks cold already. All right"
Bob Ross,"Lets have some fun here. Im going to go right into the titanium white with the two inch brush. This is your bravery test. Load a lot of color in the bristles. Lot of color. All right, here we go"
Bob Ross,"Here we go. I want a nice light area right there, so Im going to start there because as we pick up the black thats underneath and all this color, its going to get darker and darker. That easy"
Bob Ross,I did that very slow so you can see exactly how it goes. I dont want that to be bright in there. Now I want it to get darker as it leaves that area so Im not adding any more white
Bob Ross,"Im allow the brush to pick up the liquid black thats underneath. And automatically, automatically, that will get darker and darker as it works away. About like that. I think I want a house there"
Bob Ross,You know me. I always want to live in these scenes after I paint them. So Im going to put a little cabin right there. A little house
Bob Ross,Now every once in a while I get a letter from somebody and theyll say I love that scene until you put that house in there. I didnt like the house
Bob Ross,"If you dont want a house in your world, leave it out. I just want to show you how. What you put in there is your business. All right. Brown. Just plain old van dyke brown. Little dark sienna"
Bob Ross,"I sort of mix them up all the time so you get a variation but dont over mix them. Leave them, even though you cant see it its so dark, leave them sort of marbled"
Bob Ross,"Then we go back with a little white and some highlight colors. Dark sienna, white, brown. Van dyke brown. When you go back, it picks that up. It will be marbled. It just wont be one old dull color"
Bob Ross,"See there. Just barely touch, just like you were putting snow on the mountain Its all youre doing. Okay, on the side over here, add a little more brown. I want it darker over here"
Bob Ross,Just barely can see theres anything happening in there. Much darker. There. I think we need a door. Today Im going to put a door. Right there
Bob Ross,"Take a little touch of the brown, put some indications like that in there just to make it look like an old cabin living out here. We need a roof. Or this poor man is going to freeze to death"
Bob Ross,Well give him a roof for his cabin. Like that. There we go. Just put it right on there. Over here we need a little bit. Lives right out there. Something like that. All right
Bob Ross,"Got a little too much white right there, so I just lift it off. See, then we put that right back. Once again, we dont make mistakes. Anything that happens here, we can live with it"
Bob Ross,"We can make it work. Okay. Back to our brush. Have some white paint on it. And maybe in our world, right there. Just let that come right through there"
Bob Ross,Beginning to pick up a little bit of the prussian blue on the brush. Very very little though. Just want to begin putting a little cool color and blue is a very cool color. Makes you feel cold. There
Bob Ross,"And you mix that blue, that little bit of blue with the liquid black thats on there. Boy it works. It works. You know what. Lets get crazy. I want a window in here"
Bob Ross,This guyd have to see out and see all that. Maybe a little snow at the bottom of his window. There. Little touches like that sort of makes your painting personal. All right. Find us a fan brush
Bob Ross,"Were going into, into prussian blue and black. Blue and black, or black and blue. Whatever. To do a big tree. Lets go up here and do one. You know me. I think right there"
Bob Ross,"Now all we going to do is tap. Take the brush and just tap. Tap, tap, tap all the way down. All the way down to wherever you want it. I like that. Maybe Ill do another one"
Bob Ross,"Well put a little group of trees here. Two, three, there they come. Three little trees. Three little trees. Maybe, maybe theres a fourth little tree"
Bob Ross,Now Im just going to take the brush and just wiggle it so that the edge of the bristles touch and well just sort of smear in some little doers right here that look like when they highlight them they
Bob Ross,"look like little bushes that live in there. Shoot, thats working pretty good. Maybe well just bounce in. Just taking the brush and just touching to the edge"
Bob Ross,"Just touching the corner and wiggling it quickly, quickly. Its hard to do this slow. Quickly, wiggle it. See, gives this indication of just some little things growing back here"
Bob Ross,"We dont know what they are. Need a liner brush. Take the liner brush, and well go into that same color. Same color, thin some of it out. We want to thin it until its almost like ink"
Bob Ross,"Turn the bristles. That loads it full. Turn them so its very sharp. See, there you can see it. See how sharp it is"
Bob Ross,"Maybe on our tree out here, maybe this is an old evergreen tree thats just about had it. Well put a few old limbs that hang out through here. There. I dont know what kind of tree it really is"
Bob Ross,Whatever you want it to be. You make that big decision. There we go. Evergreen trees if thats what it is always have these little hangy offers off the side. All them little things that hang off there
Bob Ross,Now maybe this tree was a different kind of tree and it has limbs that go up. Like that. Whatever kind of tree you want. Dont just make your limbs just straight. Give them some wiggle and jiggle
Bob Ross,"I have people that write and they say Bob, I dont think I can paint. I have a little shake in my hand.  I think youre ahead of the game"
Bob Ross,A little shake in the hand here plays great great dividends. Now this is winter so were just going to leave the leaves off of that
Bob Ross,"Evergreens sort of keep theirs but these kind of trees, they lose theirs. All right. Something about like that. Back to my fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here, and were just going to tap downward with the brush. Put the indication here and there of a few old, maybe theres a few old limbs left on this rascal. There they come, like that"
Bob Ross,"Now, going back to my brush that I had. Liquid white, titanium white, and a little touch of thalo blue on it. Just load it full of color, and lets go up in here and just want to gently touch"
Bob Ross,"Dont overdo. Dont lose that dark. Just highlight, dont kill it. Gets feeling good, you dont know when to stop sometime. But just enough, just enough to highlight a little"
Bob Ross,"And we can take in here and Ill just, Ill just use this brush, what the heck. We can use anything. Use the old fan brush. Im using a number six sometime. Sometime I pick up a number three"
Bob Ross,I have two different flavors of fan brush. Six and a three. So its up to you. Some people prefer the little brush. Some the big
Bob Ross,"I think it really depends on the effect youre trying to achieve and what youre comfortable with. Thats my armchair philosophy for the day. If it works for you, then its good. Take a little white"
Bob Ross,"Reach right up in the bottom of that. And begin pulling some of that out. Allow it to pick up a little of that color, its okay. When it starts mixing with the liquid black, thats wonderful"
Bob Ross,Dont fight it. Dont fight it. Im going to take a little bit of that color. Just rub it in right there. Something like that. Now we take a little white. Little liquid white
Bob Ross,Got a little blue in it too. Just a little. Now Im going to have this come up. I put the liquid white in there once again to thin it
Bob Ross,I want this to look like maybe theres a big ledge here and stuffs hanging over. And we just sort of blend that back into there. There. I like that. Little right in here
Bob Ross,"Just sort of see these things in your mind, drop them in. Drop them in wherever you think they should live. Maybe that goes all the way down there, I dont know. Little bit in there"
Bob Ross,"I know theres a bush, he lives right here. Just a good place for a little bush. Weve been using a fan brush, so well just continue. Well just continue. Little bit of the blue and the white"
Bob Ross,"Thalo blue, because I just want to highlight this a little. There. Just pushing upward. Give it a little upward push. Put a few little highlighted things in there"
Bob Ross,Just makes it look like some little bushy areas. Take our liner brush. Put a bit of that color we made and tell you what maybe theres a old tree that live right there. There he comes. Old tree
Bob Ross,"Hadnt got any leaves on him. His arms are all naked hanging out here. There. Jack Frost has took his leaves away. Thats okay. Come spring, theyll come back"
Bob Ross,Maybe hes got a little friend lives right there. Its up to you. Up to you. Maybe here and there we can put in just the indication of some little things. Sometimes its fun
Bob Ross,"Take your liner brush, little bit of the liquid white and reach up in here and pull down icicles. Little icicles that hang off your cabin. Tell you what"
Bob Ross,The old clock on the wall tells me its about time to sign this one and call it finished. Lets just sign it right here. I hope youve enjoyed this one. Its a very easy little painting
Bob Ross,"Bring a lot of pleasure into your life. I hope you give it a try. If you do, take a picture of it and send it to us. Wed love to see it here"
Bob Ross,"From all of us here, Id love to wish you happy painting and God bless my friend"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, because today were going to have just a fantastic time"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen, that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you whats happening up here"
Bob Ross,"I thought today Id show ya how to use a black, white and grey gesso to make a fantastic effect"
Bob Ross,"Now Ive taken these three colors of gesso, and using an old liner brush, one that I didnt care anything about, Ive just made some little tree shapes. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"You just pull it down with a liner brush, make a little limb here and there, and then take the liner brush sidewards, and put in these little fluffy areas. It sorta looks like leaves"
Bob Ross,"But thats really all there is to it. After its totally dry, completely dry, Ive covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of Liquid Clear"
Bob Ross,"Now clear is transparent, and you have a tendency to put too much of it on. If you have any doubt in your mind, and you think you may have too much, take a paper towel and wipe your canvas down"
Bob Ross,"Whats left will be just right. Tell you what, lets do it. This is a fun painting that anybody can do. This is a good one. If its your first or second painting, this is wonderful"
Bob Ross,"If youve painted before, this is one thatll, it will certainly excite you. Ill start with a little Phthalo Blue. Its a beautiful, beautiful blue, I love it"
Bob Ross,"Think its one of the nicest colors that we have. Just put a little in the two inch brush, and lets go up in here. Theres not a lot of paint on the brush"
Bob Ross,"And Im just gonna start and just make my little criss-cross strokes, as usual, and paint right over this. And fantastic things will happen. Look at that"
Bob Ross,"Already, it looks like, it looks like the sky is showing right through the trees. This is one of the neatest effects. And its not limited to this, you can do anything with this gesso. There"
Bob Ross,"And where the canvas is dark, Ive used lighter gesso, and vice versa. Look at there, see already we have a basic background in, and done"
Bob Ross,"Lets see, while I got that blue on my brush, Im gonna add a little more of the Prussian Blue, cause its stronger, itll go right over the top"
Bob Ross,"In the corners, Im gonna darken a little, with Prussian Blue. Prussian Blue is much stronger. Much deeper. See there, there we go. Just the corners though"
Bob Ross,"And that, in turn, will make this look brighter. If you make this darker, this gets lighter. Now, weve got Prussian Blue on the brush. Ill just sort of rub a little of that right here on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"I know you cant see anything, but when we put a little color on there, beautiful things will happen. There. Alright, ready to wash the old brush. Thats the fun part. Thats the fun part"
Bob Ross,"Lets wash it. As you know, we wash our brushes with odorless paint thinner Just scrub em off, give it a good shake. brush thuds laughs And cover the entire studio"
Bob Ross,Thats really the fun part of it
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes, when youre walking in the woods, which I do quite frequently, and you look out and you see the light coming through, its so bright, it just, it burns right through the trees"
Bob Ross,"Watch, watch, its easier to show you. Take the brush, Im just gonna take one corner. Just one corner. Thats a beautiful close-up there. One corner, and get a little Titanium White on it"
Bob Ross,"Now come up here. Decide where the suns at back there, shining through all these trees. And very lightly just begin, that light area, and begin working around"
Bob Ross,"Notice that were keeping that corner in the light spot. And we work around and around and around we go, there we are, see there. And begin blending outward. Now this paint is very opaque"
Bob Ross,"Weve used transparent color up until now, and now were getting into opaque color. But that suns burning through there. Lights just zinging right through"
Bob Ross,"But by blending it out, itll become transparent enough that you can still see the tree shapes through there. Thats what were trying to achieve"
Bob Ross,"To me, thats what it looks like when I see the sun shining through. There. You can still make out the images of the trees in there, but theyre washed out"
Bob Ross,"The same as if youre looking at em in the woods, and the sun shinings through. Just like that, and we can blend a little light right on down through here"
Bob Ross,"Up to you, up to you, you decide where it lives. You decide. There. Now you could do this several times to achieve a desired lightness, or a desired brightness. This is about all that I want"
Bob Ross,"I just want that nice spot shining through there strong. I like that when that happens. Okay. brush thuds Actually, I just wanted to clean the brush again. Already, were in business"
Bob Ross,"Now we have to make some big decision. Whats happening here in our world. Lets take some black, and some Prussian Blue. Ill be right back, Im gonna get a little crimson and put in there too"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, maybe even a little Sap Green, a little brown a little Van Dyke, just all the dark colors, it doesnt matter. Okay, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Now in my mind, I see back in here, maybe a little grassy area that lives right underneath these trees, so Ill just tap them a little dark"
Bob Ross,"Dont need much because the black gesso has created most of it. We dont have to worry about it. About like that, thats all were looking for. There. Just let it disappear back in there. Hmm, okay"
Bob Ross,"Same brush, Im gonna go right into some Cad Yellow, some Yellow Ochre. Lets just load some color on the brush here. Tap it, push it, give it a little grunts"
Bob Ross,See that little ridge of paint right there. Its what were looking for. Lets go back up here
Bob Ross,"Now we can come back with this beautiful green color, and just begin tapping in the indication of some little grassy areas that live far away. Far away, very soft. Very soft"
Bob Ross,"There, sneak em around some of those trees. There. Reload the brush as you need it. Alright, but very gently. All you do is barely touching the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Color shows up, it seems like 100 times better, stronger on a black canvas than it does on a white canvas. Its amazing what happens to color. There. See, wherever you want em to be. Wherever"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe a little, a little projection sticks out right there. Maybe, maybe, maybe. We can make a little bump, just by doing that, whatever you want, you decide. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now, Im gonna grab another two inch brush, I have several of em. brush thuds Make sure its good and dry. Small amount of Titanium White on it. Now we put color on here"
Bob Ross,"Even though it doesnt look like it, theres a little bit of that blue that we put on. Very gently pull down. Dont put a lot of color on here. It shows up, once again, so bright"
Bob Ross,"You need very, very little white to do this. Very little. And its important that you pull it straight down. Straight down, okay. Then we go across"
Bob Ross,"Just enough to make it look like a little watery area under here. Now you could just as easy have painted those trees with the gesso in the water, and reflected em"
Bob Ross,"I think in the last series, or series before, I sorta lose track of them, I think we done that, and its gorgeous. You can do it. You can do it. Now, shoot, that worked pretty good"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna go back and get some dark. That was black, blue and oh, crimson, whatever. I want another one over here. I like that one so well"
Bob Ross,"Look at here, well just put us another little little projection that comes right out through here. Little dark color in there. There. Okay, back into our yellows, Indian, Yellow Ochre. Cadmium Yellow"
Bob Ross,"Also I hit a Bright Red, believe it or not, red will dull the color, cause red and green make brown"
Bob Ross,"So every once in a while, I hit a little bit of the Bright Red, sometimes more to dull than to make things bright. There. Just begin forming this. Just begin working with it"
Bob Ross,"Think about the lay of the land. Just drop those little devils in there. Theyre everywhere. There. But isnt that gesso, its one of the most fantastic ideas weve ever come up with"
Bob Ross,"And you can put things in like, like if you wanted to paint a little house or a building, you could do it all with the gesso, and then basically, all you need to do is just take, put some clear over"
Bob Ross,"it, come back with a little color. And its there, that quick. snaps fingers Take a little bit of the, little bit of the Titanium White, and Im gonna put a little touch of reflection under here"
Bob Ross,"Just a touch, just a touch. Dont want a lot. Want to keep this pretty dark, so that light area back here really shines. There we go"
Bob Ross,"About like that, then once again, just go across, just go across, thats all there is to it. Isnt that easy. I knew youd like this one. I think its one of my favorite paintings in the whole series"
Bob Ross,"Its so easy, its great for people who are just beginning to paint, and just beginning to experience The Joy of Painting. Hey, theres a commercial. Alright, lets put some stones in there"
Bob Ross,"Well put some little stones. Im gonna take some, Im gonna take some black and a little Van Dyke Brown, put it in there, just mix it up real good"
Bob Ross,"Little Dark Sienna too, what the heck, little more of the Sienna. Okay, Now Im gonna go over here, and get some paint thinner. Im gonna thin this paint down, til its very thin"
Bob Ross,"Remember our golden rule, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Well thin that down. There, thats good. Thats good, let me clean the knife"
Bob Ross,"Well take some white, oh, well use a little Dark Sienna, a little Van Dyke Brown, Im gonna make a highlight color for the rocks. Oh, I like that, thats good. Its not too bright"
Bob Ross,"Okay, do the same thing again. Im gonna thin this paint with paint thinner, til its pretty thin, pretty thin. Its about the consistency of soft face cream. Or butter that youve left out"
Bob Ross,"You know, sometime you leave the butter out, it gets real soft and gooey, thats what were looking for. Okay, let me clean off my knife"
Bob Ross,"Now probably the easiest way Ive ever found of making very effective little stones, is using a little Filbert brush. Okay, and lets go through the dark color first"
Bob Ross,"Both sides, okay, stay right there and Ill bring the light up. We have both sides full of dark. Im gonna take only one side, and go through light. So we have light, dark, light, dark"
Bob Ross,"Now we can go back in here, and you have to make big decisions. Where does all these little rocks and stones live in your world. You can put a million of em in. Or one or two, its up to you"
Bob Ross,"I like little stones. This is the easiest way, there he is, that I know of to put them in there. Maybe over here, theyre getting a little bigger. Big old rock"
Bob Ross,"But in one stroke, you can put the top and the bottom of the rock in, that easy. Lets put some on the other side. We dont want him left out. There. Look at all those little rocks"
Bob Ross,"I used to agonize over rocks, trying to get them in there, worked myself to death. And, you see how easy it is. If you want great big rocks, then use our little oval brush"
Bob Ross,"Instead of using the knife today, Im just gonna take the liner brush, and just here and there, sort of work a little water line right around the stones, like that, look at there, just let it wander"
Bob Ross,"around. Wherever you want it. Wherever you want it. It just cleans up the edge, and the bottom of these little rocks. There"
Bob Ross,"See there, then they can come on out through here, they can be a few little things. You could do this with a knife if you wanted to. I thought today, well just do it with a little liner brush"
Bob Ross,"But you need a thin paint. So itll just zip right over there. There we go. Something like that, when you do yours, take your time and really, really do em nice"
Bob Ross,"Were a little pressed for time here, so I have to do it a little quicker. But when you do it, just enjoy it, enjoy it. Alright. We gotta put something in our foreground here"
Bob Ross,"Well just go back to our brush thats got all that dark on it. We had blue and black and some brown. See, Sap Green, Alizarin Crimson, bravery test, blows air"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world it comes right across like that. There, just tap that in. Just tap it in. Fill it up. Fill it up, a lot of good dark color in there. There. Now then. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Lets go into our yellow, same thing as we did before. Im just gonna do the same basic thing. Get some green here"
Bob Ross,"By taking that color we had on the brush and going into yellow, automatically, we get green. And then we can begin just putting all kinds of little grassy areas back in here"
Bob Ross,"There they come, there they come. If you just take your time, and you keep tapping this, itll get so smooth, you almost cant believe it. There. Just little soft grassy areas"
Bob Ross,"There they go, right on out. There, a little more paint on the brush. Alright. Just keep working it back and forth though. Something like that. Okay. Just sort of let your imagination go"
Bob Ross,"Painting is so great, because your imagination on that piece of canvas can become reality. Can become reality, and sometimes, we all need to escape from reality. This is the place to do it"
Bob Ross,"Here, everythings peaceful and quiet. Theres no bad things here, these are happy places here. Now, watch here, watch here, watch. Sometimes, come right up in here"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its fun to take this brush, put it up here, and give it a little upward push, watch. Bloop, see that little grassy area. Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Gotta make those noises though, or it doesnt work. There, just like that. Maybe the grass over here is a little taller. You work in layers. There. And we can go back to just tapping. Like that. There"
Bob Ross,"And then maybe, bloop, yep youre right, theres another, bloop, bloop. A little glassy area right there. Wherever you want em. And over here, its much softer. Much, much softer"
Bob Ross,"Over heres where youd wanna, you wanna take your shoes off, and run through there with naked foots. Thatd be fun, I like the feel of grass on the bottom of my feet with no shoes on"
Bob Ross,"I think thats a neat feeling. There. When we were kids, my brother Jim and I, we used to run all through the woods in Florida. Shoot, we were tough, we didnt even wear shoes back then"
Bob Ross,"Probably because we didnt have any. Bloop. More little grassy areas, there. Just as many as you want. You know what we need. You know, dont ya. We need a tree"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some Van Dyke, a little Dark Sienna, mix them together with an old fan brush. And lets have a bravery test, right now. laughs Here we go. I want a tree that lives right there"
Bob Ross,"Oh, right through the pretty rocks. Its okay, we know theyre back there. Just pull it through, blows air. Like that. Big strong tree. See, it just keeps growing. Can always make them bigger"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes, its a son of a gun to try to make them smaller, but you can always make them bigger. Put a big old foot on him out here, so he has something to stand on. There"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets just use a little Filbert. Well take a little white, a little brown. And just, just let that work right down the edge. Thats too bright, I dont like that, too bright"
Bob Ross,"Let me darken it up a little. Too bright, oh thats much better. Thats much better. See, if you dont like something, change it. In your world, you have that kind of power. You can do anything"
Bob Ross,"Anything. There, see it gives the impression of an old rough mean tree lives out here. growls There he is, we need some arms on our tree. Let me wipe that color off. Liner brush, there he is"
Bob Ross,"Little paint thinner, little Van Dyke Brown. There we go. And in our world, theres an arm lives on this tree. Right there, there he is"
Bob Ross,"Put a few arms, lets put some leaves on this tree, so we dont have to put many arms. Maybe theres one that hangs off here that, mmm, there. Now lets put a few leaves on there"
Bob Ross,"We get a fan brush, take some dark color, black, blue. Maybe a little Sap Green, and crimson in it too. And our world, there it is. Push in a little dark first"
Bob Ross,"There, dont wanna cover up all that trunk, but some of it. There we go. Gives us an idea of where some nice limbs are"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna go right into the yellow with that color, since it had blue in it, well have instant green. There, and push upward again. Sometime we push down, sometime upward"
Bob Ross,"Let me get a little more color on here. Its up to you. Up to you, there it comes. See, dont want to get too much of this in here. Just enough to make this old tree stand out and sing in the sunshine"
Bob Ross,"Right there. There it is. There. Okay. Now we can take our old number two inch brush right here, and put a little grass around his foots. Im still feeling crazy, and I got a minute left"
Bob Ross,"I like to do this because it, it upsets my director when were getting low on time, and I do something like whistles. Maybe theres an old tree, fell down"
Bob Ross,"laughs This old tree just fell down, it was tired. Hes a tired old tree, and I can relate to that. Put a little highlight along his edge here. Just use a little brown and white"
Bob Ross,"That was just Van Dyke Brown we made him with, just like the one standing up. This one, this one hes laying down on the job. Laying down on the job. Thats okay, he had a long life"
Bob Ross,"Now he wants to rest. Well put a few old limbs that are still on here. Some coming out from the side, and going out"
Bob Ross,"There, if you had trouble making this slide, all you gotta do is just add a little more paint thinner to it. There, see whole limbs are just, just handing around out here. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Go into a little bit of white, brown, like a lighter color. And we can highlight those a little, just so they stand out. Something like that. There. There, old trees just laying out there asleep"
Bob Ross,"Now then. Lets go back and get our brush thats got the dark color on it. I want a little, I want a little bush living right here, so Ill put one in"
Bob Ross,"In your world, you put them in anywhere you want em. Put some dark in. Go into a little bit of light, Im gonna use a little into the Yellow Ochre side, a little touch"
Bob Ross,"Nah, want more Yellow Ochre than that. If youre not happy with it, change it. Oh, thats better, now Im happier. There we go. There we go, all kinds of little things. Like that"
Bob Ross,"See, you can put these in anywhere that you want em. Just any old place. Just to make it look like theres a little bush right here on the edge. It goes right off the canvas. Happy little bush. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Back to our little liner brush. Little light brown color on it. And here and there and there, we can put in a stick or a twig. Whatever you think, just a couple"
Bob Ross,"And, we had rocks on the other side, let me go back to my Filbert that had the rock color on it. Any maybe over here, theres a rock or two that lives on this side"
Bob Ross,"I know that sides better, but all the rocks didnt move over there. Theres still a couple here. Still a couple, where do they live. Heres one right up against a tree"
Bob Ross,"Yeah, wherever you want em, you decide. There. Maybe right down here at the base of that big tree, lives a little stone. You make the decision, but he may live right there, thats okay"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, I think were about ready for a signature on this one. Take a little paint thinner, a little bit of the Bright Red, and well sign it"
Bob Ross,"I have people write and they say Do you have to sign with red.  Absolutely not, you sign with any color that you want. I just sorta got in the habit of signing with red, and I always do it"
Bob Ross,"Its sorta became a trademark, but you sign in any color that you want. There we are. I think were gonna call that one finished. Hope youve enjoyed it"
Bob Ross,"Id like to hear from you, if you try this black and white and grey gesso, because it does fantastic things. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,Interlude by Larry Owens
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. This is the last show of the 27th series, and Im glad youre with us today. I thought today wed just have a crazy day and just do a little painting"
Bob Ross,Well just sort of see what happens okay. Lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us
Bob Ross,"I took a standard old 18 by 24 inch canvas, and the first thing I did was take white gesso and an old paint roller, one of these old, disposable paint rollers, about three inches across, And I rolled"
Bob Ross,"a lot of gesso on it. And I used a paint roller so it makes all these little designs in it. I dont know if you can see em yet or not, but you will before the paintings over"
Bob Ross,I allowed that to dry completely
Bob Ross,"Then I took acrylic paint, I used some alizarin crimson, and some sienna and a little bit of umber, and just took a foam brush, and here and there just smeared a little acrylic paint"
Bob Ross,"Allowed all that to dry, and then we covered the entire canvas with a very, very thin coat of liquid clear so the canvas is wet"
Bob Ross,"The clear only makes it wet, thats the only reason we put it on there, is to make it wet. So with that, lets just have some fun and see what happens"
Bob Ross,"Lets start today with a little bit of Indian yellow. I like the Indian yellow because its very transparent. Okay, lets go up in here. And well just start right here"
Bob Ross,"And well begin applying this color. Oh, shoot, lets just put it over the entire canvas. What the heck. Anything we dont like, well just change it. But that easy, we can just begin this painting"
Bob Ross,"I like doing paintings like this because theyre very different, and theyre unique, and they excite people. And it gives you a new challenge in your life"
Bob Ross,"If you havent tried one of these, you ought to try it. You know, all the different colors of gesso and acrylic paint that you can put together. You can make fantastic backgrounds"
Bob Ross,And they save you a lot of agony in your painting world. They make painting easy for you
Bob Ross,"And I have got several letters since Ive been doing this about the fact in the art world they say that you shouldnt, maybe this is not permanent. It might only last 100 years"
Bob Ross,"Acrylic under oil, there is some controversy. I realize that. But for what were doing here today, well use that. There we are"
Bob Ross,"All Im doing is just covering the entire canvas with just a little bit of this yellow. Just Indian yellow. As I say, its a transparent yellow. Our other yellows are not transparent. There"
Bob Ross,"Just cover the entire canvas. All right, yeah, that doesnt look bad already. Shoot. Now then. Just doing this to assure that its covered evenly. There we are. Now then. Now lets begin playing"
Bob Ross,"Thats very transparent, as weve said several times. Now Im gon begin taking opaque color. And for that, Im gonna start with a little bit of titanium white, and a very, very small amount"
Bob Ross,"Very small amount. So you can see, it didnt matter how you load it, but just a small amount. And lets just begin picking out some little areas. And begin putting this opaque color on here, very thin"
Bob Ross,"Very thin, I cant say that enough. Just enough to sort of make it look misty in there, thats all Im looking for, is just a little misty appearance"
Bob Ross,"I dont want to lose that nice yellow that we have back there. Just want to create some little effects like this. There we are. See, just let em go. Let em go. Wherever. Doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"This is, even though this is an opaque color, its still transparent enough that you can see the little designs that we have right through there. Maybe up in here"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna sort of bounce around on the canvas and put these in. Here and there, and there and here. Makes no difference. You just sort of look at yours, and you decide. See. Like right here"
Bob Ross,"Good place for one. And every single canvas, especially with these backgrounds like this, every single one will be different and unique. Thats what makes this so gorgeous, that they are different"
Bob Ross,"We want em to be different. We dont wanna teach ya just how to copy a painting. Shoot, we wanna teach ya how to make your own masterpiece. Thats where the fun comes in. Very lightly. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can begin playing with some other colors in here. Maybe a little more white right in there. Lets take, Im gonna go into a little touch of alizarin crimson. Very small amount"
Bob Ross,"And well just begin with it. Just to make little areas in here that have little splotches of color. Its gorgeous. I like to do these type of paintings. Theyre very, once again, theyre very unique"
Bob Ross,"And itll drive people crazy trying to figure out how you made these effects happen. Shh, dont tell em. Dont tell em. Use a little bright red once in a while, too. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Reach up here, get a little white. To make that stand out. Look it there, color just jumps out at you. But most of that is still showing through. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"As I mentioned, this is the last show of the 27th Joy of Painting series. Thats hard to believe that, my gosh, theres over 350 half hour shows now"
Bob Ross,"Its unreal, weve been on television for ten years. Ive been producing these shows for ten years"
Bob Ross,"And in that time period, the Joy of Painting has become the most successful art show in the history of television. And its your fault. And Id like to thank you very, very much for your support"
Bob Ross,And for coming out and seeing us when we come to your town. Thats fantastic. Youve made an old mans dream come true
Bob Ross,"Every artist wants to share his painting with the world, and youve allowed me the opportunity to do this through the miracle of television. So thank you very much"
Bob Ross,"And if you havent got a chance to see all the shows, call your local station. They can get em. There we go. Once in a while, the least little touch of pthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"The least little touch, I dont want much blue. Its too, too strong. Just a little here and there. Little touch of the white, right in there with it. But isnt that a gorgeous background"
Bob Ross,"And its so, so very easy to do. So easy to do. There we go. Now sometimes its fun. Just to take and play a little bit, and thats what well do"
Bob Ross,"Ill tell you what, in down here, lets take, this is alizarin crimson and sap green mixed together to make a nice brown color. And I wanna come in here and just do this"
Bob Ross,"Just take it and pull it straight down. Maybe well have a little water in here, and thisll end up being our water. Alizarin crimson and sap green, mixed together to make a brown color"
Bob Ross,"And you could take it to the reddish side, or the green side, depending on your mood, or what flavor you want in your painting"
Bob Ross,"Normally I go a little bit to the red side, but thats just my preference. Everybodys different. There we are. And well come back and play with that a little later on. Now then. Im gonna take"
Bob Ross,"Make a lavender color. Then Im gonna use a little black, and alizarin crimson, a little bit of pthalo blue in it. Need more crimson, there we go"
Bob Ross,"And well mix up a little pile here, cuz were gonna use it throughout. Gonna have some of it thats to the red side, some to the blue. See, over heres to the red, over heres to the blue"
Bob Ross,"So I have both in the same pile, basically, so I can just sort of go back and forth or mix em together. Okay. Now"
Bob Ross,"As you know, if youve painted with me before, paint thinner and liquid clear have a very unique reaction. A very unique reaction, so were gonna use that to our advantage"
Bob Ross,"Get a little paint thinner up here so I can thin this. Lets just play with some thin paints today. Tell you what, that paint is very thin, its almost like ink"
Bob Ross,"Turn the bristles in the paint and then pull em out so it brings it to a very sharp edge. There, you can see it. Lets go up in here. Gotta make some big decisions"
Bob Ross,"whistling Maybe in our world, there lives a tree right here. Well put a little stalk in, or a little trunk, whatever you want to call it. And let us make several. Just by pulling that"
Bob Ross,"whistling It goes right through there. Shoop, theres another one. You have to make some decisions. How many trees live in your world. Its totally and completely up to you"
Bob Ross,And you can put the indication here and there of a few little branches that come off. They just sort of hang around and have a good time. Here. It dont matter if theyre not perfect
Bob Ross,"Dont worry about it. Dont worry about it, cuz we dont make any mistakes here. We only have some happy accidents. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Ive got quite a few letters asking if theres any place people can go and see some of the paintings that weve done on TV. I really dont, I dont have a place that I display the paintings, Im sorry"
Bob Ross,"We just dont have that. About as close, well, our partner Anette Kowalski has recently opened a little activity center in New Smyrna Beach, where the public is invited and see some of em"
Bob Ross,"If you happen to be in that area, stop by and say hello to her. Theres a lot of my paintings there, and some of hers, and some of our instructors"
Bob Ross,"You know, its a good place just to go and look at paintings. Okay, look here. Take just a little liner with a little paint on it. And get nervous. Just get nervous. See there"
Bob Ross,"Just let that sort of flow. Just make it very loose. Were doin a very loose little painting today. There. You dont have to really worry about this. Just play, have fun. Have fun"
Bob Ross,"I mentioned earlier in one of the shows that I got a letter from somebody one time that said they had a little shake in their hand, and because of that they couldnt paint"
Bob Ross,"Well this is your painting, right here. This is it. If youve ever had any problem at all because of a little shake in your hand, this one is designed just for you. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Just a few little bushes and things that live down here at his foot. And Im just using a script liner brush sidewards. There. Paints very thin, so it just slides right over that clear"
Bob Ross,"Just slides right over it. If it doesnt slide, add more paint thinner. Just keep adding paint thinner. And by changing the angle, you can create all types of effects. There we go"
Bob Ross,All kinds of little things that just live back here in the background. Let your imagination take you wherever you wanna go. Cuz you really dont have to do a lot of painting
Bob Ross,"The undercoating, under-color that was under here takes care of most of that. Shoop, I want another tree there. Maybe theres some little arms hangin off him. There"
Bob Ross,"And then in here, maybe theres a limb or two. Who knows. Little branch or something thats got a few leaves left on it down here. Thats a scraggly old tree. I like old trees that have character"
Bob Ross,Shoot. There. Something like that. All right. Wherever. Wherever. Just bounce these in. You could use a fan brush and do this
Bob Ross,"I just want to sort of show you how much you could do with a little liner brush. Just a plain, ordinary little liner brush. Its a lot of fun. A great deal of fun"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a few little things that grow out here. But be loose, this is a very loose painting. Very loose. Maybe even a few little things out here with some limbs on them like this"
Bob Ross,Just make indications. And. Now the brush is almost empty. I just wanna rub it so. It picks up on the high points of that gesso thats underneath. Just picking up on the high points
Bob Ross,Very little paint on the brush. Very little. Youd be shocked at what a small amount of paint it takes to do this. There. And just creep all kinds of illusions
Bob Ross,And painting is nothing but games of illusion. Thats all it is. See there. Fan brush would be a little bit faster. But I like using this today. There we are
Bob Ross,"Begin thinking maybe the lay of, if this is gonna be water, we want this to sort of tilt down, because water normally always lays in a little recessed area"
Bob Ross,"It wont climb up on a rock and look pretty for ya just to make you happy. Water is lazy, its like me. It always looks for the easiest place to go, which is normally the bottom of the hill"
Bob Ross,So we need to paint in a little hill. So it can run down. There. Something like so. Now Im goin in to a little bit of that brown that I made from sap green and alizarin crimson
Bob Ross,"And well drop in a few little things in here with that, too. Very loose. Very loose. I like these, cuz theres no mistakes here. Absolutely no mistakes. Just fun painting. All right"
Bob Ross,"But just let if barely graze the canvas. Thats the reason I went to all the trouble to put the gesso on, so it has all those high points on there. All right, maybe on this side over here"
Bob Ross,"whistling There you go. Just make a little noise, drop in a little tree. Something like that, give him a friend. And here we are. Just another little limb. Stick, twig, whatever you want to call it"
Bob Ross,"There. Just like that. All right. See. There they are. Wherever you want em. Just drop them in. There. Maybe this comes right on down. I dont know, right on down through here somewhere"
Bob Ross,"Same basic idea. Put all of those little things in. Take a little more of the color. grunting Gotta make those noises. This is an old tree, hes had a rough life. Has he had a rough life"
Bob Ross,"Look at that. These are all gorgeous colors. Theyre transparent, and they work wonderfully. Watch here. I keep talkin about using a fan brush, let me show you how to do it"
Bob Ross,"Thin color, the color that was very thin. And I wanna put a little more, too on there, just in case some of them show through. There. Now we know theres a limb on there"
Bob Ross,"Take the fan brush and just, just do like that. See. While youre doin it, just let it, just go back and forth, and then touch the canvas with it like youre really nervous. Really nervous"
Bob Ross,"And all all these little effects will just, theyll happen for ya. Theyll happen, believe me. Try it. Try it. Yeah, there. Just wherever you want em to be"
Bob Ross,"Down in here youre gonna do the same things. Thats how you could use a fan brush, I just wanted to show you how you could use a liner brush, any old thing that turns you on. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And that easy, you can create the illusion of a beautiful little place. Little more color here. There. That looks like a little place, maybe, where the water runs. Good idea"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes these little things just happen. There we go. And those are called happy accidents. We look for those. We save em, cherish em. Theyre our good friends"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add a little bright red, here and there. Here and there. Im gonna pick up a little yellow ochre. Cad yellow. Just some of the yellows here and there"
Bob Ross,"Just begin popping in a few little, a few little highlights, same way, though. And the paint is quite thin, I have a lot of paint thinner on the brush"
Bob Ross,"I want it to work with that liquid clear thats under there. Something like that. See, all those little effects happen"
Bob Ross,"Theres a lot of depth in there, you havent done hardly anything except just bounce the brush around. Thats all. Now then we take some of that same color. Lets begin to play here"
Bob Ross,"Lets decide maybe this is water. Pull it down. This paint is still thin. Ive thinned it with a little bit of paint thinner. Just pull it straight down like that. Shoop, shoop, shoop"
Bob Ross,"All the way across. And with a clean, dry brush, very gently go across. Just like were making reflections normally. Thats all"
Bob Ross,"Now if you want to have some fun, let me dip that brush into a little thinner and shake most of it out. Ive left a tiny little bit in it. Tiny little bit. And you just go across there"
Bob Ross,"And if theres just enough in there, itll make little openings come in clear. Might not be able to see em yet, amd it takes a little while for them to work, but theyll come in there"
Bob Ross,"Theyre not showing up very well. Lets use the liner brush, see em. It reacts with the. It reacts with the liquid clear there. And these little things just sort of happen"
Bob Ross,"Its a nice way of making what looks like little shine across the water. And its done by removing paint. There we go. Okay. Im gonna take, Im gonna take"
Bob Ross,"Ill use some black, and some of that brown we made, from that sap green, alizarin crimson mixed together. Okay, and Im gonna go over here and get paint thinner. I wanna thin that down. Very thin"
Bob Ross,"Get some paint thinner, thin it down. We want it quite thin. Wipe off the knife. Then Ill take some titanium white, and just some black. Im gonna mix it together to make a grey color. Like so"
Bob Ross,Thin it down. Thin it down. Just adding paint thinner and mixing it up. Thats really all it amounts to. All right. So we have a much thinner paint. Take our little filbert brush
Bob Ross,"And well take it through the dark. And if youve painted with me for a while, you know what were gonna do. Were gonna make some little rocks. Stay right there, and Ill come to you"
Bob Ross,"Now see, take the other side, so we have light on one side, dark on the other. And lets go up in here. And then we can begin figuring out where all these little rocks and stones live"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a lot of them in our world. There they come. See. Just drop em in. Very, very simple way of making these, and its very effective. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe some live right out here on the water, I dont know. Heres a big one. I saw him, right there. Right there, big ol rascal. And heres some that maybe go right off the canvas"
Bob Ross,"They dont stop just because the canvas did. And we have a lot of time, you can pull down a little reflection under each one. And thats really what you want to do"
Bob Ross,"Just each one, pull down a little reflection. Grab it with a big brush, or any brush, and then go gently across. Itll make it look like, make it look like theres a little reflection in the water"
Bob Ross,"Take our liner brush. Im gonna use just a light color. A little bit lighter than whats there. Just go in and, I know you cant hardly see that, I dont want it very bright"
Bob Ross,"Just here and there, put in a few little water lines. But this is a very neat little painting. Its sort of different than anything weve done. But I hope you enjoyed doing little paintings like this"
Bob Ross,"I try to show you as many things as I possibly can, as many different ideas as possible. You pick out the ones you want, and you like, and use em. And do gorgeous paintings for me"
Bob Ross,"And really, if you have time, send me a photograph of what youre doing. Its so fantastic to show on the air here once in a while, paintings that people all over the country are doing"
Bob Ross,"Beautiful paintings. Paintings that people never believed were possible. And if they can do em, you can do em. We have young people in their 90s that are doing there first painting"
Bob Ross,"And its working, and it makes them happy. And if painting does anything for you, it should make you feel good in your heart. I tell you what, I think that ones about ready for old signature"
Bob Ross,Take a little red. And well just put in a quick little signature right here over our rock. And I really hope youve enjoyed this one
Bob Ross,"If youll try it, youll find that its one of the most fantastic ways of painting that youve ever seen. Take your time and play with these"
Bob Ross,"You know, here weve done most of this painting using nothing but a liner brush, a fan brush, and a filbert brush"
Bob Ross,"Well, I did use a two inch brush just to put the background in, but you could do it with anything"
Bob Ross,"And this little painting, when you show it to friends and neighbors, theyre not gonna believe that you done it"
Bob Ross,"Over and over again I get letters from people and they say, My friends took, and they looked here, and they tried to find the numbers that were behind the painting.  Enjoy painting"
Bob Ross,It does wonderful things for you. It makes beautiful gifts for everybody that you love and who loves you. And you know I would like to take just a second and thank you
Bob Ross,In the last series I happened to mention that I had lost my wife. I have received hundreds and hundreds of cards from people all over the country expressing their sympathy and support
Bob Ross,"From the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing in my grief, and for making my wife a very special person in your life, too"
Bob Ross,"On behalf of Walt and Anette Kowalski, everybody here at the station, Id like to wish each and every one of you happy painting, God bless, and Ill see you next series"
Bob Ross,"Until then, take care of yourself. mellow soft rock music"
