Bob Ross,Music oh hello Im Bob Ross and Id like to welcome you to The Joy of Painting this is a weton wet painting technique and each week Ill take you step by step through a beautiful oil painting if
Bob Ross,youve been with us before Im glad to see you again if this is your first time with us drag up your paints and your big brush come along and paint with us and lets go ahead and get started and talk
Bob Ross,a little bit about what were going to do up here Ive already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of liquid white and this makes the canvas wet makes it slick it allows us to blend color right
Bob Ross,here on on the canvas and now Im going to have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this project with me and itll come across in the same order that I have
Bob Ross,them on the pallet starting with the titanium white and working around while theyre doing that lets go on up here and get started now Im going to start with o 2in brush today and go right into a
Bob Ross,small amount of a lizin crimson and just really tap the brush into the color just tap it this assures a nice even distribution of paint all the way through the bristles okay lets go up here lets go
Bob Ross,right in here and just make little little crisscross Strokes little xs and put in a little tiny bit of pink just like so using very little pressure just apply it right on the canvas dont want that
Bob Ross,to get too bright we dont want to set the sky on fire we just want a little pinkish Glow In The Sky okay now then Ill take the same old dirty brush add a little more of the crimson and a tin tiny
Bob Ross,tiny bit of phthalo blue proportionately we want much much more Crimson than blue and Im just mixing this right on the brush to make a nice lavender color nice purplish color okay lets go up here
Bob Ross,and sort of test it now sort of test it up here if its not the color you want stop and change it you can fix it this is your world and you can create any type of Illusion that you want here youre
Bob Ross,the boss on this canvas you can do anything any thing okay a little more paint and just sort of let that play around Im going to add a little more blue to that tiny bit more blue there today I
Bob Ross,thought wed do a nice painting its very soft and very quiet and itll itll make you happy its a very easy little painting there we go and down here Ill just clean the brush off just like so okay
Bob Ross,now then lets clean our brush we clean our brushes with odorless thinner and be sure its odorless or youll be working by yourself shake off the excess and right down here I have a box I shake the
Bob Ross,brush into and then this is where you take out all your frustrations maybe the absolute most fun of this whole technique okay now lets take the clean brush and go right back up here and just blend
Bob Ross,the sky together still using little crisscross Strokes still using them back and forth back and forth there we go okay and you can blend this to any degree of softness that you want you can blend it
Bob Ross,till you lose all the little variations that you have and personally I like to leave some of those in there but when youre doing your painting you look at it and you do it the way that you want it
Bob Ross,okay there we go and that quickly we have a very effective little sky and well just use long strokes here to take out any brush marks okay and that gives us a happy little Sky now then lets take a
Bob Ross,little bit of the phthalo blue and the lizar and Crimson well just mix it together still we have a little bit more of the Crimson than we do blue were still working with a nice lavender color pull
Bob Ross,it out very flat and then how to cross it so theres a small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife there we go okay lets go right up here maybe theres a a happy little mountain that lives
Bob Ross,right along here and youre really pushing this paint right into the fabric really get firm with it youre not going to hurt this canvas shoot they make tents out of it this tough really push it in
Bob Ross,use a lot of pressure lot of pressure all only thing youre worried about is this nice outside shape here you could care less whats happening down here okay and that gives us a basic little little
Bob Ross,mountain shape now then lets go back to our large brush and grab that and pull it just pull it now thats mixing with the liquid white and automatically it gets lighter toward the base and if you can
Bob Ross,see the entire Mountain it should be lighter at the bottom than it is at the top and as we said on previous shows because at the bottom you have misted and now we have pollution and these things have
Bob Ross,a tendency to break up and diffuse light so it looks softer at the bottom now by just taking the knife here we can create the illusion of highlights and shadows just push very firmly you can take the
Bob Ross,least little touch of titanium White we want these mountains to be far far away so they dont have much detail just barely barely touch smallest amount of the titanium white and Im rubbing it okay
Bob Ross,lets put a little tiny bit right there then we can just rub that right in see it creates the illusion of all kind of things happening without you actually doing a whole bunch and it keeps that
Bob Ross,mountain looking like its far far far away far away far away there we go maybe a little touch right in there wherever you just make a decision in your mountain and put it wherever you want it and
Bob Ross,then we can tap that and blend it a little bit and that mountain should look just like its just laying there and just floating in the sky very soft very quiet h okay lets have some fun now maybe
Bob Ross,theres a little footy Hill that lives right down here so well just keep using this old 2-in brush Im going to take a little blue a little bit of crimson and Ill just mix them right on the brush
Bob Ross,Well add a tiny little bit of white in there too so weve got lizard Crimson little bit of phthalo blue and a touch of white okay and Im just tapping the brush just tapping it lets go right back up
Bob Ross,here maybe theres a little foot Hill that lives right here and all you need is just the corner of the brush and just begin laying in some basic shapes just sort of let your brush touch and pull
Bob Ross,downward touch pull downward straight down straight down and maybe they come right on down here wherever you want them a little more paint there we go there they are just right on down now then I want
Bob Ross,to create the illusion of mist right under the bottom of this Foothill so Ill take a clean 2in brush Im going to come right here and tap firmly maybe you can hear that tapping very firmly and
Bob Ross,thatll create the illusion of mist at the base of these Foothills just like so okay and then very lightly lift upward just lift it straight up straight up and then blend it out okay maybe tell you
Bob Ross,what maybe theres another layer of Foothills in there so lets go right into the same color lizard crims and phthalo blue but I want it a little bit darker as things get closer to you in a landscape
Bob Ross,they should get a little darker in value okay lets go right back here lets start right here and maybe well just bring this one down and let it drop there there it is there it is just right on down
Bob Ross,right on down see its a little bit darker so it stands out might even add the smallest smallest Touch of sap green to that the smallest touch I just want to begin giving the indication of a little
Bob Ross,green far far back here okay then well take our clean dry brush and once again I want to create that illusion of mist down here at the bottom so we tap very firm very firmly and youre using just the
Bob Ross,there you can see see just the top corner of the brush strike the canvas just like so just like it and that easy you have missed right at the bottom of that Foothill and then lift upward there aint
Bob Ross,that something okay well wash the steel brush here I like to wash the brush thats most fun part of course everybody in the studio is covered okay now then lets begin putting some little things that
Bob Ross,are happening wee we back in the distance Im going back into this lavender color I made and add a tiny tiny bit of sap green just the smallest amount and all Im doing is tapping just still tapping
Bob Ross,okay lets go right up here there may be back in here way back in here theres just a little soft Hill lives way back here very gentle there and were going to put layer after layer after layer of
Bob Ross,little Hills back here now if you live in in the Carolinas of some place that have the beautiful beautiful Hills that this is a a super way to make them you can make all those beautiful mountains that
Bob Ross,you have in that area the same way just leave this big one out there we go little bit more color on the brush maybe I tell you what maybe theres one that comes from this direction I want to add a
Bob Ross,little touch more of blue in there there we are thats better now we want them to get a little darker as they get closer so all were doing is just tapping very gently okay okay a little more of the
Bob Ross,green into that color and you have to make Almighty decisions here maybe this one comes right down there it is look at that see now each time you do this youre creating planes in here and each plane
Bob Ross,that you add into your painting makes your painting look deeper shows much more depth in it and of course were not interested in that Almighty dollar but if you should be thats what sells the
Bob Ross,painting there we go there we go see just layer after layer after layer I tell you what lets have some fun lets have some fun let me grab a fan brush here and well mix up same old color poo blue
Bob Ross,lizard and crimson and Im going to add a little bit of white to that little bit of white there we go little bit more of the Crimson good okay let me wipe the knife off now were going to load this
Bob Ross,fan brush full of paint just really load it full wiggle it in there okay lets go right up here maybe back here lives a happy little tree little evergreen tree now just sort of touch it to give you a
Bob Ross,center and then give it a little upward push sometimes you make Evergreens by pushing down sometime by pushing upward today I thought wed do it upward look at all the little things happen there look
Bob Ross,at that look at that cute little tree and we dont want him to get lonely so lets give him a happy little friend this little friend lives right there trees need friends too we all all need a friend
Bob Ross,there he is okay and you know what happens if theres two trees sooner or later little son of a guns are going to get together and heres a little tree he lives right here beside him just like so okay
Bob Ross,now in your painting you put as many trees as you want Im going to put three right there maybe I tell you what lets have a little tree a little tiny tree lives right there and we make him the same
Bob Ross,way only smaller just make him a little smaller and go out and study trees make friends with trees you know I talk about going out in the woods and and sitting around and talking to trees theres
Bob Ross,nothing wrong with that thats the way you learn what makes a tree look like a tree spend some time with nature let it become your good friend now put some more trees right out in there see there you
Bob Ross,can just put trees wherever you want them tell you what Lets do lets take this brush and see right here at the base Im going to take this brush and just begin picking up some of that color and
Bob Ross,tapping all Im doing is tapping now Im going to begin adding a little color to that little yellow ochre little CAD yellow just very lightly and then again creating little highlights on all these
Bob Ross,little Hills just let them all blend together just a nice soft little Meadow back here add a little Indian yellow and here and there little touch of bright red tiniest little amount of the red though
Bob Ross,there we go just just to highlight a little dont get carried away all right okay and Im just sort of mixing all of these yellows and reds together on the brush there we are just let them there see
Bob Ross,how that begins to soften and creates the illusion of depth thats what were looking for all right I tell you what lets go back into this same old color the blue and the crimson and the white get
Bob Ross,the old brush all loaded up here a lot of paint lets go back up here maybe in here some more little trees just give it a little push upward and once again in your painting you put as many or as few
Bob Ross,trees as you want but the more you make the more practice you get and if theres a secret to painting its practice its practice the more you paint the easier it becomes its like anything else when
Bob Ross,you first first started tying your shoe probably probably didnt work first time you had to practice it a few times and now you can do it without even looking and its the same way with p pretty soon
Bob Ross,you can do it and its almost oh it it just happens you dont have to worry about how to load this brush you can spend your thinking time worrying about composition and and begin looking at things in
Bob Ross,the painting thats when its fun thats when you truly experience The Joy of Painting maybe tell you what maybe right here this old tree he didnt make it in nature you have trees that oh oh maybe
Bob Ross,maybe somebody stepped on them when they was little and they got a little little herd in them and they died but you have dead trees in nature too so put some of those in your painting it makes them
Bob Ross,look real okay well just drop in a another little tree or two okay then once again we just grab the bottom of that and let it go tap it right on that and we can take our liner brush and Ill use a
Bob Ross,little bit of the liquid black on it and just put a a little indication here and there of a few old few old limbs that are still hanging off these dead trees back here a that easy we got her okay now
Bob Ross,then take some more blue some more Crimson there we go all right lets lets come right down here and here comes another Hill and all were doing is initially laying in the base color the dark color
Bob Ross,just like so and dont cover it completely leave some of these areas that are light in here these will create all kinds of beautiful effects when youre finished and as you know if youve painted with
Bob Ross,us before we dont make mistakes we have happy accidents so learn to work with these things anything that happens learn to use it learn to use it let it be your friend sometimes you you have a
Bob Ross,tendency to fight painting and just just work with whatever happens whatever happens there we go see and you begin begin creating the curvature of the land here or the lay of the land just sort of let
Bob Ross,your mind wonder and enjoy painting should make you happy should really make you happy there we go you know the one thing if painting teaches you nothing else it teaches you to look at nature I get
Bob Ross,letters every day from Fantastic people that say Bob Ive looked at the tree in my front yard ever since it was a little baby and I never really seen it till I started painting and thats true thats
Bob Ross,so true painting it teaches you to see to appreciate pretty soon youre youre riding down the street and you say oh my gosh look at that tree that tree is made of sap green with a little blue in it
Bob Ross,or that cloud can be done with a fan brush of course you have to be careful you wrecked the car when youre doing things like that but okay Im going to add the least little touch of white and a
Bob Ross,little bit of red right on the brush just tapping it in just tapping okay maybe theres a little light that plays right through here I want this to be a little bright area right in there so all Im
Bob Ross,going to do is just sort of tap that on and maybe like right there right there right there just take go right into a little bit of yellow add a little green to that and Im using all the yellows here
Bob Ross,little touch of the red touch of the red its very strong okay lets go back up here now then we can begin just tapping on some highlights here see there look at that look at that and begin Once Again
Bob Ross,Begin thinking about the lay of the land just sort of Let it Flow because on this piece of canvas you can create anything anything there we go see now if you want to create little Hills it should be
Bob Ross,brighter on top than it is down here and that gives the illusion of a little Hill like a light striking up here and that it get darker darker darker darker as it works down just let it go you know
Bob Ross,Ive painted thousands and thousands of paintings and I still get excited when I see it work its so fantastic there we go look at all the little Hills and little ridges and you can do it you can do
Bob Ross,it there we go see that little bright area is just it just shows up little Sun striking right through there pretty when its done little touch right there okay lets really have some fun now Im going
Bob Ross,to go right into the the midnight black and Im going to add a little bit of Van djk Brown just mix it right on the brush lot of paint lot of paint okay lets go up here maybe theres some some big
Bob Ross,trees that live in here and I think one lives right there and all Im going to do is just tap just tap just come right down like so just tap it in and I have several fan brushes going here so I dont
Bob Ross,have to wash them take a little bit of the white right on this brush and watch here were going to come right down this Edge right down the edge and well put some highlight right on that tree and
Bob Ross,that easy that easy you have a nice strong tree trunk H that was fun lets do another one lets do another one same color little brown and black now you had to make a decision where is the trees live
Bob Ross,in your painting I know right there there he comes and all these trees arent perfectly straight like telephone poles let them let them have a little character trees are like people each one has has
Bob Ross,its own individual personality oh I feel there ought to be one right there right across the mountain every tree is different once again spend some time with nature go out and go out and talk to a tree
Bob Ross,dont matter people think youre crazy us painters you know they think were a little weird anyway so its all right thats all right tell you what maybe okay right here well have a smaller tree that
Bob Ross,lives right here on this little Hill well push him back like can okay lets go over the other side here we dont want this side to have all the trees so well put theres one right there Loop loopop
Bob Ross,just drop it off this is just black with brown ah big one right there big old tree little more of the brown big old tree he comes right down like it see there look how easy they are to make and well
Bob Ross,take our other fan brush that has the white on it and very quickly you can just go right along here and just drop on a little bit of highlight remember which side the lights coming from from and if
Bob Ross,youre right-handed its normally easier to have the light coming from the right if youre left-handed itll vary from person to person okay lets go right along here and just drop on some little
Bob Ross,things like so just like so okay lets take a liner brush and Im going to put a little bit of the liquid black out here on my palette take make our liner brush and Im add a little tiny bit of
Bob Ross,thinner to it so its very thin turn that brush bring it to a nice Point lets go right here now then here and there just drop on a few happy little limbs little arms on the trees yeah old trees got
Bob Ross,some arms see just wherever you think they should live and Old Pine trees always have old broken ones all over look at that look at that this is just liquid black with a little bit of thinner in it
Bob Ross,and you can put as many or as few as you want few back in here we dont want this old tree to be left out there we go okay lets go over here put a little bit right there right there but this is a
Bob Ross,very nice painting if its your first painting project its works very well if youve painted with me before its a paint going give you a lot of fun there gives us a few indications of some limbs now
Bob Ross,then lets take lets take the old fan brush Im going to use some of the black still and well drop a few little leaves on these trees okay lets go right up here and we touch and give it a little

Bob Ross,thats unpainted thatll end up being very pretty now I have several brushes going so I dont have to clean them okay now right here where this blue and pink go together Im just going to blend this
Bob Ross,till its nice and soft so you cant tell where one color stops and the next one starts look at that and then very lightly just take the brush Strokes out down here in the water all the way across see

Bob Ross,have some nice little background trees now then well just take a knife Im just using the small one but either one will work and just take and just scratch in a few little stick and Twig indications
Bob Ross,here or you can take your liner brush and paint them in I find it a little faster just to drop them in with a knife there we go all right now then same old dirty brush now Im going to go right into
Bob Ross,the yellows this is a little bit of yellow ochre little CAD yellow shoot well take a little Indian yellow and some sap green and we just mix them right on the brush my yellows are a little bit
Bob Ross,thinner than my other paints so they mix easier okay lets go right up here now then lets put some highlights on some of these and Im just taking the top corner of the brush and all Im doing is
Bob Ross,just barely touching just barely touching see and make little forms and shapes in there okay just look at that look at that look at that just drop it in all kinds of little things let them happen B
Bob Ross,them happen remember theres layers back here theres not just one old Bush living back here theres layers and thats what helps create the illusion of depth distance in your painting and a least
Bob Ross,little touch of the red oh put a nice red one right there that one will really stand out pretty little level okay little color on that I just sort of work these yellows and reds back and forth just to
Bob Ross,create whatever effect that you want remember this is your world and you can do anything it makes you happy on here any little thing there we go little bit right there and that quick you have a very
Bob Ross,very nice effective little background now then lets begin working forward on this and putting some more distance into it Im going to go right into these Browns that I had same color I made the trees
Bob Ross,with little dark Sienna a little vany brown okay lets put in some base color here and all Im going to do is just tap begin thinking about the lay of the land how do you want your land to flow I want
Bob Ross,it to sort of come down like C look at there just like so just like yeah all right you know its hard for me to believe with the completion of this series well have over 100 half hour shows thats
Bob Ross,almost un real to me its fantastic its fantastic now Im going to pull down a little bit of that color and this will end up being Reflections just pull it straight down straight down like that look
Bob Ross,at there see instant Reflections very lightly go across just go right across and then take another old brush here same size this 2in brush well go into a little green little yellow and Im just going
Bob Ross,to tap some of these colors on here same colors we used to highlight the trees in the back okay lets go right up here now then begin at the most distant area and start working forward all were doing
Bob Ross,see Ill do that real slow so you can see it just tap and you work in layers work in layers okay here comes another layer and let it follow through just like bowling see Let It follow through there
Bob Ross,just let it come right on down layer after layer after layer however many layers that you want wherever you want it to go okay see there that easy creates the illusion of land back here and painting
Bob Ross,is just games of Illusions thats really all it is okay now lets take the knife take a little bit of brown and back in here well put the indication of a little bit of dirt got to have something for
Bob Ross,all these little things to live on just a little brown this is a little bandik just rubbing it on and Ill take a little brown and white same color just brown and white and add the least little touch
Bob Ross,of highlight here and there dont overdo just a little thats super little bit of the liquid white cut across it and well put a happy little water line back here not too much this is done with a very
Bob Ross,firm pressure youre really cutting into the canvas just get tough with it just get tough with it and keep these lines basically straight you dont want your water to run right out of your painting
Bob Ross,okay Ill add a little more of the Browns here lets go right here so you just keep keep making decisions build plane after plane as many planes as you want in your world complete the area thats a
Bob Ross,farthest away first and work forward few little happy Reflections just by pulling straight down going across very light just whisper light now I have two brushes going here so I dont have to clean
Bob Ross,them each time go back into my brush it has the yellows on it tap a little color put a little bit of the bright red on there there we go lets go up here o is that pretty look at that just all kinds
Bob Ross,of little things there and if you want one to stand out add a little brighter color to it look at there see that little that little hill now stands out from all the rest maybe well make that one
Bob Ross,stand out a little more too okay we need little bit of ground area underneath this one dont want it to get get upset because it doesnt have any okay A little bit of the brown and white highlight
Bob Ross,color just barely touch barely touch then Ill just tap a little color in there and thatll bring all that together okay thats such a pretty little area shoot if if I was there Id have to have a
Bob Ross,little cabin right there lets do that lets go right into some van Dy Brown and right here right here well start with a back Eve just drop that in then do the other side of the roof that easy need a

Bob Ross,need a way to get in and out of this nice little cabin little touch of lighter Im still using a small knife okay I going to take a little tiny bit of blue and white and put the indication maybe
Bob Ross,theres a little window right there and well put one right there just the least little hint of blue okay now then lets take a fan brush we will use some yellow and some greens all right lets go
Bob Ross,right up here now then we can just pop in some happy little bushes and this cleans up the the bottom of the cabin just cleans it all up and this guys like me he didnt cut his lawn very well and its
Bob Ross,growing up around the around the edge of his house so let them little weeds grow right up around his house and maybe we can take the little knife here put the indication of a little tiny path right

Bob Ross,right going I tell you this was a fun little painting I knew youd enjoy it I knew youd enjoy it Im going to use some of the Browns and greens again okay lets go right up here maybe theres a big
Bob Ross,old tree and he lives yep youre right he lives right there and he hangs right out there thats what I used to do when I was a kid I just would hang out thats what this tree is doing its just sort
Bob Ross,of hanging out here having a good time there we go maybe he comes right on down here all kind of little bushes are happening there they go oh look at there another little Peninsula comes right out
Bob Ross,here just sort of let these things happen dont dont try to plan everything let them happen let them happen thats when it becomes fun okay now very lightly well pull a little touch of that down
Bob Ross,like so and thatll as we know going end up being Reflections pull it down very lightly go across very lightly now then we need some land so well we just drop the land in now there we go little bit
Bob Ross,of the brown and white maybe throw at least a little touch of blue in there thatll thatll give it a sort of a gray color but dont over mix your color dont over mix it let all these things just
Bob Ross,sort of happen all right Im going to take a little liquid white on my liner brush and maybe over here theres a tree trunk hes sort of a light color see there turn that brush it makes all kinds of
Bob Ross,little things just happen makes it a little more interesting than just a straight old tree trunk give it a little turn little wiggle all kinds of pretty things and wherever you want them maybe theres
Bob Ross,one yep is right there okay now then now then we can we can put some highlights on that tree well take some of the yellow little sap green load this 2in brush full of paint really load it full okay
Bob Ross,lets go right up here now then you dont want to cover all the dark see just highlight these and if your paint is too thick and wont stick add a tiny tiny little bit of the liquid white or paint
Bob Ross,thinner either one this is sticking very well but if youre having trouble thats the way you make it stick you start with a very thick base color very thick paint and then you can add layers of
Bob Ross,thinner paint right over the top of it pH look at all those little leaves happening there see and think about patterns here think about theres limbs that create these little things dont just dont
Bob Ross,just throw them in down here we got some happy little bushes that live look at all them look at there there is one wherever you want them add a little bit of the red well get bright right o nice one
Bob Ross,nice one Sometimes some of these colors happen and makes me excited just they just jump right out there on you now with just a clean knife we can create the illusion of a few little sticks and twigs
Bob Ross,wherever you want them a little bit of liquid white and well put a water line right under this see that cleans up the bottom and and sort of separates everything look at there a few little ripples on
Bob Ross,the water keep those straight also most important most important I tell you what lets have some fun now watch right here lets bring the camera right up in here I want you to see this very close okay
Bob Ross,come right up here all right watch now Im going to take the contact paper off look at that look at that at that fantastic I told you youd like that told you youd like that now then lets really
Bob Ross,have some fun already didnt that make a beautiful little paint There lives a tree right here big tree I know theres a big tree right here still using just the brown even going to go into a little
Bob Ross,bit of the blue and a little bit of crimson there and I want this to just sort of come right on around what makes this interesting is that it breaks the borders breaks the borders just sort of let
Bob Ross,this sort of float around wherever you want it to go now if youre interested in selling paintings this one will this one will load your wallet up this is it all these colors all Im doing is putting
Bob Ross,a dark base color in here so we can we can come back and put some highlights on them maybe yep look at there see theres a little projection comes right out there and you can make as many of these
Bob Ross,little projections little peninsulas as you want in your painting and they help create the illusion of depth distance I know you hear me say that over and over but to me its very important to have
Bob Ross,paintings that have depth in them dont like paintings that are flat now very lightly go across yeah then maybe well just bring this right on down I no lets have it come Wheeling over here why not
Bob Ross,now when youre doing this you let it go wherever you want it see just very lightly very lightly but a that exciting when you pull that contact paper off and and there it sits I think thats one of
Bob Ross,the most beautiful little paintings weve ever done in any of the series it just it just makes you feel good okay let me get a fan brush here Ill go right into some of the Browns okay lets go up
Bob Ross,here lets put a happy little tree trunk right there right there there go well give him a little friend trees get lonely they need friends take a little bit of brown and white touch of the red touch
Bob Ross,of the red boy its so strong now then lets just take the knife and just drop in some nice little highlights here and there just to make that old tree stand right out look at that just pops him right
Bob Ross,out there okay now then Im going to take the liner brush a little bit of liquid black on it and just put the indication here and there hope you can see those its quite dark well have some come
Bob Ross,right on out here see there just some nice little nice little limbs there they come wherever you want them there theres one over there see just as many of or as few as you want you take a little bit
Bob Ross,of the liquid white and very lightly highlight them make them stand out like so okay back to my knife Im going to put a little land right here just sort of let it come right around wanted to make it
Bob Ross,look like it just sort of sort of goes around the corner little bit of the brown and white highlight like that little bit of liquid white thatll cut us in a nice little water line all right now then
Bob Ross,lets go back to our 2-in brush that has the color on it and lets begin putting in some little high lights all were doing here is just barely tapping the yellows and the greens see dont kill all
Bob Ross,your darks I know you get tired of hearing me say that but it is so important if you kill all those darks then youre going to lose your depth in your tree oh to lose it see that dark makes that
Bob Ross,really stand out and as I said earlier if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little bit of liquid White or a little bit of thinner either one the liquid white will make your color a little
Bob Ross,lighter if you use thinner the color Remains the Same but the paint gets thinner so thats why they call it thinner huh all right you didnt think I knew that there okay now once again here youre
Bob Ross,working in layers see create one layer at a time and work forward forward forward forward forward its most most important that you do that and create the illusion of little bushes and little trees
Bob Ross,and all these little happy things let a little this color just wander right on over here we dont know where it goes I really really hope youve enjoyed this painting as much as Ive enjoyed bringing
Bob Ross,it to you this was something I worked on for quite a while and Ive been waiting to show it to you cuz I knew youd be excited about it I tell you what I think were about ready to sign that one take
Bob Ross,a little bit of the bright red on my liner brush just go right here well sign this one call it finished and once again I really hope youve enjoyed this one its been a great pleasure bringing it to
Bob Ross,you and so from all of us here until next time happy painting God bless Music hi
Bob Ross,all right im glad you could join me today today i thought wed do a nice beautiful little winter scene thats sort of warm and has a beautiful little glow and i think itll make you happy so lets
Bob Ross,have them start off and run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting and theyll come across in the same order as i have them on my palette now ive already covered the
Bob Ross,canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white its wet and slick its all ready to go lets have some fun start today with a little one-inch brush go into a little bit of cad yellow and the tiniest
Bob Ross,tiniest little amount of the bright red tiny little amount cant say that enough just work a little bit into the bristles lets go right up here im going to have a sun in this painting so well have
Bob Ross,the sun right about there and we start off just making a little circle thats all you got to do like so okay now im going to wash the brush and we wash our brushes and odorless thinner and just beat
Bob Ross,the devil out of it okay now then im gonna go into titanium white and well come right down here and get a little touch of alizarin crimson just like so okay now lets go right up in here and well
Bob Ross,work this in using little little crisscross strokes little xs now if you use these little crisscross strokes rather than drawing a big circle its much much easier to blend all these colors together
Bob Ross,id really recommend you use these little strokes okay like so maybe ill add the least a little touch of crimson here and make it a little bit brighter so you can see it better on yourself sometimes
Bob Ross,some of these colors are so soft its hard to see and well bring it right on out like that normally when were doing these paintings for television we paint a little brighter than we would at home so
Bob Ross,when youre painting at home you paint any way that makes you happy bring it right on down like that okay im gonna go to a two inch brush its a little bit faster now go right into the crimson
Bob Ross,tiniest little bit tiniest little bit and then im going to add just a small amount of the dark sienna to the crimson make a very warm brown okay lets go back up here now very lightly right around
Bob Ross,here still making the little crisscross strokes very soft quiet gentle little sky but very effective very effective this is a type painting that people put in their living rooms just make it look warm
Bob Ross,theyre good sellers if youre interested in selling paintings so many people write and tell me that theyre theyre selling paintings that they and they never even believed they could paint but that
Bob Ross,really makes me happy when people write and tell me that and its not the money the money is not important its what it does to your ego and inside here because if somebodys willing to pay you for
Bob Ross,something you painted with your hand then oh it makes you want to go home and paint 10 more paintings thats whats important its not the money going right into van dyke brown sometimes i talk too
Bob Ross,much i have to hush get excited van dyke brown still making a little crisscross now this is mixing with the liquid white and all of these beautiful little things just happen okay a little bit more of
Bob Ross,the brown and right there right there look at that that looks just like an egg i cooked this morning bad news im not much of a cook ill take just lay a little tiny bit of this brownish color down in
Bob Ross,here and without even cleaning the brush the least little touch of phthalo blue tiny tiniest little amount okay and well just lay a little bit of that just here and there just here and there and you
Bob Ross,can add a little alizarin crimson im just putting some colors down here dont worry about blending them together or mixing them at this point all right lets lay that brush down and i have several of
Bob Ross,these two inch brushes going and im gonna go right up here and begin blending still using little crisscross strokes and you really want to blend this out just blend it blend it blended working
Bob Ross,outward you dont want to bring the dark color in toward the center blend it outward there and you want to blend this so you cant tell where one color stops and the next one starts very soft and very
Bob Ross,gentle and then very lightly just take out the brush strokes and if you happen to get a hair on your canvas like i did there just take the corner of the brush and pop it off thats all there is to it
Bob Ross,now then now then lets have some fun well put a sun up in here and for that im going to use my finger lets go right here take a little white and im just going to rub it right in just make a
Bob Ross,little circle the sun looks a little better if its round them square sun sort of bother you there you go see you just push that right in there make a little circle now if you tried blending that it
Bob Ross,would smear so take your knife come right up here and watch take your knife and just go boop take it right off the value or the color remains in the canvas now you can come along here and see you can
Bob Ross,blend that and that easy that easy you have a happy little sun all right and that completes our sky now we can have some fun and begin painting now you have to make a decision here okay im going to
Bob Ross,use the round brush go into van dyck brown a little dark sienna im just going to mix them on the brush just tap it see just tap there we go lets go right up here maybe theres a happy little tree
Bob Ross,that lives right here and then well start at the base of this tree and work upwards so automatically automatically its going to mix with the liquid white and its going to be darker at the bottom
Bob Ross,than it is on the top and you have your shadows without even trying darker darker darker down toward the bottom there we go maybe theres a happy little tree or bush that lives there begin thinking
Bob Ross,about the lay of the land or the way the the ground flows im gonna have a little hill here so thats what im again working on were not worried a great deal about detail at this point but all were
Bob Ross,interested in is the general lay of the land oh theres another one see just let these little things just sort of fall out of your brush they live in there sometimes you have to tap them out a little
Bob Ross,bit but they live in there there we go and well pull a little bit of that color down just the bottom because thatll end up being our shadows in the snow so use all these things while you got this
Bob Ross,little dark color on the brush you can use it now then im going to take a little bit of the liquid black out here on my palette take my liner brush add a little paint thinner and then work that brush
Bob Ross,in there and turn it turn it bring it to a super sharp point look at that very sharp all right now then in here in here put just the indication of a few little trunks little stems whatever you want to
Bob Ross,call them limbs arms whatever okay now one of the questions i get asked a great deal is do you pull it down or do you go up it doesnt matter try it both ways and most people find it works better one
Bob Ross,way than it does the other now normally i pull down because its easier for you to see it that way when im painting at home a lot of times ill pull up i dont think theres any rule you just sort of
Bob Ross,practice and find which way works for you there we try to show you as many ways as possible and turn you loose on the whirl okay now then im going to take the round brush and dip it right into a
Bob Ross,little touch of the liquid white just a little touch im going to add the least least little touch of the bright red here the tiniest little bit tap that brush tap it tap it tap it okay lets go up
Bob Ross,here now then lets put some beautiful little highlights up here on these trees just use just the top corner of the brush and begin tapping see there but think about shapes in here dont just throw
Bob Ross,this on at random leave some of those nice dark areas in here see the patterns thats what gives your tree shape and form now if you have trouble making it stick add a little bit more of the liquid
Bob Ross,white to it im gonna put a little more red in there i want to stand out a little oh there we go there we go beautiful you can see that much better i think okay just go right along here and make some
Bob Ross,decisions how many trees how many bushes oops theres one right there see layer that creates depth this is where the little bunny rabbit hides is behind that bush and then up here all winter long the
Bob Ross,little tree urchin stays now i bet you wonder what a tree urchin is thats what i call a little squirrel i have a big walnut tree in my yard and the little squirrels come and they eat the walnuts and
Bob Ross,we have little little power struggles over whos going to get the wall and thats me and a squirrel guess who wins squirrels got a nest full of nuts and i have none just right up here there i got one
Bob Ross,in little rascals that decided he liked my garage better than he did out there in a cold he moved into my garage cant get that little devil out so i put some moth balls in his nest now it stinks
Bob Ross,there now once again while i have this on my brush im going to begin pulling in some basic shapes and im not worried at this point about much of anything except the lay of the lamb just pull it in
Bob Ross,there we go just like so all right now then we can take the old fan brush the old fan brush with a little white on it and we can begin working on some nice shapes and stuff here this is where begin
Bob Ross,laying in the snow and you can go into a tiny little bit of the phthalo blue and add shadows it doesnt matter in fact its desirable if you pick up a little bit of this brown and begin working it in
Bob Ross,here there we go always always paying attention to the lay of the and thank where the light would hit the snow is very really really smooth it has little bumps because theres rocks and stones and all
Bob Ross,kinds of little happy things that are underneath the snow you may not see them but they they cause bumps in the snow okay maybe tell you what lets go right here and push in there theres a happy
Bob Ross,little little grassy area it just runs right down the hill see there just make all kinds of little things happen here all right i like to do these little winter scenes theres a lot of fun a lot of
Bob Ross,fun and theyre easy make you happy okay tell you what ill tell you what maybe years ago old trapper maybe he built him a little little house right there so ill take some some of the van dyke brown
Bob Ross,cut across and get a little roll of paint on my knife there you see right out of the edge is most important its right out on the edge of the knife lets go up here okay maybe the little house lives
Bob Ross,does now right there there it is see paint that little back e first ill tell you what put a front on him front front on the other side so just sort of in your mind think think what a house looks like
Bob Ross,and he needs a little side over here too boy all right now then take a little white a little brown pull it out very flat get us a little roll of paint and lets lets put the least little touch of
Bob Ross,highlight on there barely touching barely touching just caress the canvas okay now see we can see that the light is coming from here so this side is going to be a brighter this one over here this
Bob Ross,ones going to be almost dark almost pure brown dont worry about too much color over that side boy that guy lives in there is freezing because there is no roof on his house lets give him a roof
Bob Ross,lets give him a roof there we go just that easy now hes got a half a roof lets feel sorry for him give him the other half dont want him to freeze okay a little snow on the other side just sort of
Bob Ross,bring all that together that easy we got a little cabin need a door i dont want him to get locked in there and cant get out all winter there you got a little door take a little white go around the
Bob Ross,edges there making rascal stand down im going to take the small knife now ill put a little window right there just a little blue and white just to give the indication of a happy little window like
Bob Ross,that okay were going to chimney well use a small edge of the small knife again put a little chimney take a little tiniest little touch of the bright red excuse my arm there maybe he dont have his
Bob Ross,fireplace lit a little snow laying up here on his chimney there we go that easy ill tell you what take a little bit of liquid black maybe theres what remains of an old fence and it went right on off
Bob Ross,here this is just straight liquid black there it goes there and theres a fuel rails left on it right off into the distance and then neat wash the brush now take a little bit of the liquid white oh
Bob Ross,look at there a little snow laying up here on his fence and a little up here on top there see and you just make all kinds of little things all right now we take the fan brush and grab just a touch of
Bob Ross,that and blend it in all right now we can fix up the foot of this cabin take and work on your perspective look at there you can just cut it right off wherever you want it wherever you want it a little
Bob Ross,white little touch of blue into it and come right along here and theres a big old bunch of snow laying right along in there maybe even creepy the illusion hes been walking right here im just using
Bob Ross,a little little tiny tiny bit of phthalo blue and white and we go back to her pinker colors its got a little peak in there and begin building all this in still paying very close attention to the lay
Bob Ross,of the land its most most important that you always keep in mind the way you want this land to flow if you dont itll get away from you run right out of your painting pretty soon youll have land
Bob Ross,going in every which direction so pay attention to that thats its important so little details that make you make your paintings better make you happier and when you get done with your painting its
Bob Ross,nice to step back and look at it and feel good about it you want to feel good about it there just put that right back in see better get a little larger down here because perspective wise its getting
Bob Ross,closer to you all right all right one side done here isnt that fun there okay lets get serious lets get serious find my round brush here lets put something over here on the other side and have
Bob Ross,some fun back into my dark sienna van dyke brown tap thatll brush in there so you really beat that son of a gun this is where you take out all your frustrations this is better than kicking your dog
Bob Ross,of course hes like mine you kick him hell take your leg off there we go right on up there work it up see once again were starting from the bottom and working upward so its darker to bottom than it
Bob Ross,is on top maybe that comes right up into there i like these very soft earth tones these browns and stuff theyre so striking so effective there we go maybe two its about right there right there tell
Bob Ross,you what lets do we got this whole brush going to so much fun lets go right over on this side and maybe right here im just going to push upward see just push look at all the thousands of little
Bob Ross,little leaves and stuff it makes there isnt that easy it looks like oh dead bush theres one right there too well have a couple of these little rascals just drop them in wherever you want them then
Bob Ross,you take a the old fan brush and go right back in here and begin working some of these out create all kinds of pretty things so you can make make the lay of the land go anywhere you want to go just
Bob Ross,wherever there we go see it makes all kinds of little snow drifts up there there we are sometimes its just so pretty it hurts okay and lets lets change lets change the flow of the land here the
Bob Ross,layout watch right here see take it this way and bring it up in here and automatically grab some of that brown pull it down in there automatically you can change the lay of the lamp so now it you can
Bob Ross,see theres a separate entity here goes back father pushes everything back there we go okay okay now then lets take ill use the old knife here lets just put a quick little indication here of a
Bob Ross,little tree trunk in here just like that a few little limbs here and there a little brown and white a little highlight just a tiny touch of highlight you take just a pointed knife look at there scrape
Bob Ross,through and make all kinds of little doers in there little films and stems and twigs its that easy okay now then lets find thats fine there it is the round brush lets have some fun lets get crazy
Bob Ross,here im going to take a little the bright red a little yellow ochre a little indian yellow but very small amount dont get too wild on this very small amount okay lets go right up here maybe this
Bob Ross,tree here has got a little bit of color on it still from fall just drop in some happy little things once again worry about patterns shapes think about limbs in there and im just using the very top
Bob Ross,corner of the brush just a very very top corner look at that though see all the little things and this creates a little warmth in the painting sometimes i paint winter scenes that are so cold gosh you
Bob Ross,almost have to put on a coat to look at them these are very warm and very soft and they go well in peoples homes people like these kind of paintings these are the type paintings i do for special
Bob Ross,friends and as gifts for christmas and birthdays and weddings and all kinds of things like that you know that brings up another thing a lot of people ask us what we do with all these paintings that we
Bob Ross,do on tv uh most of them are used to go into the books that we do but all the rest of them we donate we donate them to pbs stations all around the country into charity organizations for them to make a
Bob Ross,happy buck with so if you would like to have one one of the easiest ways to get it is to call your pbs station and say hey you know get one of bobs paintings for your next auction and well be glad

Bob Ross,maybe theres still one oh one old post thats hanging across there just like that that easy okay lets have some fun let me get an old fan brush here go right into the van dyck brown little dark
Bob Ross,sienna i think uh yep look at that big old tree big old tree i put a big tree in a painting one time the lady screamed at me absolutely screamed at me so if you dont want a big tree in your painting
Bob Ross,dont put one in there and then scream at me this is your world so you do whatever you want in your painting okay now then ill take the liner brush a little bit of liquid black and well just put the
Bob Ross,indication of a fuel limbs here and there now sometimes i add a little paint thinner to the liquid black to make it really flow easy just let it go just let it really work right off your brush come
Bob Ross,right on around there look at there see and have some of these limbs that go up and across the tree dont have them all just going out the side see and you can put all kinds of little tiny things in
Bob Ross,there just by stroking the canvas can you see that just get sort of crazy and let them go there and then im going to take the knife and a little bit of white brown lets put a little touch of
Bob Ross,highlight on this tree there just barely touch give it a little pull just let the paint grab this is a thick thick paint so itll grab and hang on there maybe this one comes right down in front okay
Bob Ross,see there you can just make all the trees you want in your world okay now then take the old fan brush and put a little snow down here on his foots gotta take care of his old foots bigfoots take the
Bob Ross,liner brush with a little liquid white and just lay on a little highlight here and there to create the illusion of a little snow and i think with that we dont have a finished painting so lets take a
Bob Ross,little bit of the bright red liner brush and well sign this one the old clock on the wall tells me i got to leave you for today but ill be back next time i hope you have your easel set up class of t
Bob Ross,youre all ready until then happy painting god bless you
Bob Ross,welcome back im glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic little painting with me got your palette all set up youre ready to go good tell you what lets have them run all the colors
Bob Ross,across the screen that you need to do the painting that were going to do today and theyll come across in exactly the same order as i have on my palette starting with the white and coming all the way
Bob Ross,around and while theyre doing that lets go up here and get started now ive already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of liquid white its wet and slick and its all ready to go so today
Bob Ross,lets just have some fun im going to start out with a small amount of indian yellow tiniest little bit just tap a little bit onto the brush lets go right up in here in the sky and just let a little
Bob Ross,tiny bit of that play around just here and there put that in first just just little spots of it maybe a little down here im gonna have a little water in this painting so well put a little tiny bit
Bob Ross,right in there then without cleaning the brush im gonna go right into a small amount of alizarin crimson just tap the brush and leave that indian yellow in the brush it makes a pretty color okay
Bob Ross,lets go back up here now then im just going to bounce a little bit of this crimson here and there just sort of play it around let it have fun and there we go nice warm little sky happy little sky
Bob Ross,little over in here all kinds of pretty little cutters that looks good enough to eat and well put just a touch in the water since we know theres going to be some water in here just like so okay now
Bob Ross,then without cleaning the brush again ill go right into a little bit of the midnight black and the small amount of phthalo blue blue and black just a small amount this black is so strong okay lets
Bob Ross,go back up here now then in the sky thats remaining lets just sort of dance in a little bit of this blue black color just let it bounce around and play just here and there okay wherever you think
Bob Ross,your door to be thats exactly where it should be use that same color blue and black and lets finish up our water area now water unless its moving is always flat its level so try to keep these
Bob Ross,strokes as straight as possible itll make itll make your water look better now very quickly this blue and black mixture is so strong itll eat up this little light area so try not to cover that up
Bob Ross,well save a little touch of that thatll be pretty when its all done okay let me wash my old brush here and if youve painted with me before you know this is the fun part shake it off and then that
Bob Ross,really is the fun part okay lets go back up here be sure your brush is clean and dry and im going to very gently using little crisscross patterns just blend all this together now when youre
Bob Ross,painting it at home you paint as soft as you want it the more you blend it the softer itll become itll just absolutely all blend together there we go just let your imagination take you wherever you
Bob Ross,want to be you know one of the letters questions i get in letters all the time is where do we get all the ideas for the paintings that we do you know one of the best ways we have of coming up with
Bob Ross,ideas is from cards people send us we get cards from fantastic people all over the country and they tell us what they want to see a lot of them send oh postcards or photographs and believe it or not
Bob Ross,thats where the majority of these paintings come from okay and that quick we have a very colorful nice little sky lets have some fun lets take the old round brush im going to go into a little bit
Bob Ross,of van dyke brown a little bit of the sienna touches sap green and we just mix them together on the brush tap that brush okay lets go right back up here i want to have some happy little bushes back
Bob Ross,here and im just barely tapping the canvas not tapping very hard and i want them to get lighter toward the top just make a decision what you think your bushes are to look like and drop them in okay a
Bob Ross,little bit more paint this is dark sienna van dyke brown a little bit of sap green i dont want too much green i want to stay sort of in the in the brownish tones there we go you can take alizarin
Bob Ross,crimson and sap green and mix together and make a beautiful brown color maybe theres some little things that live right up in here just wherever you want and if you want to show some things that are
Bob Ross,far far away then just barely touch a canvas so theres just little tiny indications see it looks like little distant distant things far far back in the distance barely barely touching the canvas
Bob Ross,three hairs and some air okay now then lets put a few little highlights on there well take the same old brush just leave it dirty use a little bit of the yellows a little green and just tap it see
Bob Ross,just tap right into it okay now then just using the top corner of the brush begin laying in a few little basic shapes and sort of vary the colors between all the different yellows just barely touching
Bob Ross,the canvas yellow ochre indian yellow cad yellow all these colors you if you have trouble making them stick at least a little touch of the liquid white or a little bit of thinner to your brush tiniest
Bob Ross,little bit tiny little bit just enough so it sticks there we go okay and leave these at a far far away with nothing on them because theyre too far away to see any highlights on them dont dont kill
Bob Ross,everything with highlights youll learn the illusion of distance in your painting okay now then maybe you want to create the idea of mist just floating around here watch right here just take the big
Bob Ross,brush and gently tap right on the base of it round the bottom just tap it now avoid taking the brush like this and hitting it itll cut it off real straight and looks like somebody took a big knife
Bob Ross,and just cut off all the trees you want this line to be very soft and varied you dont want you dont want a distinct line across there and you can very lightly very lightly just lift upward a little
Bob Ross,bit lets see and that easy you have the illusion of mist just floating all down at the bottom of that okay i use the same old dirty brush go right into the browns this is the dark sienna and the van
Bob Ross,dyke lets go right back up here maybe theres a happy little hill right here now we dont want to kill all that misty area that we put right in here that misty area is what separates what divides
Bob Ross,okay all were doing now is putting down a base color so our next color will show up you need the dark in order for light to show you knew that all right while i have this color on my brush im gonna
Bob Ross,pull a tiny bit of it down this will create the illusion of a reflection straight down be sure it goes straight down just like that and then very lightly across and it gives you the indication of
Bob Ross,water that easy now same old brush hadnt cleaned it yet going right into some of the yellows and the green and just tap that brush and see tap it like that all right come on back up here lets come
Bob Ross,right in here and drop in some highlights right on top of that dark and just like before if you have problems making it stick add a little bit of the liquid white or a little bit of thinner then paint
Bob Ross,will stick to a thick paint and the base colors that we use are very very firm and here and there you can even take a little bit of the red color look at there isnt that pretty and just drop in a few
Bob Ross,little things like that im going to put the tiniest amount of thinner on the brush see how much easier it sticks even though my yellows are a little bit thinner than the other colors sometimes when
Bob Ross,you have several layers you want it really thin so to stick right up there okay that gives us a nice little background to play with and if you wanted to you could even pull a tiny bit of that
Bob Ross,highlight color right down into the reflections like so and ill use it another brush this ones clean and pull it down this is a clean dry brush and go across see how it reflects all those colors
Bob Ross,right into the reflections all right now lets take the knife and ill use a little bit of brown here a little bit of the van dyke brown pull that paint out as flat as you can get it and then just cut
Bob Ross,across so you have that little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife yes go up here now then im just gonna put just by rubbing it back and forth put the indication a little bit of land
Bob Ross,back here i need something for all these little grassy things to set on dont want to fall off in the water to make a big splash there there we go and you can take that same brown add a little
Bob Ross,titanium white to it and with that make a little touch of highlight color just like so okay let me take a little the liquid white pull it out very flat okay then cut across it can you see that see cut
Bob Ross,across that gives you a little tiny roll of paint right on the knife blade lets go up here now then go straight into the canvas and act like youre trying to saw a hole in it just really get tough
Bob Ross,with it and that cleans up the bottom of your land puts a little water line there and creates once again the illusion of distance in your painting keep these lines basically straight you dont want
Bob Ross,your water to run out on your carpet all right now we can take a clean knife and just scrape in the indication of a few little trunks and twigs and little things like that here and there no big deal
Bob Ross,wherever you want okay time to have some fun here lets go back to our round brush im gonna go right back into the browns this is a dark sienna the van dyke brown a little bit of the sap green well
Bob Ross,throw in there too really tap that brush firmly were gonna get it loaded up okay lets go up here now then maybe yep there is now im really really hitting the canvas quite hard you can probably see
Bob Ross,it bending im hitting it so hard there really suck it in there maybe theres a huge yeah lets have a big tree that lives right here and he just hangs right out over like that look at that look at
Bob Ross,that maybe right on up out here wherever you make a decision wherever you want your tree to live thats where he lives trees are one of my favorite things to paint i think youre so beautiful okay
Bob Ross,lets really get crazy today maybe yep maybe theres a happy bush that lives right there and hes got a friend named clyde that lives right there so you make up little stories when you paint it it
Bob Ross,really helps you dont have to be crazy to do this but its it does help there see when you put on your painters suit you can get away with anything because everybody thinks those painters you know
Bob Ross,are a little weird so we could we can do anything and in your painting you paint things that make you happy you create your own visions your own world a lot of a lot of the letters that ive received
Bob Ross,people want to know what did i do before i became a painter and i spent half my life in the military i worked in i worked in the hospital in the military and i would come home from work and i would
Bob Ross,paint for over 20 years i would do that id come home and paint because on this canvas oh in this canvas i could have total freedom nobody told me what time to be at work and what kind of world to
Bob Ross,make here i could make any kind of world that i wanted any kind of world lets put a big tree right here sometimes i talk too much when i should be painting there we go but being in the military for
Bob Ross,half my life allowed me to see parts of the world that i would have never seen all the way to southeast asia and back and it introduced me to my favorite place in the world and alaska has some of the
Bob Ross,most beautiful scenery if you ever get a chance to go there if you havent been you really should take a trip youll see where a lot of the scenery that i paint comes from and he may be like me and
Bob Ross,wont leave i just bought a house and stayed there okay there we go well im sitting here talking so much about covered up the whole canvas so why dont we lets just go ahead and fill all this in
Bob Ross,sometimes i get carried away as i say when im talking i dont know when to stop okay and this is still just the dark sienna van dyke brown and a little tiny touch of sap green not much green and when
Bob Ross,youre using a brush this big it didnt take but a few minutes just to cover it all up but you can also begin laying in some basic shapes and some basic ideas you can see them all in here and at this
Bob Ross,point youre not committed because you could put this part on well in all honesty you put it on with a paint roller we might have a whole new way of painting if we did that okay now you can sort of
Bob Ross,look at the shape of some of these trees im gonna i think ill make this one a little bigger shoot weve covered up most of the canvas already why not just keep going with it there we go all that
Bob Ross,beautiful background we worked so hard and we just covered it up lets take an old fan brush and im going to go right in to the van dyck brown load that brush full of paint both sides okay now watch
Bob Ross,im going to take one side and go through white see went through both sides with van dyke brown and then one side with white so ive got white on one side brown on the other there we go lets go up
Bob Ross,here now then lets take and right here touch and give it a little pull and by double loading the brush we have both sides of the tree trunk at one time sneaky huh look at that and then pretty and
Bob Ross,its easy to do fun to do cant tell you what lets put a trunk right here in this old tree we cant have him without a nice strong trunk and when youre doing these trunks all trees dont become
Bob Ross,telephone poles so make some of them with little crooks and bins and it makes your painting more interesting see put little little little bends in it really really will brighten up your painting make
Bob Ross,it look more natural spend some time looking at trees you know i go out in the woods and i hunt with a camera well i just shoot them dead with a camera and then you save these photographs and you can
Bob Ross,take a tree out of one photograph and maybe put it with another photograph that has a beautiful sky you can combine these things okay im going to take a little bit of paint then go right into some
Bob Ross,bright red right on the liner brush just turn it okay lets go right back up here maybe on this tree im going to take a little bit of this red and just come right down the edge now very gently just
Bob Ross,blend that out see another make a pretty little tree its easy there we go there we go right down the side of this one and just blend it out and if you wanted to you could add a little bit over here
Bob Ross,just just here and there wherever you want it wherever you want sometimes you can take just a little bit of the liquid white lets do a little different here you take a little liquid white and come
Bob Ross,right down the side and then blend it in so its bright on that far edge and softer as it goes toward the center of the trunk and that gives you the indication of roundness in your tree trunk see you
Bob Ross,just blend it to whatever degree of softness that you want that easy or you can just take plain liquid white and here and there put an old white trunk you know theres theres trees that have white
Bob Ross,bark on them and theyre pretty everythings pretty happy little tree there we go okay now then a little bit of the liquid black on the liner brush and lets make the indication of a little branch
Bob Ross,here and there just here and there this is just straight liquid black there all kinds of little things okay that gives you an idea how to do that now get the old round brush im going to add a little
Bob Ross,bit of liquid white to it this is the same old dirty brush because i want the colors to be soft and muted so so that ive left all the browns on there im going right into the yellows now and i added
Bob Ross,a small amount of the liquid white just to thin the paint okay lets go back up here now then lets make some decisions using just the top of the brush just the top and just touch try not to hit the
Bob Ross,same area over and over or pretty soon youll become a mud mixer and if youve painted before weve all experienced a little bit of mud mixing try to avoid that and here just worry about some basic
Bob Ross,shapes im just barely tapping just barely touching dont have to hit hard dont have to hit him hard just enough to get the paint to come off the brush see another super nice easy way to put all
Bob Ross,those little leaves and stuff on the tree all right okay add a little bit of bright red to that might as well get crazy im still just tapping lets go right up here maybe these over here maybe old
Bob Ross,jack frost has touched them a little bit youre beginning to see a little color and this is your creation so whatever color you want them to be look at that once again remember your little patterns in
Bob Ross,here dont just dont just throw this on at random think like a tree think like a tree there okay just work on these little patterns create all kinds of happy little little things in here and dont
Bob Ross,kill all the darks you need those darks okay lets go over to this other tree this one on the far right dont want him to feel left out well give him a few happy little leaves up here thats a nice
Bob Ross,one that one really really worked nice and when you paint sometimes a brush just hits right and things oh they sparkle they sparkle thats one of our happy accidents we like those look at that though
Bob Ross,i used to spend weeks with a one-haired brush trying to do all this now im lazy okay okay lets take oh i see another bush right here now you can begin just picking out little individuals just pick
Bob Ross,them out let them go wherever wherever you want theres one its got looks like little flowers on it i tell you what you want lets take the fan brush and it has brown on it still i want a happy
Bob Ross,little path it goes right back in here youd have to have a way of getting back in here and catching that big trout that lives right over in there so well just put some brown on first then ill just
Bob Ross,use the same old dirty brush ill take some dark sienna and some white just mix it loosely on the brush now just barely touching the canvas just let it sort of graze across there and wiggle it make it
Bob Ross,look like little stones theyre sitting this isnt a big paved highway here this has got little stones and rocks and so its not real even just let it disappear right on into the background like so
Bob Ross,okay lets have some fun im gonna take the two inch brush and go right into the same colors that ive been using the yellows thats all the yellows all the reds just bring them together now then
Bob Ross,lets begin making the indication of little grassy things that are growing right up to the path here work in layers do the area thats a farthest away first and work forward always working forward
Bob Ross,forward forward and make little individual things just dont just dont throw them in there at random see you could even make your bush right here see just like so dont paint all of them leave some
Bob Ross,of them dark okay okay here just gonna add a little more green to that this whole big brush you can just tap in all kinds of beautiful beautiful little highlights like so working layers i cant say
Bob Ross,that enough cant say that enough all kinds of little hills isnt that super i think were light with strike seeing the lights coming through there and just zinging here and there and if you think
Bob Ross,lights really going to strike here you can add a little white and really make it look like lights just coming right through there okay lets go over here on this other side and put in some happy
Bob Ross,little things right there like that always paying attention to the lay of the land there we go nice bright one right there it stands out makes it look like a little rounded area and that helps push
Bob Ross,that path all the way back up in there okay im going back to my fan brush it has the brown on it ill tell you what lets get brave right here right here zoom theres a big old tree and hes got a
Bob Ross,friend right there dont even get lonely well give them a friend see that that helps push the whole path area back further into the painting im going to take a little bright red a little white and
Bob Ross,brown and mix it together here and lets just put the indication of some highlight right here make this tree stand out we want him to really shine in the sunlight there just put a little highlight on
Bob Ross,him all right on up wherever you want it im gonna use a little bit of the brown on the other side just to make it dark dark dark over here see that sort of makes that tree look round okay our liner
Bob Ross,brush with some of the liquid black and that quick that quick gives us some happy little tree limbs see and as many as you want this is your tree so you just put them where you want them and however
Bob Ross,many you want there we go now we have the indication of a few branches there lets take the old big brush well go right into some sap green and some of the yellows and lets go right up here and then
Bob Ross,you can put the indication of some nice little nice little leaves that live right out here just like so look at there and thats all there is to it just drop them in and the old clock on the wall
Bob Ross,tells me its its time to sneak out of here for this week so with that i think well call this painting finished i look forward to seeing you again happy painting god bless hmm you
Bob Ross,Music hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me again today got your pette set up lets get going here lets start off and having them graphically run all the colors across the screen that
Bob Ross,you need to do this painting with me and theyll come across as usual in the same order that I have them on the pallet starting with the white and working around while theyre doing that lets go on
Bob Ross,up here Ive already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of liquid white its nice and wet and slick and all ready to go I thought maybe today lets do a little fall scene where maybe the weather
Bob Ross,is not too great you know in the fall we have a lot of rainy weather and the you know the snow is going to come pretty soon so lets do something like that and just just have some fun Im going to
Bob Ross,start out using a small small amount of yellow ochre just the tiniest little bit very small amount and right here sort of make a determination where The Horizons going to be and Im going to begin
Bob Ross,swinging this upward just using Strokes like so little bit more color well have a little water in this pain as you know Im Im sort of a water fanatic like that water a little yellow in here okay
Bob Ross,Im going to go right into some van Dy Brown in the same way just tap the brush into it okay lets go right up here and Im going put a little brown right in here Im beginning to create these sky
Bob Ross,angles dont let them get too too straight like this itll itll disturb you when its done now Im going to take Brown and a touch of Prussian Blue let me say that again a touch Prussian Blue is so
Bob Ross,strong just a little bit just brown and blue okay now that just begin bringing that all together add a touch of the midnight black to it so now we have in the sky we have a little bit of yellow ochre
Bob Ross,some brown little pressing blue and some midnight black and were just going to sort of work all these nice little colors together try to keep the blue off that yellow or youll get a bright green Sky
Bob Ross,okay and then before we start blending that we still have a dirty old brush and well take some more of the Prussian Blue and a little bit of the black there we go and lets go ahead and lay our water
Bob Ross,in pull from the outside in see if you start if you start from here and go across Watch What Happens you touch here and go across you get this big line thats bad and then its hard to blend out so
Bob Ross,start from the outside and come over and that way you dont have that harsh line that you have to blend out there we go little tricks like that save you save you a lot of Agony we want this to be easy
Bob Ross,and we want it to work for you okay a little bit more of the midnight black impression blue mixture dont want to kill all that nice little yellow area that you have cuz that blue and black will eat
Bob Ross,it up in a heartbeat okay A little darker at the bottom than there at the top thatll help create your illusion of distance okay let me wash the old brush wash the old brush shake off the excess that
Bob Ross,is the fun part okay lets go right back up here and Im going to begin blending This Together follow the angles in the sky Im going to use long strokes and start in the light area and work up toward
Bob Ross,the darker area that way your brush is dirty when it gets to the top use your clean brush in the light area and you can just begin bringing all this together all of those angles though there we go
Bob Ross,its nice and soft okay and that gives us a quick happy little Sky down here we just go all the way across that straightens out the water and brings it all together and were ready let me get an old
Bob Ross,fan brush here Im going to mix up lets take a little black a little brown tiny bit of the Prussian Blue and a little bit of a lizard and Crimson into that Im put some white here and pull a little
Bob Ross,bit of that into it maybe Ill add a little more blue to that and touch more Crimson there we go thats sort of what Im looking for its a very dark lavender to the blue side its very dark its
Bob Ross,almost a gray color this is going to be a gray cloudy day okay let me wipe off my knife now lets take the old fan brush and go right through a little bit of color dont need a lot of paint on the
Bob Ross,brush this time just a little add a small amount a brown into that a little little more into the brownish color there we go good lets go right up here now back in here you have to make a decision
Bob Ross,maybe there lives some happy little Evergreens just take the corner of the brush just back and forth just sort of pop in just a little Evergreen and some indications of some that are even farther away
Bob Ross,all we see is just the basic shapes Im just touching and sort of pulling it downward see you make all kinds of little basic shapes see touch use the top part of the brush and just give it a little
Bob Ross,downward snap there put a little more paint on the brush maybe over here we got some be careful these will get looking like fence posts there and to about there thats good enough now then Im going
Bob Ross,to put a few more indication of some trees that have a little more shape to them and we just using the corner of the brush and just work them in back and forth these little trees live right in your
Bob Ross,fan brush sometimes you have to sort of scare them out there and you just put as many or as few as you want in your world there we go okay maybe hes got a little friend there just drop them in now
Bob Ross,then I want to create the illusion of mist back here I want this to be very soft and very distant so well take the 2-in brush and tap Im using the top corner see look how hard its hitting its
Bob Ross,bending really get in here and tap it tap it tap it see then you can create the illusion of a very very soft area back here you can even let it come up above some of these here to really soften it see
Bob Ross,these trees are already theyre already just lost right in the Mist okay can you believe how that pushes all that back just that little tapping action okay now then lets lets have another plane in
Bob Ross,the painting and a plane I mean just another area thats closer to you so well take those same old colors well use some brown Im going to put some dark Sienna in there this time and a little bit of
Bob Ross,sap green as things get closer well begin to see a little more detail just a little sap green though okay brush is really full of paint lets go right up in here there it is these trees are a little
Bob Ross,closer theyre a little bit bigger look at that turn that old brush over and use both sides of it there we go this tree is stronger hes he got a little more light there okay we dont want him to get
Bob Ross,lonely so well give him a friend too you know friends are so important not only the trees but to us and through painting I have made oh Ive made hundreds and hundreds of new friends all over the
Bob Ross,country and that may be the most rewarding part of all this most rewarding part there I tell you what heres a happy little tree he lives right there just sort of just sort of visualize in your mind
Bob Ross,where you think Tri tree would be happy and you put him in there just put him in there take a little bit of the dark Sienna and just tap it onto this brush and then I want to gather up some of this
Bob Ross,color that we had on a tree and begin very softly putting in little Hills look at there see pick up some of that tree color and just let it just tap just let it go there was a tiny bit of dark Sienna
Bob Ross,on the brush tiny bit tiniest little bit see how you can set those trees right up on a little Hill and then you begin pulling it down but I want this to be very very soft very quiet I like very gentle
Bob Ross,little paintings and when youre doing yours at home if you want it to be brighter and stronger just use a little stronger color cuz painting is a very individual thing there okay now lets go right
Bob Ross,back into here and load up just load that fan brush full of paint okay tell you what Lets do lets have a tree that lives right there and we take just the corner of the brush and begin working him
Bob Ross,down so you can just push that old tree right out of that brush little more paint just push it hard when you get down this far when you first start youre pushing quite easy by the time you get down
Bob Ross,here getting tough with it strong with it little more color okay I tell you what this do right here big son of a gun see all these different sizes of trees help create the illusion of distance depth
Bob Ross,in your painting there we go is that beginning to look like fall yet so s of a mean old Sky there okay now then Im going to go back into a little tiny tiny little bit of the dark Sienna tiny cant
Bob Ross,say that enough times and Im going to create another plane here and Im going to pick up some of the tree color see how that and all Im doing is just tapping the canvas just tap and well bring it
Bob Ross,right on across add the least little touch more of the Sienna look at there see it creates a whole another plane and pushes all those trees back here back into the distance isnt that super now Im
Bob Ross,going to have water here so lets take a little bit of that color and just pull it down so we have a little reflection Im using just a little bit of the dark sand and a little van Dy Brown on the
Bob Ross,brush to pull down and create a reflection here just a just a happy little reflection like right there right there and then lightly go across okay now then Im going to take the same old brush without
Bob Ross,cleaning it just same old dirty brush and tap right into a little bit of the yellow ochre and the bright red just tap it gently see just tap okay now then here this is a Little Closer so were
Bob Ross,beginning to see an indication of some highlights and same way just gently gently tapping that was bright red and a tiniest little touch of yellow ochre now the red is very strong be careful with it
Bob Ross,be careful with it itll eat up your whole world in just a second take a little brown little dark Sienna mix together pull it out cut across get that small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife
Bob Ross,okay now then just a little land indication right in there just like so just sort of scrubbing across the canvas tiniest little bit add a little white to that same color like that and then just
Bob Ross,indication of a touch of highlight here I dont I dont want much highlight in this just a touch here and there okay little bit of the liquid white cut across it and well put just an indication of a
Bob Ross,little water line not too much not too bright okay now then go back into my Browns sien and the van Dy and Im going to grab some more of this tree color Im going to put a little Peninsula I think it
Bob Ross,comes right out here and when youre doing this just step back look at your painting and make make decisions just make decisions pull a little bit of this color down just a little go gently gently
Bob Ross,across now same old dirty brush back into my yellow Och and bright red mixture just a little same old dirty brush you you can get over here and a little bit of this CAD yellow too its all right now
Bob Ross,then see follow the angles of the land the lay of the land just follow it right on down brighter on top and then darker darker darker as it works down if you want to show a a little protrusion here
Bob Ross,see see easy that is creates the illusion of another little Hill just by changing the value of the color or the intensity little bit of that right down to the water go across and you have instant
Bob Ross,Reflections lets play a little bit over here tell you what lets do Im going to use a round brush and go right into my Browns thats the Sienna and the Van Dyke tap out the excess lets go up here
Bob Ross,maybe back in here theres some happy little trees maybe maybe these are little birch trees that live way back in the distance just put some little indications like so like so use the old scrip liner
Bob Ross,brush just take it little paint thinner on it go right into the Brown Turn it bring it to a sharp Point lets put just a few basic very basic indications of a tree branch here and there little tree
Bob Ross,trunk not looking for a lot of detail same old dirty brush now go into a small small amount of the yellow ochre and the bright red smallest little amount Im just barely touching then I want to just
Bob Ross,touch right up the top here put some indications begin forming some basic little patterns some little shapes into your trees dont just throw these on at random I know I say that in every show but I
Bob Ross,get the most letters about that is that my my tree shapes dont look right and thats normally normally the problem 99 of the time the problem is is a color is just throwed on at random sort of look
Bob Ross,at it practice it a little bit of practice here will pay you tremendous dividends tremendous dividends just a few little bushes and all kinds of things okay tell you what go into a little brown lets
Bob Ross,put a little land area right there see just right there right there okay A little bit of that highlight color thats just a little brown and white not too much just a little here little bit of the
Bob Ross,liquid white cut us in a little water line Im going right back into the Browns I have yet to wash this brush Ive been going back and forth between the Browns and the highlight colors and now Im
Bob Ross,going to put another little Peninsula that lives right there so you dont care if the bottom of it sort of comes down because you just pull that down that easy that easy makes little Reflections and
Bob Ross,then lightly lightly go across go right into our color yellow ochre bright red little Indian yellow here and there and little C yellow and put a few little highlights on it okay there see and you can

Bob Ross,painting clouds like this work in layers do the most distant layer first and then come forward always working forward a little more of the red into the white and maybe yep look at here theres another
Bob Ross,happy little cloud and he lives right there wherever you think a cloud ought to live thats where he should live tell you what maybe theres one that lives right here and he just floats right down
Bob Ross,clouds are very free theyre one of the freest things in nature they just float around and have a good time there we go top corner of a large brush tiniest little circles and give it a little fluff
Bob Ross,there just fluff it up remember years ago ladies used to tease your hair like this same principle you just sort of fluff it up tease it just tease it and then very gently blend the entire sky isnt
Bob Ross,that a fantastic way to make some great big billowing clouds works very well lets put some big mountains in this one Im going to take some black some blue and some lizard Crimson some Liz Crimson
Bob Ross,now if you want to see what color you have take a little white and put there cuz that just looks black see and there you can tell I want a little more Crimson I want it a little bit more into the
Bob Ross,purplish Hue thats better okay okay pull it out flat cut off a little roll of paint okay lets go up here now have to make a big decision where does your big mountain live I think he lives right
Bob Ross,there see when you put this lavender color over the yellow you can get away with it because when you mix lavender and yellow it makes a nice Brown and you dont care if you got brown in your mountains
Bob Ross,if you used Too Much blue youd have Green Mountains thatd be all right but this looks a little better for what were looking for today there we go and the only thing youre worried about is a nice
Bob Ross,top Edge you could really care less whats happening in here now then lets take the old Big Brush and very gently pull this down well have a ridge of mountains today I like to do those so just sort
Bob Ross,of pull it right down like this and this is where you begin laying out your basic Mountain shapes and angles just like that just using brush Strokes like that there there all right you know when you
Bob Ross,paint every day is a good day when you paint every day is a good day I had somebody tell me here a while back he said how can every day be a a good day this you know this just every day cant be a
Bob Ross,good day if you dont think everyday is a good day try missing a few youll see all right lets go up here and play take some white little bit of a lizard and crimson and the least little touch of the
Bob Ross,phthalo blue into it I want a a lavender color but more into the reddish Hue than than what we put on there to start with cut off a tiny tiny little bit see there little bitty roll lets go right up
Bob Ross,here now then begin picking out your highlights and just let that barely touch the canvas just barely its just just grazing the canvas as Ive said on some of the earlier shows in the series when I
Bob Ross,was teaching my son to paint I used to tell him just just to pretend he was a whisper floating across the mountain just graze the canvas caress it make love to the canvas very gentle very soft see and
Bob Ross,then we can take lets take some of the color that we made the mountain with and add a little white to that we want it dark darker than the Highlight but lighter than what we have up here already and
Bob Ross,now lets just begin tapping some of these together just begin working them together pay very close attention to the angles the angles are the secret see and not much paint the smallest smallest
Bob Ross,amount of paint possible just put all these little Shadow areas in here virtually no paint okay Im going to take some crimson and white and make a a nice warm pinkish color and with that lets go up
Bob Ross,here with that well really put some shiny little highlights on here isint that pretty see how it stands out and you can put layer after layer after layer of highlights on here just as many as you
Bob Ross,want in your world just sort of let them all come together put little bumps in it think about all the little rocks that live up here maybe that comes right down see just let your imagination go
Bob Ross,theres look at that look at that but its that easy to do just think where the light would strike through here just so let all these things blend together layer after layer after layer then you go
Bob Ross,back in here and put all kinds of little look there see how that just jumps right out that easy and when youre doing this in home this is when that little knife really comes in you can sneak into all
Bob Ross,those little places take a little bit of the phthalo blue tiniest little amount a little white into it there okay lets go back up here and just sort of touch oh look at that look at that see it
Bob Ross,really Sparkles it up right up here on the edge like so okay now then clean dry 2in brush and I want to tap this just tap it we want to diffuse and soften and lift it upward very gently see that
Bob Ross,pushes everything back back makes it so soft and quiet and you just keep going on and on and on maybe maybe theres another big old mountain that lives right here oh let me show you something let me
Bob Ross,show you something thats fun maybe maybe when a cloud floats in here you can just take a little paint and if you keep that brush moving see there put a little cloud in blend it give it a little fluff
Bob Ross,and and thatll look like a nice soft Misty area where theres a little Cloud floating down that mountain okay lets take maybe right there just sort of let your imagination go crazy put these
Bob Ross,wherever you want them each Mountain as you work forward should get darker in value this base color here should get darker and darker really push it into the fabric push hard take the Big Brush pull
Bob Ross,it out a little bit just give it a little pull see when you put this one in there it just set that little Cloud we made right back in there the little Cloud just hides back in there and has fun in
Bob Ross,between those see now lets come right along here and just put the indication of a few little highlights just zinging through there and playing look at that see follow the basic angles in your
Bob Ross,mountains thats most important most important than where the light would strike right there maybe a little bit would go Zing okay put in a few little Shadow indications and just sort of work these
Bob Ross,shadows and highlights together make all kinds of little things things happen here comes one right there right there just back and forth between Shadow and highlight color see how you can set things
Bob Ross,back in there and that creates a little recessed area back in there sneaky huh I like these kind of little things that just happen there we go now once again clean dry brush and very gently very
Bob Ross,gently just tap and lift upward always following the angles its most important that you follow those angles look at that and we have another layer of mountains and you can go on and on and on I show
Bob Ross,you another one here lets take well take a little black and a little blue a little more of the Crimson we just use a fan brush watch here watch here maybe theres a little bump that lives there you
Bob Ross,can do these the fan brush there it is just fill that in maybe it comes we dont care where it goes right on out like that and a little bit of highlight see there just just take the fan brush you can
Bob Ross,almost paint with anything if you just practice enough all you have to do is just practice see put little shadow colors in there here little oh theres a happy little thing just lives there just let
Bob Ross,your imagination go crazy theres a nice little let that fan brush wiggle and play all the little things happen then well take our Big Brush and lets just tap this a little bit just to soften it
Bob Ross,look at there and that easy you have a Little Rock now we have three layers of rocks here mountains and that creates a lot of distance in the painting each layer or each plane that you put in creates
Bob Ross,more and more distance in your painting Im going take a little bit of the same old mountain color and lets maybe theres some happy little things that live back here and just see now were beginning
Bob Ross,to see some little distance trees just sort of touch it give it a little snap upward just got to say those little funny sounds or dont work there we goop all kinds of little things like yeah let me
Bob Ross,just clean the brush off in there cuz all were looking for in here is a good dark color we dont we dont care just a good dark color it should reflect the colors that youve used in the painting
Bob Ross,already thats a good dark color all right let me grab another fan brush here I tell you what tell you what Im going to go right into some liquid white and then right into the titanium white Im
Bob Ross,looking for a paint thats a little bit thinner and I no lets really make it more interesting maybe theres a stone lives right there see Stones need a little place to live to well put a couple
Bob Ross,little Stones there Im going to take a little dark Sienna little white okay cut off a little bit of paint lets go up here and lets just put a little tiny bit of highlight on them Stones we want a
Bob Ross,little Sun playing through here highlight the same side of the stone that you did on the mountain okay now then lets have some water and the waters coming back here its coming back here like so
Bob Ross,maybe it comes right here and goes push now remember we put a little bit of liquid white in with the titanium white we want to thin that down so its thinner than the paint thats already on the
Bob Ross,canvas if its not thinner then youre going to become a Mud Mixer and then youre going to be unhappy with me okay maybe maybe when the water gets here it hits this one and just goes like that and
Bob Ross,splashes over this way now when it hits down here there see got all kinds of happy little splashes just look at that look at that all those little things are happening right there maybe theres a
Bob Ross,little stone that lives under the water there it causes it to go all right lets have some fun tell you what Im going to take the old two-inch brush and go right into oh well take some lizin Crimson
Bob Ross,tiny bit of phthalo blue and a little bit of black okay lets go right up here I think yep lets put a just push and bend that theres a happy little tree that lives right there and we begin worrying
Bob Ross,about the lay of the land and it comes right down in front of of this water there it is just like so okay maybe well just put a whole bunch of stuff right in here what the heck there it is so you put
Bob Ross,your dark in so your light will show little more blue a little more Crimson touch it black I know right there just sort of look at your painting and make big decisions where you think where do you
Bob Ross,think all these little things should live right down like that we dont know we dont have to make these decisions yet well make these decisions as we work on down in the painting okay lets put some
Bob Ross,stones in here take a little van Dy Brown and we need a stone to hold this waterfall back otherwise it just wouldnt stay there by itself water is lazy it looks for the easiest way to get to where
Bob Ross,its going so when youre doing these little waterfalls youve got to have little stones and stuff that explain why the water is higher back here you dont want it to just sort of all of a sudden be
Bob Ross,there one of the basic rules of nature is water will not climb a rock just so itll fall and be pretty for you its lazy its like me looks for the easy way to do things okay lets take our old fan
Bob Ross,brush go right into lets see theres some black blue Crimson Im going to grab a little bit of white so I can lighten that up a little okay lets go back up here a lot of paint on the brush and maybe
Bob Ross,there lives yep right here a happy little tree and this time Im going to push upward push upward with a fan brush normally we push downward when were making the Evergreens we want these to have
Bob Ross,little branches though they go upward see that in some parts of the country that looks more like the trees than in others so sort of look around your house and see what kind of trees you have I know
Bob Ross,Im going to get a letter from somebody they say Bob all I got is a maple tree in my yard well you can put a maple tree in yours there just put these little Rascals wherever you want see these look
Bob Ross,like little Christmas trees to me and Christmas is always a happy time there okay just push upward bend it upward make all these little trees now some of them that are a little closer you might see a
Bob Ross,little highlight so Ill take same old dirty brush go into a little yellow and a little sap green I want this quite dark cuz its far away load it full now then just put in a little indication of some
Bob Ross,green still pushing upward not a whole bunch you dont want to kill all the dark there we go just here and there some of them dont put anything on thatll help save the illusion of distance all right
Bob Ross,lets put some highlights on those bushes well use a 1in brush today go into all the yellows thats yellow ochre C had yellow lets grab some sap green just all of them a little bit of the bright red
Bob Ross,okay lets go right up here maybe this big old tree back here look at this there thousands of little leaves that easy think about the shapes inside of the tree dont dont just hit it random dont hit
Bob Ross,it random okay maybe theres a nice one he lives right there you notice Im still working in layers doing the thing as fathers away first over here theres a nice little yellow bushy he lives right
Bob Ross,there and you can use a brush sideways to create little layers of little soft grassy areas lets take this a little bit of the brown and white we used for highlight and we put a little highlight on
Bob Ross,that rock a little out here Wherever You Got A Little Rock droping a little highlight on it okay going grab some more vany Brown theres a big stones that live just let them sort of wander cuz
Bob Ross,anything that you dont want here you just cover it up you can do anything in here anything on this piece of canvas big old Stones there back to our highlight color and just begin putting some
Bob Ross,highlights on those stones brown and white there we go like so back to our 1in brush some of the yellows and the greens and begin putting in some little bushes in between as I said anything that you
Bob Ross,dont want you just cover it up easy to do see just wherever you want them its go on the other side same thing over here make your little individual bushes one at a time just like so and work in
Bob Ross,layers always working in layers now back to our water liquid White and the titanium white okay now begin splashing some of that water up against these Stones Let It swivel and swirl and have fun just
Bob Ross,sort of think like water just push it up let the splashes hit crash like so there went one see think about all the little little areas underneath the water there we go you know and I say repeatedly
Bob Ross,through these shows just mention it again if theres things that you want to see painted that we havent painted drop me a line I would love to hear from you and this is where most of our ideas come
Bob Ross,from for the paintings that we do just from people all over the country and they write and tell me what they want to see lot of them send pictures and that helps a great deal if I know if I know what
Bob Ross,you want then I can do that for you little Stone there little highlight on it okay back to my 1in brush we loaded full of paint and maybe yep there a happy little Bush he lives right there see and
Bob Ross,this sort of closes all that in you can put little Stones wherever you want them okay then we take a clean knife and just scrape in all kind of little sticks and twigs lets go over here and put some
Bob Ross,on this side too we dont want it left out just like that now then the old clocks tell me I got to get to going here but I want to have some fun before we go lets go into a little a little bit of
Bob Ross,black little bit of black lets go right up here I think in my painting I want a big tree right there theres his trunk theres his trunk and we just push up look at that see put a big old leaves on
Bob Ross,it helps set everything back I like big old trees just pushing in go right into a little tiny bit of yellow and we can highlight it so I say think thatll give you a nice painting to work with well
Bob Ross,call that one finished and from all of us here happy painting God bless Music oh
Bob Ross,Im glad to see you today today I thought wed do the little animated opening the little painting that you see at the beginning of each show so tell you what lets have them put all the colors on the
Bob Ross,screen that you need to do this painting and lets go up here now Ive already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white its wet and slick and its all ready to go so lets go to
Bob Ross,Im going to start out today with a small amount of the Indian yellow tiniest little bit just tapped onto the brush just use a 2in brush lets go right in here put a little tiny tiny bit of yellow
Bob Ross,right along right along where you think the Horizon will be we just drop that in just using little crisscross Strokes maybe Ill put put some down in here this was a little snow scene so well put
Bob Ross,some colors down in the snow that it will be reflected from the sky okay without cleaning the brush Im going to go into a small amount of azarin crimson just a small amount okay then back up here
Bob Ross,right above that yellowish color the Indian yellow still using little crisscross Strokes well just drop in a little little bit of lizin crimson and sort of let them blend together right here where
Bob Ross,they come together all right okay and same color well just put a little bit down in here and what will eventually be snow looks pretty already okay and without cleaning the brush Im going right into
Bob Ross,some of the midnight black just a very small amount and a little bit of phthalo blue tiniest little bit its a very strong color both of these colors are very strong so dont get carried away and
Bob Ross,overdue its real easy to add more color to your sky but its a son of a going to try to take it away still using little crisscross patterns little Xs well just just lay in some little Sky shapes
Bob Ross,just sort of let them happen a little bit more right in there and you can just bring them have some little arms coming out here wherever wherever and you can put a little bit of that color down in
Bob Ross,here just here and there doesnt matter at this point this is really just a good way of cleaning the brush and speaking of cleaning the brush lets do that shake off the excess that really is a fun
Bob Ross,part all right lets go up here now clean dry brush and be very sure that your brush is dry as you can possibly get it and then still using the little crisscross Strokes blend this entire Sky together
Bob Ross,very gently and thats how the little sky is made its a very effective little Sky very quick very easy and its a nice little Sky okay now then we want some little footy heels back here in the
Bob Ross,background so to make those Im going right back into the midnight black a little bit of the blue Im going to reach over here and pick up a small amount of white titanium white so we have black blue
Bob Ross,and white okay and Im just tapping that brush right into it okay lets go back up here make a big decision here wheres your Foothill live I think he is right there use just the corner of the brush
Bob Ross,touch and pull it straight down and lay in your basic Foothill shapes just sort of let them wander around you dont want them to be real straight Foothills normally normally have little high points
Bob Ross,and low points all kinds of happy little things that happen in there straight straight down were not using much pressure on the brush here just enough to get the paint to come off okay now Im going
Bob Ross,to have two layers of Foothills so we want to create a misty area in between each layer thats the only thing that separates these layers so with a clean dry 2in brush Im going to tap the base of
Bob Ross,this and Im going to strike it quite firmly there we go see that that creates the illusion of mist down there just by tapping and then very gently lift upward just lift it upward okay now we have a
Bob Ross,beautiful Misty area right along in there thats what Im looking for now Im going to put another layer of Foothills Im going to use the same colors little bit of black a little bit of blue but this
Bob Ross,time I want it darker as things get closer to you in the landscape as weve said before they need to get a little darker just take tap that brush into the color okay lets go up here now then here we
Bob Ross,go see now we dont want to kill all that little Misty area that was in there thats the only thing that will separate these two entities its only separator its very important to you thats your
Bob Ross,good friend dont kill it dont kill it there we are see that easy we have another layer of Foothills and then well take that clean brush and once again I want to tap the base of it just to create
Bob Ross,that illusion of mist and then lift upward aint that a super way to make some little Foothills that are far away and very soft and quiet and it works now then now then this has some fun Im going to
Bob Ross,take some of the liquid white and put on my pet and well get a fan brush into the going to add a little bit of the phthalo blue on the brush and go right into the liquid white so its a very thin
Bob Ross,paint very thin maybe reach over here and pick up a little bit more of the liquid white there we are okay now lets go up here I want to put some little indication of some happy little little bushes
Bob Ross,right here see all you have to do is just touch with a fan brush and pop upward just give it a little upward pop now this paints much thinner than whats on there so itll just come right off your
Bob Ross,brush just like so that easy there we go now we can wash the old brush okay now its time to start making some decisions back here and we start working forward so Im going right into the titanium
Bob Ross,white into that Im going to add the least little touch of bright red let me say that again the least little touch its very strong a lot of paint on the brush both sides are loaded full okay lets go
Bob Ross,back up here now we have to start thinking about the lay of the land so just grab that and begin begin pulling it now we want to create the illusion of Shadows and and highlights and warm and cool
Bob Ross,spots all through this snow back here there we go and every once in a while you can pick up a little bit of the the phthalo blue a little bit and work it in there and itll help create that illusion
Bob Ross,theres little Hills and bumps and all kind of things happening back in there there theres a little bit of pink right there its a super super easy and very effective way of making some beautiful
Bob Ross,beautiful snow areas you can add a little a little bit of the Indian yellow here and there just to just to make it shine because itll reflect whats up here in the sky you know the stories weve
Bob Ross,heard about yellow snow be careful dont get too much of it there there we go and you can turn this into an extremely warm painting sometimes winter painties are so cold that they theyre not theyre
Bob Ross,not much fun to look yet I like to make winter scenes that are nice and warm and make you happy okay okay lets do something Im going to take a mix up well take some black and some blue little bit
Bob Ross,of lizard crimson and just mix it with a knife and the least little touch of white into it titanium white there we go there good dark color okay let me wipe my knife off here now then well take the
Bob Ross,old fan brush and load it full of paint just pull it through there give it a little wiggle see theres a lot of pain in the bristles okay lets go up here maybe right back here lives I think we had a
Bob Ross,yeah we had a happy little Evergreen that lived right there take just the corner of the brush and begin working back and forth I had a lady in one of my classes she call these Z trees she says cuz all
Bob Ross,youre doing is going back and forth and making little disease and I think thats a a good analogy just sort of work it back and forth and youre forcing the bristles to bend downward see how see how
Bob Ross,those bristles are bending and that makes all those little hangy down things that are under the limbs makes your tree look really nice we dont want him to get lonely you know always always give him a
Bob Ross,little trees a friend because friends are so important I think theyre even important to trees there we go and that quick we got a couple of happy little trees back here and we can take our fan brush
Bob Ross,it had the white on it add a little blue to that load it full okay lets go back up here and lets put the indication that maybe theres a little snow hanging on look at there just a little dont want
Bob Ross,to kill all that dark because its nice and contrasty helps makeing little trees stand out just put the indication of a little bit of snow there there we go okay maybe maybe theres a happy little
Bob Ross,weed that lives right there okay going wash off my old fan brush then we can begin going back into our snow colors and then reach right up in here grab under there and sort of pull that out and begin
Bob Ross,working with a lay of the land here look at that see now youve set that tree right up on a little Hill back here and thats where that little tree would be happy you know when you watch this
Bob Ross,beginning of the show it only takes about 30 seconds to see the whole thing but it takes a lot of fantastic people a long time to animate that they do that one frame at a time I couldnt believe its
Bob Ross,first first time I saw him doing that really made me appreciate some of the some of the magic of television and we were very fortunate we work with the best crew in the country here there we go all
Bob Ross,kinds of little things happening okay that gives us a little background and some snow lets have some fun now lets go to the old round brush and go right into some Bandy Brown a little bit of dark
Bob Ross,Sienna and were just going to tap it into the bristles okay lets build some happy little trees maybe lets go right here maybe theres a little tree that lives right here some little bushes and
Bob Ross,weeds they come right on I dont know where they go wherever you want them to go thats where they go and I bet I bet we yeah I remember we had some on this side too so well just drop some right over
Bob Ross,here I like to start at the bottom on these trees and work upward that way that way the darkest color is at the bottom and it creates deeper Shadows Shadows on the base of the tree there we are and
Bob Ross,all youre looking for here is just some very basic little tree shapes were not looking for a lot of detail yet detail will come later right now all were looking for is just some happy little shapes
Bob Ross,lets put a few more in there I think they were a little thicker there we go thats getting pretty already I like these these little warm winter scenes they they do nice things in here they make you
Bob Ross,happy okay little little thinner on my liner brush and well just pull it through some brown and turn that brush turn it and pull it out it brings it to a very sharp point there you can see it okay
Bob Ross,lets go up here and in here Im just going to put the indication of a few little trunks just a few here and there most of them you wont ever see but should they show through it gives the painting
Bob Ross,some detail and thats always is nice just here and there wherever you think a little trunk should live to hold up all this trees and shrubs back here just drop it in drop it in shoot I tell you what
Bob Ross,Lets do lets put some pretty colors on there Im going to go right into some of the yellows here some yellow ochre some CAD yellow little Indian yellow just tap this brush into it and the least
Bob Ross,little touch of the red least little touch okay lets go back up here now maybe maybe theres a tiny bit of highlight just playing right on the top of these just to create a little color and if you if
Bob Ross,youre out selling your paintings a lot of times people will buy your paintings because of the color more than the content because they they have a special place in their house that that that color
Bob Ross,combination will just fit and warm colors are very popular right now I think maybe theyre always popular people dont like to be cold maybe maybe right there there we go little bit more of the bright
Bob Ross,red lets put a happy little Bush that lives right there and all Im doing is just tapping with the top corner of that brush thats really all Im doing just barely touching now your paint has to be a
Bob Ross,little bit thinner than whats on the canvas if you want it to stick the yellows I use are a little thinner than the other colors that way they stick easier and yellow is normally always used as a
Bob Ross,highlight color there see just layer after layer after layer just layer after layer okay now then we can go back to our fan brush and we can begin just running right up in here and grabbing this and
Bob Ross,pulling it out you dont care if a little bit of that brown color comes out into you snow thats the only thing worse than yellow snow there we go pull it right down but it makes it look like Shadows
Bob Ross,there we are okay now then over here on the other side maybe maybe well take some of those same little yellows just tapping and lets put a few highlights right on here you know we all do things we
Bob Ross,dont think about and sometimes theyre just automatic and the other day I was I was doing a demonstration for a fantastic group and a young man about oh he was probably about 10 or 12 years old just
Bob Ross,walked behind me and I heard him saying out of the corner of his mouth as he walked around me he says maybe maybe maybe so I could tell hed been watching the show and I dont realize Im doing that
Bob Ross,sometime but he made me aware of it so he was cute and he he brought in some fantastic paintings to show me then we recently did a show in Missouri and I had a young lady that was four years old bring
Bob Ross,me some paintings son of a gun she was she was just Fantastic Four years old and already shes a fantastic painter by the time she gets my age you know 22 shes really shes really going to be
Bob Ross,something if you believe Im 22 I want to I want to sell you some land in Florida there okay tell you what lets do that painting had a little cabin in it happy little cabin so lets do one of those
Bob Ross,well start here with some vanc brown cut us off a little bit there see its right out on the edge of that knife there you can see it real good okay lets go up here lets start with the back Eve of
Bob Ross,the cabin well give him a little back Eve like so now this may not be an exact duplicate of the painting that you see animated cuz you can never go back and do a a painting thats exact but itll
Bob Ross,show you how that painting was done and you can do your own at home there see need the side now then let me grab some white this is just straight titanium white touch and give him a happy little roof
Bob Ross,dont want him to freeze death got to give him a roof there and sometimes youll find its easier to scrape out the basic shape and it helps remove some of that loose paint its underneath put a
Bob Ross,little snow on the other side little bit right down there take a little bit of the dark Sienna and some white and lets put lets put some highlights on these boards just some highlights makes it look
Bob Ross,like old old wood little bit of brown give him a door there and we can take just the point of the knife and create the illusion of some old slabs here this this cabins made with old boards little bit
Bob Ross,of blue and white and we just put the indication of a little window right there thats really hard to see but its there okay now then lets go right up in here and put a little snow coming right down
Bob Ross,through there right down and then you can cut this off and put it wherever you want it and well take this is a little bit of oh little lizard and crimson and a tiny bit of phthalo blue make a
Bob Ross,lavender color dark lavender color and we just put the indication of a little happy little path right here see he needs a little way to get out of this cabin then we can come back with a round brush
Bob Ross,and go back into some of our yellows touch of the red tap them in lets go right here and well come right right along here and we lets well just let a few little bushes grow right up around the
Bob Ross,edge of his cabin that sort of sets it back into the painting and if I lived in this little cabin i Id want to sit back in the bushes and trees where where the salesman couldnt find me Id be
Bob Ross,hiding back here okay then we can take a little bit of the titanium white and just sort of smooth that out on the bottom okay and easy now then we had a little fence so Im going to just dip my liner
Bob Ross,brush right into the liquid black thats the easiest way to make a little fence see just pull it down and we just let it go right on back maybe it goes right on over the hill back here and theres
Bob Ross,still some still some old fence things laying across there like that let them go with the liquid white we can come right back and lay a little bit of snow on there see isnt that super really gives
Bob Ross,you painting a lot of detail and when youre doing this at home you can you can just get crazy and put all kinds of beautiful little things maybe well have this post come right behind the house we
Bob Ross,dont know where it goes that way there okay now then lets go over here play a little bit on the other side I want I think well put some big bushes Im tapping that same old brown brush I havent
Bob Ross,cleaned it yet right into the Browns again lets go up here and and and were going to have great big tree oh right over my pretty bushes back here this big tree oh he is a big tree he lives right
Bob Ross,here see just start thinking about some basic shapes how you want your tree to look look at there a big old tree there he comes you put this dark in so the light will Shi when you put it on there
Bob Ross,there is a happy little Bush this comes right on down that looks good already now then little paint thinner right into the brown just really low to brush full okay let go up here see and turn that
Bob Ross,brush when youre pulling it down turn it it helps helps make all kinds of old gnarly effects keeps your tree just from being a future telephone pole see and just drop all those little things in then
Bob Ross,we can take our round brush and right back into the yellows little bit of the the bright red just tap it okay and well go right up here see and just just put the indication of a few little highlights
Bob Ross,just some warm colors in here there and as many or as few as you want just drop them in at that super that you can make all those little things that quick sometimes its fun to go right into lets
Bob Ross,take a little bit of the the blue and white mixed together and look at there well put one in that gives it a little bit of cold feeling maybe hes got a friend right there makes a little cold in
Bob Ross,there with all that warm just makes all kinds of beautiful little things happen there we go theres one right there and as many of them or as few as you want its up to you painting painting gives you
Bob Ross,freedom gives you freedom and I think we all are looking for that at least I am there we go all kinds of little happy things all righty let me lay that brush down and well go back go back to Old fan
Bob Ross,brush and and little color in it were just mixing between blue and a little pink and then were going to change this plane in other words I want this to go there in a in a different angle so it looks
Bob Ross,like its overlapping whats back there just by changing the angles here you can create all kinds of fantastic Illusions see just and it doesnt matter once again if you pick up a little bit of that
Bob Ross,color it really really adds to your painting now take a little bit of the this is just a little bit of blue and white on the brush just tap in a few little few little happy bushes and weeds coming
Bob Ross,right down like that theres one okay I tell you what as you know I like big old trees so lets do a big old tree Im going to go right in to vany Brown and pick up some of the midnight black and just
Bob Ross,mix them together okay lets go right up here here maybe there lives a big tree oh he does now does now right there right there see big old tree lets give him an arm boy he is a big tree and all
Bob Ross,were doing right now is just looking for a very basic shape very basic shape and we can take a little bit of the Browns and white this is dark Santa and white and lets just put the indication of
Bob Ross,some nice little highlights here just here and there just here and there like so okay while I got the old knife going here few little fences post we had I think in that one little white like so going
Bob Ross,take the old liner brush and well put the indication of a of a happy little limb here and there and the Old Clock tells me its time to leave for this week so I hope youve enjoyed this one I hope
Bob Ross,youve enjoyed seeing it at the beginning of each show and until next time Id like to wish you happy painting God Music bless Music a
Bob Ross,hi welcome back Im glad you could join me today today I thought wed do a fantastic painting that has some big allmighty mountains in it maybe some big trees and lets just start and see what happens
Bob Ross,lets start off and have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting and itll come across starting with a titanium white and working right around while
Bob Ross,theyre doing that lets go up here Ive already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white and its wet and slick and all ready to go thought today would start out with a with a
Bob Ross,touch of yellow ochre Just a Touch just tap the brush right into the paint okay lets go up here now then Im going to start right up in here and just use little crisscross Strokes just put a small
Bob Ross,small amount of this yellow ochre just in the sky just let it sort of bounce around and play just like that okay now to that Im going to add the least least little touch of a lizard Crimson a very
Bob Ross,very small amount see what a small amount its on there tiny bit okay lets go up here and Im just putting a little lizard and Crimson right along the edges here and in reality this Crimson acts as a
Bob Ross,barrier cuz Im going to have blue over here and if the blue touches this yellow you know youre going to have a bright green sky and we dont want that today okay so just a little Crimson it just
Bob Ross,just protects the yellow now then Im going to take and go right into the midnight black and pruss in blue oh these are too strong colors be so careful okay lets go back up here now just bounce in a
Bob Ross,little of that still making the little crisscross Strokes just the way the teacher used to grade my paper just little Xs all over the place and maybe theres a little bit right here okay Im going to
Bob Ross,have some water in this painting I am an absolute fanatic for water so well take the phthalo blue tiny little bit into that Im going to mix a little phthalo green so we got phthalo blue and phthalo
Bob Ross,green lets go right here and just pull it across use very little of the phthalo green it is so strong so strong and pull from the outside in leave a little area open in the center and itll look like
Bob Ross,a little little Sheen of light coming across your water when the paintings done all right now then let me just grab a clean brush Ive got several of these old brushes going so it saves me some time
Bob Ross,be sure your brush is good and dry and start in the light area and begin blending outward still making those little crisscross Strokes just blend it all together there we go so you just have a small
Bob Ross,small amount of yellow in the sky you put a little bit more of the yellow in the sky when you initially start than you want because itll be ate up these other colors would just sort of eat it up Im
Bob Ross,going to take a little bit of titanium white into that add the least little touch of bra red least little touch cut me off a little hunk okay lets go up here maybe theres a happy little floater
Bob Ross,Cloud just sort of lays up here in the sky you just put these on with a knife see just push them right into the fabric little floaters there they go to show you how to make those then we take our 2-in
Bob Ross,brush and very lightly following the angles just lift them hope you can see those theyre quite light I dont want very bright clouds in this painting but when youre doing yours if you want clouds
Bob Ross,that stand out a little more add a little color easy to do lets build us a mountain lets start with some Prussian Blue some vany brown some lizard and Crimson just a small amount of a lizard and
Bob Ross,Crimson unless you want purple mountains little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife lets go right up in here well make some big old huge mountains look at there and we push that paint into
Bob Ross,the canvas push it right into the fabric youre not going to hurt this theres really not much paint on the knife push it just try to push it right through the canvas and then scrape off all the
Bob Ross,excess the more you can scrape off the easier The Next Step will be really really really scrape hard then take the large brush grab it and pull see cuz this canvas is wet with a liquid white you can
Bob Ross,move this son of a gun wherever you want it this was a dry canvas this wouldnt work boy youd be in agony City there see just pull it like that and just let it blend right on down till its just just
Bob Ross,sort of hanging there in the midst the only thing youre worried about at this point is a nice outside edges you could really could really care less whats happening below that okay Im going to take
Bob Ross,white pull it out as flat as I can get it and cut across see lets do that one more time while the camera is close you can see it pull it out very very flat and cut across get that little roll of
Bob Ross,paint so important so important lets go right up here there now just barely touching the canvas barely touching the canvas just allow that to flow right off your knife no pressure absolutely no
Bob Ross,pressure just let your hand just float pretend youre a whisper floating across here this is probably one of the biggest problem areas that people right and tell me theyre having is making this paint
Bob Ross,break and by break I mean leave all these little holes in it and 99 times out of 100 one of two things is happening youre using paint that is too thin or youre applying too much pressure so you need
Bob Ross,a firm paint and no pressure they work together they work together thats thats what allows you to do all of this there we go and you can just put as many or as few of these things in there as you
Bob Ross,want just take a little thth little blue and white just blue and white right like that pull it out and cut across once again you need that little roll of paint okay and lets go back in here and begin
Bob Ross,dropping in some beautiful little Shadows notice the angles angles in mountains are very important your highlights go in one basic angle and your shadows go in another angle see put all kinds of
Bob Ross,little things in there all kinds of little little places you know the theres maybe a mountain goat lives up here and he needs a little place to hide and keep getting cold at night give him give him a
Bob Ross,little place up here there there we go just like so as many as you want anywhere you want to create the illusion of a little Ridge all you have to do basically is drop in a little Shadow thats all
Bob Ross,these are your mountains and you can do anything in these mountains that you want anything anything total freedom here okay and Ill take a clean dry 2in brush and I want to diffuse this so Im
Bob Ross,tapping very lightly and following the angles of the mountain always follow those angles there over here you follow these angles whichever way the paint goes thats the way you want these little Taps
Bob Ross,to go now lift upward gently gently lift upward that takes out the little tap marks softens Blends and creates that beautiful beautiful Misty effect down at the base of the mountain and that easy that
Bob Ross,easy you have it okay now then I just take old 2in brush its already dirty Im going to take a little midnight black and a little bit of blue little touch of vanik brown into it we leave him throwing
Bob Ross,in tiny bit of white there we go just tap that brush okay lets go right up here now maybe maybe well just touch in like that and create the illusion of a few little grassy things that are running
Bob Ross,little trees that are running right up the mountain way back in the distance here far far away and you can use a 1-in brush and lift upward just lift upward see there looks like little trees going
Bob Ross,right up the side of that mountain far far away far away very soft all right and tell you what Lets do lets just use that same color band brown black blue little white lets go right in here and
Bob Ross,maybe theres some beautiful little Foothills just with a corner of the brush just using the just the corner you can create the illusion of all kinds of little Foothills living right here look at
Bob Ross,there see there that easy now then with a clean brush I want to create Mist at the bottom of these so just tap give it a pretty pretty strong tap lift upward yeah that easy that easy we got a little
Bob Ross,footy now the lets take the round brush I like it its fun going into some van Dy Brown a little bit of dark CNA just mix them on the brush Im going to throw in a touchy sap green too just tap okay
Bob Ross,lets go back up here now maybe were getting a little closer were beginning to see more color more detail so well just tap in some little background trees just some little background trees they
Bob Ross,live right here wherever you think they ought to live thats thats exactly where they ought to live there see and you say oh my gosh hes made one heck of a mess down here you may be right too but
Bob Ross,what Im hoping for because this canvas is wet you can do this watch right here you can grab this and turn it right into Reflections just giving it a little gentle pull downward there and then like L
Bob Ross,lightly go across instant Reflections its may be the nicest thing that happens with this painting technique okay lets put a few highlights on there Im going into some cadum yellow little bit of sap
Bob Ross,green some yellow ochre and Im just going to mix these colors on the brush just brush mix them all right lets go back up here now just with the top corner of the brush just tap in some indications
Bob Ross,of of all kinds of happy little things happening here little bushes little trees far away dont put in too much detail its too far away when things get closer to you then you begin seeing all the
Bob Ross,beautiful little detailed things but back here you dont see all that detail so dont overdo it sometimes that can be very disturbing in a painting when theres too much detail and something that you
Bob Ross,want to look too far away it RNs that Music illusion there we go see and layer these things do one at a time and work forward forward forward helps create the illusion of distance depth in these
Bob Ross,bushes you know those little tree urchins have to have a place to live tree urchins and squirrels so they got to have a little place back here to hide see that you dont care if a little bit of this
Bob Ross,yellowish color gets down into into your water because all you do do is take it pull it down also and it becomes part of the reflections and really really makes your painting look a little better
Bob Ross,learn to work with whatever happens we dont make mistakes we have happy accidents happy accidents take a little brown and white right here cut across it a little tiny roll of paint and lets just put
Bob Ross,the little indication of land right in here just a little I dont I dont want a bunch just a little far far away far away like so there we go just barely touching the canvas allow the canvas to pull
Bob Ross,off what it wants take a little bit of liquid white and with that we can just cut in the indication of a happy little water line and this water line it tends to clean up the bottom of your little
Bob Ross,bushes and trees back here and it gives you a lighter area in between the dark so it separates and painting youre paying playing light against dark dark against light continually thats what makes it
Bob Ross,work all right now we can come on into the foreground here and really start playing lets have some fun lets get crazy today Im going to take some brown well throw in some Prussian Blue some samp
Bob Ross,green some black anything thats dark we dont care what a mess clean this knife off thats certainly dark now Im going to take the 2-in brush and just go right into the paint and wiggle it this is
Bob Ross,just an old dirty brush it was laying there wiggle see wiggle it wiggle wiggle it wiggle it and then sharpen it just like you would a fir knife see there now look how sharp that is there you can see
Bob Ross,it oo thats just like her a razor thats a chisel Edge okay lets go up here now with this super sharp chisel lets have a happy Evergreen that lives Bo he sure does now right there now sometimes we
Bob Ross,avoid this old Big Brush but look what it can do it makes the most beautiful Evergreens dont be afraid of this 2-in brush jump in there and use it play with it it comes to a super super sharp chisel
Bob Ross,Edge and you can do this with it it might might make better looking Evergreens than some of the smaller brushes they have a lot more character to them come down to about right there now then can take
Bob Ross,my knife take a little this dark Sienna little white into it pull it out cut off a little bit of paint let create a little tree trunk and you dont see the entire trunk but just here and there where
Bob Ross,you think you might see it a little little tree trunk okay Ill use this same old dirty Big Brush Ill go right into some of the cad yellow now since we had a little blue in that color automatically
Bob Ross,this is going to turn green beautiful green color bring it back to a chisel Edge okay lets go back up here now then lets take and just put the indication of some highlights on this big old tree some
Bob Ross,nice bright spots a that easy you have a fantastic little Evergreen okay lay the old brush down here Im going back to the round brush we go into our Browns this is a dark Sienna the van Dy lets have
Bob Ross,some fun right in here in here were going oh look at here here comes a tree look at here big strong tree he lives right there and all were doing right now is putting in the basic shape for that tree
Bob Ross,just the basic shape at that fun I like this old round brush you can just tap in all kinds of things okay well take the liner brush well go into a little paint thinner right into some brown the
Bob Ross,thinner will thin your paint down till its like water turn that brush bring it to a point we go right in here and just put the indication of a of a happy little tree trunk you could also do this with
Bob Ross,a knife if you want it to however you want to put it in however I tell you I tell you what lets tap a little more of this brown in here I bet over here on this side would be a good place to have
Bob Ross,another little tree while we got it going lets just put one right in here h see how easy that is you can just put in all kinds of little things now I see a reflection right here right here watch see
Bob Ross,just pull it down once again because a liquid Whites under there this is so easy instant Reflections instant Reflections now we can put some highlights Ill just use the same old dirty round brush

Bob Ross,some happy little shapes dont kill all your dark areas dont kill them all look at that see if you put too much detail then its going to look too close and we want this to look like its far far
Bob Ross,away and very quiet soft there add a little bit of the bright red to that color oh look at there theres a nice one nice one okay right there all kinds of things and work in layers layer after layer
Bob Ross,after layer and thats what will create the depth in your painting okay now we can come down here put in a little more of the dark and we can start putting in the highlights as i say this is where you

Bob Ross,yellows and tap it see just tap it okay lets go right up here now then just begin touching say very gentle like so and you can make a layer after layer after layer when youre doing this if you have
Bob Ross,trouble getting your paint to stick add a little bit of liquid white or a small amount of paint thinner just to make your paint a little thinner there i added a touch of the bright red there just to
Bob Ross,get it to stand out a little see you can just make layer after layer nice and bright there we go anywhere you want to heal just put a little bright area and it creates the illusion of a happy little
Bob Ross,hill there there well just put another one there and let it work right on up and just sort of let your imagination go when youre doing these at home see over in here well just pull that across
Bob Ross,well come back and play with that later watch here now well take a fan brush and very gently with a fan brush lets make the indication of just just a happy little path that lives right up here all
Bob Ross,youre doing is grabbing a little bit that color and just pulling it if you want to here and there you can add a little bit of brown just to make it look more like dirt but allow it to grab these
Bob Ross,colors and just pull it right on out there and youve got a little path that easy my head with a touch of titanium white there just to make it look like theres a little sun playing through there just
Bob Ross,a little sunshine okay we can take the knife and just scratch in the indication of a few little trunks back in these distant trees little background trees just here and there now then lets me find my
Bob Ross,fan brush well go into some brown and some of the midnight black lets build a little tree lets have some fun a lot of paint on the brush lets go right up here maybe there lives right here right
Bob Ross,here just a happy little evergreen tree all im doing is just just barely touching the canvas and well take the corner of the brush and give it a little upward push see give it a little well put
Bob Ross,some little limbs out here on him just like so make his trunk nice and strong give him a little foots hes got to have something to stand on something to stand on okay maybe hes got a friend that
Bob Ross,lives yep right there right there his friends a little bigger a little stronger maybe hes got two friends just like him now then on these theyre a little closer so youd see a little more detail
Bob Ross,ill take a little white on another fan brush and just very gently very gently come along this edge and put a little bit of highlight just to make him stand out a little better and you can take your
Bob Ross,script liner brush a little bit of the liquid black and put a little helm here and there see there just a couple happy little limbs in fact our two inch brush and just sort of blend his little foots
Bob Ross,right into the right into the little grassy areas that easy back to our black brown mixture lets go up here and maybe yeah there we are its a happy little leaf little limbs little leaves on these
Bob Ross,trees just live right about there like that now then same old brush ill go right into a little bit of yellow because theres black on there when you hit that yellow its going to turn a beautiful
Bob Ross,green color load it full lets go back up here now you can come back and just put some highlights dont want to cover all the dark maybe ill make it a little bit brighter so you can see it a little
Bob Ross,more there that shows up a little better for you see there some nice leaves there and maybe theres even a few shining on this one back here hes father well youre not going to see as much detail on
Bob Ross,that one all right i think were i think were coming right along here now then lets have some fun lets bring the camera right up close here this is where the fun starts you grab this contact paper
Bob Ross,and take this off look at that look at that isnt that fantastic see already you have all your nice borders around here and whats really fun when youre doing this at home you might want to paint
Bob Ross,this oh like a nice tan color or a very light like chalk powder blue you can do all kinds of things so it looks like borders looks like its matted around there when you get all finished i get excited
Bob Ross,about these theyre a lot of fun okay well go right into some alizarin crimson a little bit of the phthalo blue proportionately much more crimson and the blue much more crimson just tap that big
Bob Ross,brush in there round brush and here we go this is whats fun to me i like to come out of these borders that we created and let the painting actually extend right out of the borders and all were doing
Bob Ross,here is just tapping in some very basic little shapes where we want some happy little things to be just like so see and were totally killing this border okay now then ill just use the same old brush
Bob Ross,well go right into some van dyck brown its a dark sienna and well put another little tree lives right here just all kinds of little trees see all those little things happening maybe theres a happy
Bob Ross,bush that lives right here these are really fun paintings i hope you try some of them theyre so so effective maybe that comes right on down wherever you want it to go wherever over here not much
Bob Ross,color let it like a vignette just let it get softer and softer and softer over here toward the edges there we go all right now then well take the liner brush lets put some paint thinner on it and go
Bob Ross,right into our brown turn that brush bring it to a nice sharp point okay now then lets go right up in here and heres some nice tree limbs lets let them protrude right out onto the pure white canvas
Bob Ross,see there look at them just here and there just here wherever theres some wee over there look at there you can just make all kinds of happy little elms this is just brown with paint thinner so it
Bob Ross,flows there we go but you have to make big decisions here how many limbs live in your painting just however many you want thats all okay and maybe down here just to change things a little bit maybe
Bob Ross,maybe this tree has a white trunk so ill just use a little bit of the liquid white and well put a a little white trunk in there its that easy i like to turn that brush it picks up all those under
Bob Ross,colors and makes beautiful little effects stay there see how that stands out though if you put dark against dark you wouldnt have a whole bunch but when you put this light against the dark oh they
Bob Ross,stand out and shine for you there maybe theres a little one right here however many you want thats up to you now we can have some fun lets take the old two inch brush and well go right into some
Bob Ross,color here this is yellow and green and im just tapping it like so okay lets go up here now then right along in here just barely touching the canvas just put in a happy little leaf here and let some
Bob Ross,of them extend out over your dark under color that helps create the illusion of a vignette see there these paintings really excite me this is this is reason i chose to do this type of painting on such
Bob Ross,a special day im really glad you joined me for this status as i say you just cant believe how special this is for me and youve made it possible there there we go now lets put some lets put some
Bob Ross,things in here ill go back to the round brush its a lot of fun ill just tap it into a little yellow ochre and a little green reach over here and get a touch of the bright red just a touch its very
Bob Ross,strong very strong just go up here now then just using the top corner just the very top gonna just tap in all kinds of little leafy effects now if your paint wont stick ive said it over and over add
Bob Ross,a little bit of liquid white or a little bit of thinner let them just come right over because a thin paint will stick to a thick paint thin to thick so probably our golden rule see a little of this
Bob Ross,project right on out past the dark theres another happy little bush thats right there see i knew he was there you did too didnt you you knew he was there there we go theres another little bush he
Bob Ross,lives right there okay coming right on forward oh theres one he looks like hes got little flowers on him happy bush its the only kind of bushes we make theyre always happy and well just sort of
Bob Ross,let some little things just just graduate out into here just let the color just sort of disappear gentle gentle light little touch see there these are very soft little paintings these make excellent
Bob Ross,gifts for all your friends people really love these and when you frame them oh you cant believe how pretty they are cant believe and your friends will say you didnt paint that but you know you did
Bob Ross,and you can you can do it yeah take just a clean pointed knife and scrape in a few little sticks and trunk indications here and there just like so all right you know me im not happy when we paint
Bob Ross,unless we have a big tree in there so lets put a big tree im gonna go right into the midnight black and the van dyck brown and just be happy mix up all these colors look at all the paint that brush
Bob Ross,lets go up here i said i wanted a big tree so lets do a big one i think my big tree lives dont yell at me dont yell at me he lives right there there he comes oh goodness big old tree he goes right
Bob Ross,off the canvas strong tree big tree look at that be brave be brave maybe hes got a big foot that comes right down here like that big old foot all right now ive got another fan brush i used earlier
Bob Ross,its got white on it so well just take it and well come right down the side here come right down the outside edge first see and tap just tap this makes a tree bark look sort of fuzzy and that to me
Bob Ross,is the way the way old evergreen trees look they got a sort of textured bark rough maybe right in here see how you can divide that tree up and create a little hollow in there shoot this one thats
Bob Ross,where some little creature lives right in there he needs a little house now then liner brush right into some of the liquid black and lets take and put a limb right there right there so you can put as
Bob Ross,many limbs as you want in yours well just put a few in just to show you how this is just straight liquid black see there we go and have some in there that are broken off evergreens especially boy
Bob Ross,they they have a lot of old limbs that get broke off and this is where all the little squirrels come and set and play they have to have a good time too now how we have this liquid black going here
Bob Ross,lets just work on look at there well just have it bigger root just come right on down it just sort of hangs right on off the canvas look at that and theres one right there and maybe maybe theres
Bob Ross,one that comes over the other way just use your imagination here let some of these little things just sort of happen okay we can go right into a touch of the liquid white and put a little highlight
Bob Ross,right out here just like that just like that isnt that something isnt that something i like these little paintings and i really hope you do and im glad that youve been with me today to share this

Bob Ross,leaves on this big evergreen tree wherever you think they should live see now i like this here because it breaks the border there but leaves it there so you can see it thats one of them happy
Bob Ross,accidents were always talking about learn to use them learn to make friends with them and itll be enough to show what we want to show right there right there right there there we go there we go okay
Bob Ross,now then take another fan brush well use yellow and sap green yellow sap green a lot of color on the brush okay lets go right back up here now then come right along in here and highlight these just
Bob Ross,put some happy little highlights right in there that easy and itll make your painting complete so if you paint along with me all you need right now is to sign your masterpiece and itll be finished
Bob Ross,and were going to call this one finished once again thanks for being with me today happy painting and god bless hmm
Bob Ross,hey welcome back glad you could join me today today I thought wed do a fun little painting I think you really enjoy this one so lets start out and have them graphically run all the colors across
Bob Ross,your screen that you need to do this painting along with me and as usual theyll come across in the same order as I have them on the pallet starting with the white working around while theyre doing
Bob Ross,that lets go up here and talk a little bit about what Ive done already as you can see today we have a black canvas now we make these black canvases by coating them with just a thin coat of black
Bob Ross,acrylic paint and allowing that to dry completely this ones a little bit different because this time I started with yellow I used in a yellow acrylic right in here then I took a little contact paper
Bob Ross,and cut out a little circle and glued it onto the yellow and then I painted it black then I let it dry and just before we started this I covered the entire canvas with a thin even coat of azarin
Bob Ross,crimson now Crimson is a very very transparent color this still looks black because its so transparent now were ready to start off and have some fun this particular painting Im going to do today
Bob Ross,came to me the idea did in the form of a postcard from a young man in Arizona so if youre watching thanks you know who you are youre about 11 12 years old and we write each other Im going to start
Bob Ross,out with a little bit of white and Im going to go right into CAD yellow white and yellow Ill put the white in there just to make the yellow a little brighter there we go really load that brush full
Bob Ross,look at there a lot of pain in the brush okay lets go right up here now this is going to be our sun were going to have a beautiful sunet so this is the Sun so well start from here and work outward
Bob Ross,we want this area to be the brightest part of our painting okay ready lets just go in here hit it and begin doing this oh my gosh and just start look at there see that way automatically it gets
Bob Ross,darker darker darker darker as it works out from the sun look at there now then the problem is you need to clean that brush between every loading you dont want to ever take this dark color back into
Bob Ross,the sun back into our yellow and white load the brush really full really full can just do that again right into here boom take out all your frustrations just really sock it spin that brush and begin
Bob Ross,working on some basic shapes you know in Arizona New Mexico they have some of the most beautiful sunsets anywhere in the country I have a lot of friends that live there there we go okay clean the
Bob Ross,brush again Im back into my white and CAD yellow low D brush full all right now then maybe boom right here there it comes heres another just big old arms coming out from here see just make all these
Bob Ross,beautiful shapes but you can see how this yellow is picking up at Crimson underneath and dont stay in one place and keep grinding it move it keep that brush moving washing the brush again Im about
Bob Ross,wore out a fan brush here yellow and white okay lets go right in here and hit it again this time well just bring this one maybe it just works right on off in here just like so maybe there just happy
Bob Ross,little things floating around here and there wherever you want them wherever and right along in here lets just do some little stringy things we can just put a few of those and few little fluffy ones
Bob Ross,just as many of these as you want there we go okay now then if you just tried blending all this chances are it would just mush up and you youd end up with a mess Im going to take the knife and very
Bob Ross,lightly just zip off some of the heavier areas where theres a lot of paint that color remains in the canvas dont worry about it see there you can just zip it right off I hope you wore your
Bob Ross,sunglasses today this is going to be a bright painting there we go and when youre doing these black C canvases you can do the base color with any of the transparent colors the blues the greens they
Bob Ross,all work just as well so experiment have some fun all right lets take the 2-in brush and now very gently lets just begin blending start in the light area and work outward look at there look at there
Bob Ross,all kinds of beautiful effects will just happen automatically these are our happy accidents dont fight them dont really try to plan this just just sort of do it and see what happens okay now Im
Bob Ross,going to wash the brush Im beginning to pick up a little bit more paint than I want so wash your brush at least by the time you finish this painting youre going to be expert brush washer lets go up
Bob Ross,in here and continue to blend anytime you go back to this light area always have a clean brush whether its a fan brush or a two-inch brush makes no difference always a clean brush in there look at
Bob Ross,all the beautiful red colors that are just shining that is one fantastic sky and theyre very easy to do and as I said earlier when you when youre trying this at home experiment a little try all
Bob Ross,kinds of different colors try some of the oh like phthalo blue is very transparent Prussian Blue all the greens are very transparent you can just make some unbelievable effects on these black canvases
Bob Ross,now then lets have some more fun take the same color same color load it back on the fan brush and lets just put lets put some more of these little stringy clouds in here I like him theyre sort of
Bob Ross,close to the Horizon Im sure theres a proper name for these clouds I just call them little stringy clouds Im bad about making up words so dont go to your dictionary and try to find half of them
Bob Ross,there we go just just little happy things right along here and there okay now very gently just blend these see there that easy that easy now lets have some fun lets come up here and lets remove
Bob Ross,this piece of of contact paper that I have here and Ill show you whats underneath it so lets come right in here watch just take the knife pick up the edge grab it and look at there look at that
Bob Ross,isnt that a super easy way to put in a happy little Sun okay now then let me find a clean fan brush and Im going to bring a little bit of that color over just to bring the edges together and to
Bob Ross,soften it just to soften it all together look at that see there maybe theres a happy little Cloud it just sort of floats across there you can just pick up a little the color and bring it right across
Bob Ross,and you can make a beautiful moon this way too doesnt have to be the sun it could be the moon now then well take a little more of that bright yellow color thats white with a little CAD yellow maybe
Bob Ross,theres a little cloud or two it just just literally floats right across like that however many you want and with a clean dry 2in brush very gently and just blend all that together thaty easy okay
Bob Ross,isnt that a isnt that a sneaky little way of making a beautiful beautiful sky very easy I thought youd like that lets have some more fun well take some vany brown some dark Sienna throw in a
Bob Ross,little black too what the heck were just looking mainly for dark colors we can throw in some Crimson whatever you got just dark drop it in there load that brush full of paint look at all the paint
Bob Ross,okay lets go right up in here and maybe theres a maybe theres a happy little mountain were going to have a small mountain in this because we want it to be far far away and Im just going to use
Bob Ross,the just the corner of the fan brush to put in our basic shape what I saying New Mexico and Arizona and all those they have some of the most beautiful beautiful mountain formations certainly not like
Bob Ross,the mountains that I grew up with in Alaska but beautiful okay maybe well have this one grow a little bit have some of the most unique rock formations there we go see there oh I know what Lets do
Bob Ross,lets have some fun right underneath here Im going to take some of the same yellowish color and pull it straight down like a reflection see pull it straight down pull it straight down and well take
Bob Ross,a big brush grab it pull hard see and were going to have some light under there look at that see now we have a little light area and our little mountain color same Mountain color we can just pull
Bob Ross,that right on down it goes right off into there wherever we dont know where it goes dont really care okay let me let me grab another fan brush I have several fan brushes going so I dont have to
Bob Ross,spend all my time cleaning them go into a little yellow little bright red yellow ochre and a little Indian yellow just just sort of mix all these colors up on the brush Im going to reach up here and
Bob Ross,grab a little bit of the dark Sienna too there there maybe a little more red okay now we have a multitude of colors going on in that brush theres not just one color there you can see it a little
Bob Ross,better look at all the things happening good lets go up here now then heres our light source so were going to touch and begin just creating the illusion of all kinds of beautiful little rock
Bob Ross,formations Im just using the just the corner of the fan brush look at all those its a super nice easy way to make some of the beautiful mountains some of the Fantastic Rock colors that you see in
Bob Ross,that part of the country see I know theres an old coyote sitting out there I can just sort of feel it hes sitting way down here at the base looking up at the moon and hes singing his song There we
Bob Ross,we are maybe a little touch over in here dont want too much dont want too much and anywhere you want you can go back with the dart and Shadow it you can change these as often as you want so now that
Bob Ross,come back put a little more red right in there would let that one really sing at that neat though that you can do them that easy okay G grab a little touch more of the red that looks a good put some
Bob Ross,there too just throwing in all kinds of little highlights we get some of the most fantastic letters from our friends in this part of the country you know its its unreal uh in some parts of some
Bob Ross,parts of the country in Arizona specifically theyre paying our show as as much as an hour and a half a day three shows a day thats thats unbelievable God I thank you very much and if youre not
Bob Ross,playing the show as often as youd like in your area call you station let them know what youd like to see they like to hear from you okay sometimes I I get to talk in here and forget to paint so wes
Bob Ross,paint well go back and well get right into our dark scene and and little vany brown tap a little color in there okay lets go right up here now then we begin to worry about the lay of the land were
Bob Ross,just going to begin picking up some little things here dont want to kill this little bright area I want to look like theres a little light shining through there when were finished leave some of
Bob Ross,those little soft Misty areas see I want this back here to be very dark okay now Im going to touch just a little bit of that same color that we used to highlight the the mountain here and begin
Bob Ross,playing a little of that here and there just where I think light would strike dont overdo dont overdo there let it just work right down into there see that little little soft area still stays in
Bob Ross,there thats what were looking for okay maybe theres another little Hill right here so you can just begin creating all kinds of Illusions there we go that is one fantastic Sky I hope you enjoy this
Bob Ross,sky and I really hope you try it as I said earlier a young friend sent me a postcard did it really gave me the idea for this painting we get so many of our ideas from from cards and photographs that
Bob Ross,people send so if you have something youd like youd like to see painting send me a card Id love to hear from you there we are now then now then maybe over here we have a little Hill coming down
Bob Ross,here Im back to my dark color just dropping that in I tell you H that looks just like a natural place so to be a happy little path going well do that in a minute well put a little path in there why
Bob Ross,not dont let your color get too bright on these canvases these black canvases Show color it seems like a hundred times more than a white canvas so be careful with them be careful be careful color
Bob Ross,just stands out on them lets take a lets take a fan brush here and Im just going to very lightly come right up in here and just sort of work it back and forth and create see just that easy you can
Bob Ross,create the illusion of of a little path I know coyote had to have a way to walk up and get up on this mountain so he could sing to the moon or the sun whatever I think we said this was a sunset begin
Bob Ross,to look like a moon scene to me though look at that see can you see that path just coming right in there that easy and it sort of goes around the corner try to avoid having your path perfectly
Bob Ross,straight it really looks a little better its got a little in it Little Bend in it just a a gentle bin that sounds like a name good name for a TV show gentle bin I have to remember that there we go
Bob Ross,now then back to my back to my 2in brush and lets just tap in a little bit more of this color just this this is yellow ochre little Indian yellow little CAD yellow and its on that dirty brush it has
Bob Ross,the brown in it so just allow these colors to all mix on the brush just tap it okay and you have to sort of make big decisions here wheres wheres your next little Hill going to be there it is see
Bob Ross,and you can create plane after plane after plane just that easy that easy and fantastic that you can make such effects so quickly darker darker darker darker darker see and that sort of closes that
Bob Ross,little path in there we go this is Arizona New Mexico and down there we got to put a cactus in this son of a gun we cant we got to have a cactus now I got to admit to you where I live in Alaska
Bob Ross,theres not a whole bunch of cactus theyre sort of rare but but Ill do my best here Ill do my best so if the cactus dont look just like it does in your yard if you live in that area uh pretend
Bob Ross,theres snow on it there we go okay see that easy we got some nice little Hills here and it creates a lot of Distance by having all of these different planes you can see way back in there there all
Bob Ross,right lets have some fun with some some Cactus Im going to go right into the liquid black with a liner brush just just dip it right in okay maybe theres a little cacti is that what you call him
Bob Ross,cacti or maybe thats more than one he lives way back in the distance right there and hes got arm see there get a little more paint we give him another arm look at there maybe you can just see the
Bob Ross,indication of a third arm there my golly thats not a bad looking little Cactus lets have one right here in front of the the moon well make this one even farther back farther back hes tiny little
Bob Ross,Cactus tiny just using the liner brush there we give him a little arm right there okay now then lets have a big Cactus we need a big strong Cactus he he really got a lot of light and life was good to
Bob Ross,him so lets lets build a big one big old cactus a lot of black I think this big Cactus is going to live he certainly is right now right there right there there this is just straight midnight black
Bob Ross,okay like that well just make him with a fan brush lets give him a big arm right here big old arm comes right down and bends plop just like that there we are give him a big strong arm he stands out
Bob Ross,here and waves at everybody that goes by Bring It Around like that does that look like a cactus there we go and down here we need a big strong bottom so it holds up all these arms and maybe we can
Bob Ross,just see the indication here of a third arm it comes right out here comes right on down just use your fan brush look at there see now this Cactus has three arms be hard to make a sweater for him there
Bob Ross,we go now we can begin getting the shape all the way we want it all right make him a little bigger down here at the base he needs a strong foots to hold up all that weight and sometimes sometimes
Bob Ross,theres just little cactuses that little Barrel cactuses or that look like that they look like a little post stuck in the ground nearly theyre pretty there we go now then okay all okay that gives us
Bob Ross,a basic shape for our little Cactus let me wash a fan brush here and in your painting you put as many Cactus as you want or as few now Cactus are normally green so Im going to go right into the black
Bob Ross,put a little black right there and a touch of the yellow see just a touch when you mix black and yellow it makes a beautiful green then Im going to tap I want to tap the brush and remove any the
Bob Ross,excess paint maybe so itll show up a little better Ill add at least little touch of white thats when youre painting yours maybe you dont want to add the white I just want you to be able to see it
Bob Ross,better tap out that excess paint there okay lets go back up here I want to make this look like theres a whole bunch of little sticky things on it so just touch see and start on the edge because
Bob Ross,heres your light coming from coming from the Moon over here or the Sun and just begin tapping see start at the bright Edge and work around that way itll get darker darker darker as it works around
Bob Ross,the cactus and it makes it look round and thats sort of nice them Square cactus this is theyre sort of rare there we go any there just tap tap tap and it gives the feeling of roundness to your
Bob Ross,Cactus maybe maybe right out here lights playing through and you can see little bit of fuzzy things right out on the edge them little fuzzy things what stick in your finger when you touch him make you
Bob Ross,go ooh there we are there we go just just a tiny we dont want this arm over here to be left out so can you see whats happening there all were doing is just touching just touch start with the
Bob Ross,outside edge do it first so itll automatically be the brightest and then tap tap tap right on around like C maybe a touch board right there well let some well really let some light drop right in
Bob Ross,look at there little bit of lights just singing right through there that one is Stand Out nicely now if you want to keep that one looking like its in the back Ill take my dark paint pull it
Bob Ross,distinctly over it so that way it makes that arm stay around that side if you dont watch it these little arms will sneak around on this side on you they sneaky little dudes okay this little round
Bob Ross,Cactus here we want some want most highlight right on the top top like that and then just gently gently come down the side same way just barely barely tapping lighter lighter lighter so it gets darker
Bob Ross,darker as it comes around well let it come right on out there we go and I hope this gives you a nice idea hope my friends like this in Arizona and New Mexico cuz they wrote me several letters wanting
Bob Ross,to have some paintings that showed their part of the country theyre very proud of their part and it is some of the prettiest prettiest country in the world I went to the Grand Canyon one time Ive
Bob Ross,never seen such a hole in the ground good gosh thats beautiful all right okay now we can just put on a few little highlights here and there well brighten these up a little Im using just a yellow
Bob Ross,ochre Indian yellow touch of the bright red Just a Touch just sharpen those up be careful with that red well that son of a gun will eat up your whole world in a second there we are okay I think were
Bob Ross,getting the feeling of a nice deserty type thing here now one of the things that worked very well was this light area that we put in here that really really does help lets take a little bit of red
Bob Ross,well sign this one and call it done I hope youve enjoyed it and I look forward to seeing you again next week so from all of us here Id like to wish you happy painting God bless Music w Music
Bob Ross,hi welcome back im glad you could join me today today i have a very special treat for you im very proud to present my son steve steves a fantastic artist that we send all over the country to teach
Bob Ross,the joy of painting and ive asked steve to come in today and to show you what he can do in just a couple of minutes so were going to turn the show over to steve and ill be back at the end of the
Bob Ross,show and see what youve done well ive already covered the canvas with a thin even coating of liquid white and the way im going to start out today is just touching the brush into a little bit of
Bob Ross,alizarin crimson and bringing it out into a separate space on the pallet just tapping it straight down turn your brush over tap tap now when the alizarin crimson hits the liquid white itll turn a
Bob Ross,pink color it wont look like it does on the palette so im just going to start right in using horizontal strokes but holding the brush sideways instead of the traditional flat way like this this
Bob Ross,gives you a little bit more movement in your sky and with that same dirty brush you can get a little bit more alizarin crimson and maybe a touch of phthalo blue and ill come right up here to the left
Bob Ross,hand corner and you just kind of bring that right down under the alizarin and always keep your corners the darkest because your suns coming from the center in this painting maybe a tiny bit of light
Bob Ross,blue in the center here a little bit more blue and alizarin and well go up into this corner and make it real dark too and well pick up a little bit more of that and throw some water in real quick
Bob Ross,while we got it on the brush its important that you use mostly the same colors throughout the whole painting it captures the eye better if you do if you use 70 different colors in one painting it
Bob Ross,usually doesnt look too good and i might even throw a little reflection in the center there now that we got all our shapes in here ill go back with a clean brush and just blend that out blend in the
Bob Ross,alizarin first because once you hit blue with your brush itll destroy any alizarin it hits always using that x thats what gives you that movement if i was just to brush it straight back and forth
Bob Ross,across itd just be one solid color and since your corners are real dark make sure you blend them real firmly the more pressure you add on the brush the more the paint will move for you and do a
Bob Ross,little hypnotizing and come down here in the water just pulling this all straight in okay now im going to use my fan brush and just going through a little bit of titanium white and you can add a
Bob Ross,touch of a lizard into that maybe make your clouds kind of pink now this painting is going to have big clouds in it well start one right here sometimes you dont want such a bold looking cloud and if
Bob Ross,you didnt youd use a probably a number three fan brush rather than a number six like im using its really your choice little clouds big clouds whichever you prefer and thats what you do if you get
Bob Ross,a hair in your clown clouds are usually real flat on the bottom and nice and puffy on top if you remember that you really cant go wrong on clouds now with my big brush preferably a clean one ill
Bob Ross,blend the bottom of the cloud out i never touch the top of the cloud thats where you want the most of your highlight to stay and just pull up on it a tiny bit this is real light three hairs and some
Bob Ross,air as my dad would say and hypnotize it okay and that about does it for the sky now im going to take my palette knife go through a little bit of brown and a little bit of alizarin and a little bit
Bob Ross,of blue kind of stripe them out like that into three different piles and then take a little bit from each one and put them together in the center and mix that together real good kind of gives you a
Bob Ross,dark purple color and well come right up here and make a big bold mountain now its important that you dont kind of linger around here and and mess around with this shape too much because it really
Bob Ross,doesnt matter as long as you have three or four peaks the highlight is what really counts its what really makes your mountain uh probably the thing i would want to tell you to stay away from right
Bob Ross,here is getting too much paint on the mountain you want to scrape it all the way down to bare canvas and then go back in with your big brush and pull it out and that way you get some of this paint
Bob Ross,glow down here to mix in with the mountain sometimes whether you do it on purpose or not its good to leave a real dark line in back of the mountain because that kind of makes it look like a super
Bob Ross,super dark shadow when youre done putting the highlights and shadows on sometimes that just turns out as a happy accident it usually just ends up there on purpose in other words and all im doing is
Bob Ross,just getting a roll of paint on the knife like this just pull it out flat go straight through and you get your roll and touching and just barely just light as a feather pulling and ive got a tiny bit
Bob Ross,of a lizard in there just like in the clouds and maybe this mountain will have a big valley in it you ever see that show the big valley thats where this mountain comes from now im going to mix up a
Bob Ross,little bit of shadow color and to do that you just use the base color that you use for the mountain a little bit of white and some prussian blue now you get a roll on your knife just like you did with
Bob Ross,the white except this time you push up into the white a little bit and pull away from it and that drags some of that light out onto the shadow side of the mountain too so it doesnt just look like
Bob Ross,its split directly down the center push up and pull it gets kind of tight right in these curves in the valleys right there and you have to come back and clean that up a little bit sometimes see like
Bob Ross,right around this edge i dont want to come back and maybe over here well have a tiny little glacier didnt need how you can just decide what you want in a painting and just put it right in there
Bob Ross,makes it so easy just like my dad i used little brushes for a long time before i ever started using big ones and its just theres no comparison at all too much too much piddling around with little
Bob Ross,stuff okay throw a shadow behind that and were just about ready to make our mist and to do that we take our big brush tap tap tap tap with the angle of the mountain and pull up with the angle and if
Bob Ross,you have a shadow crossing over uh your light like right here then you can come back and put one or two little strokes there because obviously you cant have a shadow casting a highlight okay now with
Bob Ross,my one inch brush ill take a little bit of our base color brown alizarin and blue and mix those all together and maybe ill even throw a tad of sap green in there and to that you mix white probably
Bob Ross,the ugliest color you could get at this point would be the best one to use because ugly colors look more natural in a painting than real bright flashy colors youll see what i mean here in a minute
Bob Ross,now without destroying the mist you have on the mountain you just want to tap in a shape kind of a rolling hill shape dont make it any harder than it is though its just as easy as it looks just
Bob Ross,splattering it right in and with a clean brush ill come back and lift that up just maybe a quarter of an inch right on the top and this gives you the illusion of little trees in the background now if
Bob Ross,you dont pull it straight up itll look like grass and were definitely too far away to be seeing grass and when you get down in here just pull all this up and then take the edge of your brush and
Bob Ross,smash in and this will create mist down at the bottom you can pull that up now with that same dirty brush i used for the first foothill ill add a little bit more brown and blue always mix your paint
Bob Ross,on your brush so you can get a marbled effect in your color if you mix it up with a knife then you just have one flat color and you dont usually see that in nature and try to keep your shapes a
Bob Ross,little bit different on this one and like before pull this up if you want to get really realistic about it then you should pull these trees up a tiny bit higher than the last row because they are
Bob Ross,getting a tiny bit closer to you ive been traveling around teaching classes since i was about 15 years old i started out with my dad and by the time i was 17 i was teaching my own classes and ill
Bob Ross,tell you one of the biggest things about teaching painting is not really the teaching of it but what you get out of the teaching of it and what you get out of the teaching of it is practice of course
Bob Ross,when you go into a classroom and teach people how to paint you might do 30 paintings worth of bushes or something trying to show them exactly how to do it so sometimes teaching can be a way to learn
Bob Ross,now over here on the left side i think ill throw in a bushy tree and what trees are is just a lot of bushes in one so you make each individual bush and kind of bring them all together see how this is
Bob Ross,a bush here and this is one here and this is one here and ill just kind of bring a row of grass thats a little bit darker right in front of the foothills and you want to kind of make it come around
Bob Ross,like this so that when i pull the reflections out itll look like this is around the bend or something it leads the eye into the painting rather than out of the painting if i had the land going up
Bob Ross,like this then youd want to just have your eye go right out now im going to put in a little trunk this is just using van dyke brown just touching and the way im doing that is just getting a tiny
Bob Ross,roll of paint and touching the canvas real lightly down here at the bottom of course the trunk is going to be a little bit fatter to hold up that top part and maybe a little bit of highlight on that
Bob Ross,ill just use a little bit of brown and white together just kind of pulling across the brown letting the thick areas pick up the light this will be an old birch tree and with the same dirty brush you
Bob Ross,use to make the tree you can go into a little bit of paint thinner and through some cadmium yellow just kind of pulling through the paint until you start to see little bushes in the paint like right
Bob Ross,there and thats when you know youre ready to turn the brush over where that heels to the top and come in and just barely touch sometimes it looks like were taking a run and jumping leap and
Bob Ross,smashing it in but were really not were just doing it real lightly and remember where your light source is coming from its coming from over here so you dont want this side of the tree over here to
Bob Ross,be darker and dont bring leaves all the way down to the bottom of the tree either now with that same color well ive already got it on my brush ill go out here and make a few little bushes one here
Bob Ross,and one there you dont want to make them all the same color so ill take a little bit more paint thinner still using that same dirty brush you can almost get away with not ever cleaning the brushes
Bob Ross,if you do it just right this is yellow ochre im using now not the prettiest color but like i said at the beginning of the painting all colors arent supposed to be pretty and maybe some indian yellow
Bob Ross,now theres a little trick that i teach my students when im out traveling around if youre going to put any sort of red in your painting then you want to put it in the center because the eye is
Bob Ross,always most attracted to the brightest color and if you put red in a painting then obviously its going to be the brightest color i like to mix red and indian yellow it gives you a real fire color and
Bob Ross,you dont need but maybe one of these or one little teeny idea of red but you can see how much difference that makes now underneath all of this stuff hanging over the water will drop a little land and
Bob Ross,you do that just by getting a roll like you did for the mountain and touching and then pulling and sometimes you can even pull and then drop over like this that gives a real good effect still keeping
Bob Ross,that round band look and to highlight that well use that same old brown and white color maybe with a tiny bit of blue in it and im just letting the white pickup on the brown where its real thick
Bob Ross,and real dense and its important that you let some brown come up into your bushes and stuff too so i can come back with a fan brush and a little bit of yellow on it maybe a drop of paint thinner to
Bob Ross,thin that down and make some grasses okay now i take my big brush and pull just a tiny bit of this out just barely grabbing the edge of the land and see as the land gets bigger so does the reflection
Bob Ross,naturally so when you get all the way over here pull it all the way down to the bottom and then you can use a clean brush or semi-clean in this case to go back and forth make it look more like water
Bob Ross,and now im ready to make my dreaded water line this is where i run into more problems when im teaching everybody has problems with their water line you pull it out flat like i did there and you cut
Bob Ross,across it and what youre doing is just getting a real fine line white on the edge of your knife and then youre cutting it straight in almost like youre trying to cut a hole through the canvas you
Bob Ross,can keep it straight all the way around the bend i know that sounds hard and youll have a tendency to want to put in a sideways line but dont ever do it always keep it straight okay and maybe right
Bob Ross,over here well have one big huge pine tree and pine trees are real easy you just kind of make them in a in a zigzag shape see just kind of zigzag it right down a lady in one of my dads classes used
Bob Ross,to call these z trees because you make it basically like a z and down here maybe a bush or two now with that same dirty fan brush you can go in and put a little bit of highlight on your tree and see
Bob Ross,how that dirty color you had on there mixes with the yellow and makes kind of a green thats what youre looking for and not every branch but maybe every third branch or every second branch you want a
Bob Ross,little bit of highlight and a small trunk maybe lets see and to finish it up some real bright bushes up front well steves finishing this painting up i would just like to come in here and thank steve
Bob Ross,very much for demonstrating the joy of painting today and we look forward to seeing you again so from steve and i happy painting and god bless bye-bye so you
Bob Ross,hi Im glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic little painting what come on lets do it lets start out and have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to
Bob Ross,do this painting with me and theyll come across in the same order that I have them on the palette starting with the titanium white and working around I thought today would do a beautiful little
Bob Ross,winter scene Im you know partial to winter scene since I lived in Alaska for so many years so lets go up here and do it Ive already covered the canvas with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white
Bob Ross,its wet and select ready to go Dan well start out with a little touch of the bright red and let me say that again a little touch it is very strong just tap a little bit into the two-inch brush there
Bob Ross,its just a small amount I guess go right up here and maybe well come lets go right in here just put in a happy little global dont want to set this on fire all we want to do is create a little glow
Bob Ross,right across here be careful once again this bright red can eat up your whole world in just a heartbeat there now thats mixing with a liquid white and you get a beautiful warm glow and maybe well
Bob Ross,just put a little bit right down in here what the heck anything we dont like we just cover up and if we like it its already there without cleaning the brush same old dirty brush Im gonna go right
Bob Ross,into the least little touch of Indian yellow its a very transparent now Im allowing that red that was already in the brush to mix with the yellow there we go okay just go back up here now right
Bob Ross,above the red small amount of the Indian yellow and use a little crisscross strokes little Xs and just blend all that together its like so very soft and very quiet we can just take the clean off the
Bob Ross,brush down here we dont care now then I have some midnight black going right here Im going to take a little black and a little bit of the phthalo blue and we just mix it together right on the brush
Bob Ross,just tap it I still have not cleaned the brush Im lazy if I can keep them clean the brush boy Im all for that cant just go right up in here still use the little crisscross strokes and drop in a
Bob Ross,happy little sky yeah back and forth gonna come right down into there like so get a little touch more of the color I just black the black in there just to just a gray it a little bit alright okay let
Bob Ross,me clean the old brush now as you know thats my favorite part of the paintings is cleaning this whole brush shake off the excess just give it a nice little wrap there okay now with just a clean dry
Bob Ross,brush and be sure its dry you sure its dry that may be one of the biggest single problem areas we we hear people talk about is that the brush is not dry and they wash their painting drip right off
Bob Ross,on the floor let me get upset with me and I really I really want this to work for you and I want you to be happy with it there we go okay very soft and gentle just so you can blend this to any degree
Bob Ross,of softness that you want just sort of look at it make a decision and go for it this is your painting your world so you can you can create any kind of illusion that you want on this piece of canvas
Bob Ross,lets have some fun take the old round brush Im gonna go into a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna and just tap it tap it very firmly lets go right up here maybe right in here we
Bob Ross,back in the distance lives a few happy little trees just like so this would have been a good scatter well we might do it yet we might put a happy little cloud in there go ahead and put these in yes
Bob Ross,like so there we go these will be far far away okay tell you what lets do put a little cloud in there just want to show you how to do that well use a fan brush today go right into the titanium white
Bob Ross,pull it through a little lot of paint into the bristles a lot of paint okay lets go up here maybe right in here lives a happy little cloud I use just the corner of the brush turn it wiggle it
Bob Ross,normally you should do this before you start putting your background trees in I just changed my mind decided I want to put a little cloud in here but when youre doing this at home I would I would
Bob Ross,really advise you do it before you put your background trees itll save you a lot of trouble there they have it lets take a nice clean dry brush and Im using just the top corner of the two-inch
Bob Ross,brush to blame the bottom of the clouds out barely touching tiny little circles tiny little circles see there now after that bird this is a big circle big grab it lift it upward youre still just
Bob Ross,barely touching the canvas and then very lightly blend the entire sky see thanks and that here you can drop in a happy little cloud clouds used to drive me crazy when I was traditional painter Id
Bob Ross,worked for days trying to put in a little clown Im going back to my round brush the dark Sienna the Van Dyck Brown so you just really tap it in there get tough with it tap hard just go back up there
Bob Ross,I tell you Im having so much fun these little trees yeah theres one he lives right there we dont wanna get loneliness giving a friend his friend lives there whatever were going down here we really
Bob Ross,dont have to worry about down here yet a little bit later well begin to worry about such things but right now all were doing is applying some very very basic little shapes I just want that pinkish
Bob Ross,glow to be really shining through the trees look at that nice tree that lives there think about the shape of a tree just think about it make up little stories about trees its a little taller you can
Bob Ross,get carried away with these Id like to do trees you know buddy travel all over the country doing demonstrations for for PBS stations and other fantastic groups all over the country and its unreal
Bob Ross,some of the fantastic new modern equipment theyve come out with recently I was doing a demonstration in a small town and there was probably about 150 200 people had showed up and they they gave me up
Bob Ross,and tastic me microphone and it was wireless and I didnt have any wires or anything on and I forgot it was on so just before the show I went to the bathroom needless to say with a wireless mic when I
Bob Ross,came back everybody knew her Id dinner I dont even worse what Ive been doing to be careful some time all right a basic tree lying in here if you want to call it that were doing is just tapping now
Bob Ross,then lets take the script liner brush and Ill dip it in a small amount of paint thinner and I want this paint to be just like water a liquid turn that brush that pulls it to it a nice sharp point
Bob Ross,see how sharp it is and it has long bristles on it get scoop here now here and there I did a happy little tree trunk just drop me wherever you want maybe theres wine that lives right there and let
Bob Ross,these old trunks just sort of wiggle and jiggle and carry on we dont want them all to be future telephone poles keep it moving if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little more of the
Bob Ross,paint thinner okay maybe up in this whole tree theres a big one lives there turn that brushes youre pulling us down turn it allow it to pick up all the color thats underneath there we go and were
Bob Ross,gonna cover up most deadly youre not really looking for a lot of detail right here just some basic shapes lets go over in this one told him to be left out give him a little trunk but maybe heres
Bob Ross,one sticking out through there I cant why night there maybe it goes right I lost the canvas we dont know where it goes all right yeah I wont take it another round brush and I want to begin
Bob Ross,highlighting some of these things and really making them stand out so start off with a touch this is titanium white and then Im gonna pick up a little bit of the phthalo blue and maybe I should say
Bob Ross,that a little stronger a little bit its like the red it is very very strong very powerful itll eat up all the white in the world in just a matter of a second but to tap that brush you really want to
Bob Ross,get a lot of paint in there a lot of paint okay lets go to the canvas now I want this painting to have both some cool colors in it and some nice warm colors so lets cool right up here and Im just
Bob Ross,gonna use a top corner of the brush to begin tapping on all kinds of little things like it maybe Ill add a little more white to my color so you can see it a little better there you go there see just
Bob Ross,all kinds of little little frosty thanks hmm and if you have trouble making your paint stick I had a small amount of the liquid white so you just sort of dip it right out into a little liquid white
Bob Ross,and then go back through it and because this is a little thinner then it will stick very easily takes a very little pressure on the brush here maybe lives a happy little push this is what keeps a
Bob Ross,little rabbit warm in the winter hes got to have a place to cut 11b be cozy dont worry not hearing this cold were gonna have snow down here then Im going back to my other round brush and with it
Bob Ross,go into a little bit of yellow to the bright red a yellow ocher CAD yellow and then to the red okay lets go back up here now right here with this nice glow is I want to use some nice warm colors just
Bob Ross,let them sort of bounce through Jess let them bounce through add a little more Becca there see you said all those little things happen and work in the layers maybe on this tree here the lights playing
Bob Ross,through there lucky there all those little colors beautiful little things happen this is all the yellows with a little bright red now who sets our lights coming through there over here to will Sparkle
Bob Ross,these up with a little color still working in layers Indian yellow a little bit of the red just go right up here put a little bit out in here theyre so round brush makes a fantastic little leaf
Bob Ross,effects for distant trees I really like it for distant trees dont want to get too much dont like it now Im going back to my round brush that has the blue and the white on it and lets begin playing
Bob Ross,some of those colors right into it so it just looks like a light striking over there on the side every once a while Im gonna add a little bit more of the liquid white so it sticks easy okay yeah we
Bob Ross,just sort of let these come together all the little warm colors and the cool colors are all playing together there okay lets go back over here maybe theres a happy little tree yeah we could just
Bob Ross,quickly drop on a few little things here and there think about some basic patterns just dont throw things on at random theres one right there wherever you are and you can put as many or as few in
Bob Ross,your world as you want if you want to look like theyre hanging down use more of the brush and just tap downward its also a super way if youre painting weeping willows theyre beautiful trees and
Bob Ross,theyre probably one of the easiest trees are to paint Oh kinds of little hang you down okay yeah well I got this old dirty brush going here Im just gonna pull a little bit of this color just like so
Bob Ross,I begin thinking about the lay of the land out here and all we do here is just putting in some base color were not really concerned about what it is at this point its picking up some of those Browns
Bob Ross,and all the colors that we have in the trees pulling all that out too but it gives you a feeling of the lay of the land and it gives you a starting point something to work with okay let me find my fan
Bob Ross,brush here Im gonna get him and lets begin putting in some details well go right into a titanium white I touch just a touch of the bright red okay now then you have to make some big decisions where
Bob Ross,is the snow let it begin playing pulling it across see use very little pressure and that color its underneath shows through and it automatically will make beautiful shadows for you theres always
Bob Ross,little bumps and stuff just create all kinds of happy little things there comes one I see one right there then blend it out a little yeah just like so come right now across and you just keep going on
Bob Ross,them however many you want theres another one just layer after layer after layer lets have some fun make some big decisions and what else do we want in here maybe maybe little cabin you know me Im
Bob Ross,Im crazy about little cabins hmm so lets try them back to you what will we will paint the cabin lets use it lets use a big brush today well take the 2 inch brush pull it through the paint now Im
Bob Ross,using the dark sienna and the Van Dyck Brown and just mix them on the brush see when you pull it wiggle it wiggle it both sides and then sharpen it just like you would or a knife I just pull it right
Bob Ross,through there and look at the sharp edge look at that it comes to a very sharp chisel edge okay lets go right up here now you got to make a big decision wheres your little cabin liver maybe today
Bob Ross,well have a big old cabin yeah Im gonna do the back Eve first so we just paid it off like so hello to little more paint and then we pull it straight down all were doing here is applying a base
Bob Ross,color okay we need a other side of the house see they just pull it down and a lot of paint a lot of paint on them I want that to be very strong then another side right here straight down like that now
Bob Ross,since our light source is coming from here we want this side of the cabinet to be lighter then over here so over here be sure this side is a good and dark real dark so it stands out nice okay now same
Bob Ross,old dirty brush Im gonna go right into a little bit of the white a little blue and just tap a little bit on the brush see just a little on the brush here do both sides and you can see it a little
Bob Ross,better maybe see there cant go back up here add it I want this to look like old weathered wood so all Im gonna do is just start touching and letting it bounce and come right down can you see that it
Bob Ross,looks like its old old old looks like my house okay now Im gonna do the same thing Im gonna make it darker once again I had a little black to it once again we want the side over here to be darker
Bob Ross,so load a lot of paint lets go back up there now then over here we want the same basic thing see just barely touching and let it work down so it looks a hold youre sort of touching and pushing at
Bob Ross,the same time a little bit on this side I cant come right a little house is about to fall over now then we can take the knife and work on our perspective here a little bit well see yeah you can just
Bob Ross,cut it off whatever you want it just like so and we need a roof on that cabin so it takes them the titanium white we use at night lets go right up here and lay in a little snow-covered that simple
Bob Ross,just let it work right down and you could take clean this edge up make it nice and smooth bet it overhang a little bit then grab it and pull there you go how easy it is to make a happy little cabin
Bob Ross,put a little snow on this side I can have at least least little touch of the phthalo blue I want to make it look like heres that edge on here theyll blue over here just a little blue with white
Bob Ross,tiniest tiniest little mountain already I tell you what lets do take the Van Dyck Brown pile without very flat cut across and get just the smallest little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife
Bob Ross,I have it right along here well just touch and make the indication of all kind of little boards whole weathered boards there we go dude do the tooth dope - and you can put as many boards and your
Bob Ross,cabin as you want put something out here then we could take our liner brush were just a little the liquid white on it well put the indication of some happy little icicles hanging off here there we
Bob Ross,go there we go whew over on this side every mini whatever that gives us a little icicle this old guy hes probably hes probably we ran out of storage space Im a junk saver so maybe he had to build
Bob Ross,him a little it lives right there heres a side cut a roof on his shed dont want him dont he sure to get full of snow itll touch you some highlight out here very touching we need some boards on
Bob Ross,that too okay lately once again you can cut it off tell you what lets do lets just lets put in a window right here theres one Arizona looks like two big guys dont take a little bit of kid yellow
Bob Ross,I will just make the indication that maybe somebodys home the lights are on there that easy you take a little touch of the liquid black and just go right around these that easy make them stand out
Bob Ross,there we go there we know somebodys home okay lets go back to her fan brush and we can begin coming right in here bringing all this together if you pick up a little bit of that brownish color dont
Bob Ross,worry about it dont worry about it it makes beautiful shadows beautiful little shadows here all these happy little shadows just drop on me just sort of work back and forth between the warm and the
Bob Ross,cool colors just all kinds of beautiful little things happen here let me pick up a little bit of the brown and maybe here and there there lives a happy little weave here in there there yes just drop
Bob Ross,him in lift up a little bit and you can take a look on the snow color just reach out of there clean up his foots and bring them all together okay lets get crazy why not well I can take some brown and
Bob Ross,some black well throw in some crimson shoot even the live it up a little bit of phthalo blue we dont care long is this good and dark let me clean my knife and well take the two inch brush and Im
Bob Ross,gonna go right into all that dark color just look at there pull it wiglet bring it back to a nice sharp sharp chisel ditch me that good chisel edge there it is very sharp okay lets go back up here
Bob Ross,tell you what lets do maybe their lives right there a great big evergreen tree he just goes right off the top of the canvas just use just the corner of the brush and tap as you work down the tree add
Bob Ross,more pressure tap harder and harder make those bristles Bend downward may come just bend look at that and that easy okay they dont create our happy big tree this is big tree and we can take another
Bob Ross,brush and put some white on it why a little touch of a blue there there okay lets go back up there and lets just put the indication of something a little bit of snow hanging here and there dont
Bob Ross,kill all the dark the dark is what makes us stand out just here there okay yeah there we can just begin playing with some of the nice things around here were gonna just take a little blue and white
Bob Ross,lift upward a little bit and begin just bringing all this together see create another plane that easy that worked right Ive been there just like so it sort of work it back and forth theyre all right
Bob Ross,now maybe maybe take the liner brush touch of the liquid black on it but it will stick or twig here and there theyre always sticking up out of the snow however many you want Ill tell you what maybe
Bob Ross,over here maybe theres a couple over in here too like so drop in a few here I think that makes a pretty nice little painting thank well call that one finished in fact so from all of us here Id like
Bob Ross,to wish you happy painting god bless well see you next time
Bob Ross,welcome back glad you could join me today you know they say that time really goes by when youre having fun and here we find ourselves on our last show of this series so i thought today you know since
Bob Ross,i lived in alaska so long i do a special alaskan painting so if you come up here to the canvas ill tell you what weve already done now ive taken a black canvas as you can see we painted this with
Bob Ross,just a flat black acrylic paint allowed that to dry and then on top of that ive put all different kinds of transparent colors ive put some right in here some alizarin crimson over in here some
Bob Ross,phthalo green phthalo blue and green mixed all over the canvas so its completely covered with a thick paint so its all ready to go so lets have them graphically run all the colors across the screen
Bob Ross,that you need to paint this project with me and i think today well do some northern lights so come on up here and lets lets get started im going to use the old fan brush today so probably one of
Bob Ross,the best ways to do this is sort of take and you can just on this black canvas you can draw in some basic shapes and if youve never seen the northern lights a lot of times theyre in what they call
Bob Ross,curtains or just layers now if in your part of the country theres no such thing as northern lights you can do the same scene leave the lights out and maybe put a little moon in the sky and itll be
Bob Ross,just as effective but once again for my friends in alaska today i want to do a northern lights picture start with the old fan brush right into titanium white now we already have all those beautiful
Bob Ross,colors on the canvas so all we need is white lets go up here now decide where these curtains or these lights are going to be and just begin tapping see all im doing is just tapping and tapping the
Bob Ross,color in and make your basic shapes just very basic shapes and put a little more paint where you want to be a little brighter we have one coming right across here and im just tapping titanium white
Bob Ross,on there sometimes theres little ridges and they bounce around and there it comes see just right on around the right and people will have three layers of lights in this painting and you can have as
Bob Ross,many as you want or as few as you want its up to you up to you now then now then this is where the fun starts lets take a one inch brush and im going to begin grabbing this and lifting it upward
Bob Ross,just grab it and pop it just pop it up okay there we go now already you can see it begin picking up some of the different colors and here like so lets grab this one lift it up boy johnny horton wrote
Bob Ross,a beautiful song about northern lights northern lights were running wild in the land of the midnight sun and i lived there for over a dozen years and that has to be that has to be one of the prettiest
Bob Ross,countries in the world god was really having a good day when he made alaska now then im going to take the 2 inch brush and go all the way through this and lift up all the way through follow the same
Bob Ross,angles all the way look at that there you go and you can pull these as high as you want them and some parts of the country they dont see a lot of color in northern lights they see maybe only whites
Bob Ross,or yellows and you can do yours that way where i lived right outside of fairbanks in a little town called north pole sometimes we would see lights in every color in the rainbow so that makes it a
Bob Ross,little more interesting so i figured if i did a bunch of colors you would find your color in here somewhere okay you see now right in here this is where the crimson was you have sort of a lavender
Bob Ross,feel in here and blue in here over here theres a little phthalo green mixing with a phthalo blue make some beautiful beautiful colors in the sky so lets wash the old brush give it a shake just beat
Bob Ross,the devil out of it and no painting of alaska would be complete without an almighty mountain take a little bit of black a little bit of phthalo blue ill even put a little van dyke brown in there very
Bob Ross,dark it out flat cut across get that little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife okay lets go up here you have to make a big decision where does your mountain live maybe right there it takes
Bob Ross,very little paint because the canvas is already black there i think put little bumps and hills and valleys whatever you want in your mountain just drop it in there like so and scrape off all the
Bob Ross,excess paint you really really cant scrape too hard then well take a large brush grab it and pull this just basically removes excess paint the more of this paint that you can get off the easier the
Bob Ross,next layer is to stick so take off all of it you can get off this is also an excellent way using brush strokes to begin laying out your highlights and shadows see see how you can pull all kinds of
Bob Ross,effects there maybe you want to see and youre not committed you can just keep changing this and playing with it maybe you want a little shadow you can see there its that easy to find out how your
Bob Ross,highlights and shadows will look in there pull it through or you can just keep going spend all day just play in there okay now then lets use our old knife im going to titanium white and a little bit
Bob Ross,of blue just a small amount of blue there just just enough to tint it good pull it out very flat as flat as you can get it get tough with it and come across get that little roll of paint right out of
Bob Ross,the edge of the knife just go back up here now then lets have some snow just coming right down the side of this mountain wherever you want it to go no pressure no pressure at all just let it flow you
Bob Ross,want that paint to break want all these little holes left in it there you go see it and you can wiggle that knife and cause all kinds of little effects to happen let it go okay right up here on the
Bob Ross,top we want one a little bit of snow right up here there it comes right down maybe it joins together you have to make big decisions here there we go okay maybe maybe theres some light striking right
Bob Ross,over here on that little ridge lets begin with our shadows for the shadows well take the blue and white mix it together like so maybe well make that a little bit lighter still a little dark for
Bob Ross,what i want thats much better cut across it our little roll of paint again okay now then no pressure no pressure just let it barely caress the canvas and just begin laying in all kinds of little
Bob Ross,things anywhere you want a little ridge just drop it in this is your painting your world you can do anything that you want here a little bit right back here see now we can take this one and pull it
Bob Ross,distinctly through and it pushes that one right back do you know you had that kind of power could you push mountains around why did i go home the only thing i can push around is a chair but here i can
Bob Ross,push around to anything mountains and trees and rivers there we go put a happy little peak right up there right up there now were using a very firm paint here we want this paint to be as firm as
Bob Ross,possible look at that okay now see this little point here it needs to have its own private shadow if it doesnt have its own shadow then it wont stand out like an individual and you can just balance
Bob Ross,it back and forth here and play shoot look at there maybe maybe theres another one that lives right there as many or as few as you want in your world this is your creation but each one of them see
Bob Ross,here now once again right here we need to have another shadow there we go and all the time this is mixing with that beautiful color thats underneath it allows all kinds of things to happen now lets
Bob Ross,take a clean dry two inch brush and im going to gently gently tap following the angles and the mountain always follow your angles and tap more down here at the base than you do up here up here you
Bob Ross,just barely want to whisper it down at the bottom you want to tap it a little bit harder if you begin collecting some paint on your brush just take beat the devil out of it and that will remove the
Bob Ross,excess paint right off your brush without going through a lot of cleaning there we are see how soft thats beginning to look over here you follow these angles always pay attention to the angles in
Bob Ross,your mountain and thats what youre looking for there now then very gently lift upward this takes out all those little tap marks softens blends creates the illusion of mist just like so and that easy
Bob Ross,you have one fantastic mountain big sign of a gap there you go mountain there okay now we can play some more lets find us a fan brush i think well just go right into this mixture we had before we
Bob Ross,made the mountain with it its black uh phthalo blue little van dyke brown just mix them on the brush load that brush full of paint look at all the paints in there okay lets go back up here maybe
Bob Ross,theres some happy little trees live back here these are far away and all were looking for is just little indications little evergreens that are far far back in the distance far away there we go okay
Bob Ross,lets get a little more paint so youre using the top part of that brush and just tap downward thats all there is to it thats all there is to it now you dont want to kill all this misty area you
Bob Ross,kill this mist its right up here all thatll happen is these trees will run right into the mountain you want them to stay separated so dont kill your misty area save them theyre precious theyre
Bob Ross,good friends right here in this mountain area they may be your best friends so cherish them there we go so now if you get these too far apart theyre going to begin looking like fence posts so if you
Bob Ross,if your little evergreens that are far in the distance begin looking like fence post chances are you just dont have enough add a few more and see if it doesnt doesnt help take care of that little
Bob Ross,problem there we go not easy we got some happy little evergreens living back here in the distance all the way across yeah then we can take another fan brush and i have i have several of them going
Bob Ross,here so i dont have to dont have to continually wash them we take a little blue and white this was just a little the shadow color is left over lets go up here i want to just pop in some indication
Bob Ross,of some happy little tree trunks just on the bottom touch it pull it straight up just touch pull straight up very lightly very lightly just enough to create a little little light area down here at the
Bob Ross,base of these trees just makes them a little prettier so youre playing light against dark dark against light continually continuing thats what paintings all about now baby baby we back here in the
Bob Ross,distance we can start playing with a little detail well take that same old black color just put a lot of paint in the brush just black blue a lot of paint look at there that brush is really full okay
Bob Ross,lets go right up in here and well just pop in a few little little bushes dont want to kill all the little little tree trunk areas that you made there just a few see that little light area now is
Bob Ross,your separator its your divider there just like so now then ill go back to this fan brush its got mainly white on it okay tell you what im going to do im going to add at least a little touch of
Bob Ross,the liquid white to it to make it a little thinner just go back up here now then i want some i want some bright things happening here so im going to take this and begin pushing upward to create just
Bob Ross,some happy little grassy areas back here allow it to mix with that color its underneath all the blues and blacks and sun creates all kinds of little things there we go maybe it comes right along in
Bob Ross,there wherever you want it maybe theres one out there well have this one go up just sort of make a decision let it happen now then lets take a two inch brush and im just going to tap it into a
Bob Ross,little of the titanium white just just gently tap it you see okay lets go up here now i want a happy little reflection to live right underneath here all you need is white because the color is already
Bob Ross,on the canvas just pull it straight down straight down and start where you want to be the brightest and then work outward in both directions and automatically itll get darker as it works away from
Bob Ross,that area now with a clean brush and pull it down firmly like so just pull it straight down and then go lightly across look at that look at that okay yeah then im gonna take a little bit of liquid
Bob Ross,white and a little bit of titanium white and mix it together pull it out flat get a little roll of paint on the knife tiny little roll there it is and lets go up here and just put the indication of a
Bob Ross,little snow its laying right along the base of that and just barely touching the canvas just barely touching and allow it to mix with that colors underneath dont fight these let them just let them
Bob Ross,happen there we are okay now maybe tell you what lets play a little the blue and the black on the fan brush maybe right here theres an evergreen thats a little bigger hes a little touch closer and
Bob Ross,well drop him in right there just like that and he lives right out there well give him a little friend we dont want to be lonely hes just sitting right here watching the northern lights or
Bob Ross,borealis whatever you want to call it easier to say northern lights im going to take a little touch of that blue and white mixture loaded on the fan brush and come right along here and just put the
Bob Ross,indication of a few little highlights these trees are far away i dont want too many if you get too many just take your dark paint go right back over them itll eat it right up all right all right now
Bob Ross,then lets have some fun lets put in some bigger trees same old color just use the blue and black mix it well okay lets go right up here maybe yep i see a big tree that lives right there start with
Bob Ross,just the corner of the fan brush work it back and forth back and forth and as you work down the tree add more and more pressure down here youre getting tough oh youre really taking out all your
Bob Ross,frustrations down here there we go just and bang it in there and maybe theres another tree here see start with a corner back and forth back and forth see i think everythings like people ive made so
Bob Ross,many fantastic friends with painting but i think everythings got to have friends trees and bushes and everything needs friends everybody needs a friend im going over the other side over here lets
Bob Ross,shoot lets get crazy i want one that goes way up and goes all the way through this northern light now theres as many different ways to paint northern lights as there are painters this is just one
Bob Ross,interpretation this is what they look like to me where i live it really makes a beautiful painting and these black canvases when you change the light source the painting changes you put this under
Bob Ross,three different lights and youd almost youd almost believe you had three different paintings it changes that much its almost unbelievable and at home try these black canvases with any transparent
Bob Ross,color now ive got letters that have asked me how to tell what color is transparent theres a very very simple test in fact i tell you what while the camera is right there ill show you take a color
Bob Ross,like blue bring the camera right in here so we can see see if you take this blue and rub it on here that still looks black that color is transparent now then lets take a color okay lets use bright
Bob Ross,red thats a very opaque color now when you put it there see what happens that color is not transparent it will not do for what were trying to do here thats a good test of course now we got a red
Bob Ross,spot on the canvas hey paint another tree trees cover up a multitude of sins well have another one yeah well put him right here hes right there there he is this is still the blue and the midnight
Bob Ross,black just blue and black okay im gonna get a one one-inch brush well use it for a little bit take that same color the blue and the black well grab a little bit of this lighter color and put it in
Bob Ross,there pull that brush in one direction load it full of paint its a very dark blue okay lets go ahead up here and maybe were going to have some happy little snow-covered bushes so all were doing is
Bob Ross,just beginning to lay in some of the very basic shapes youre not looking for detail yet only very basic shapes very basic okay lets go right over in here maybe theres a happy bush yep but its
Bob Ross,right there it comes right out or just wherever you want them wherever you want you can have as many or as few just just let your imagination take you if youve never been to alaska youre to go see
Bob Ross,it its almost unreal i was born and raised in florida i was almost 20 years old before i ever saw snow and my favorite uncle uncle sam he sent me up there in january i thought that would be funny it
Bob Ross,was funny i i got off the plane the first thing i did was stepped on the ice and fell on my bottom because i didnt know how to walk on ice now im taking some liquid white and going right into
Bob Ross,titanium white pull it in one direction well put a little tiny bit of blue in there one direction look at all the paint thats on that brush its really full okay lets go up here now then you begin
Bob Ross,picking out where all these little bushes live and just barely touch give it a little push and create all these little snow-covered bushes in alaska they have ice fog and ice fog occurs normally when
Bob Ross,its about 30 below or colder and it covers everything everything with frost it is so beautiful trees look like theyre in full foliage so beautiful and the light plays through it and these all these
Bob Ross,little ice covered frosty things they act like prisms and they break up the light and you see all colors in the trees in the dead of winter you can see just oh you have to go see it i cant cant
Bob Ross,explain it all to you so pretty but theres a nice push just grows right out of that brush and well put another one right there they go just drop them in just happy little bushes happy little bushes
Bob Ross,there well with the completion of this painting this will end the eighth joy of painting series its hard for me to believe that we have over 100 shows now over a hundred shows take a little blue here
Bob Ross,put a little highlight on these trees i really hope youve got to see all the shows if theres any of them that youve missed youd like to see them give your station a call let them know let them
Bob Ross,know what you want to see and when they need some help give them a hand there we are lets go over to this tree dont want him to be left out there just here and there dont kill all the dark contrast
Bob Ross,thats what makes it pretty and you know me i gotta have a little cabin in here so maybe with all this paint i have on here im gonna scrape out just the basic shape to get rid of that loose paint
Bob Ross,its also a good way to lay out your your initial cabin shape start with a little bit of van dyke brown and ill mix some dark sienna right in that just mix them together pull it across need a little
Bob Ross,front on that cabin a little bit right along here you know as were winding down this series id like to take just a minute and thank the people here at the television station we have one of the
Bob Ross,finest crews in the country and they they make some of these beautiful television shows and you never see them you may never they never get a thank you but if it wasnt for them there wouldnt there
Bob Ross,wouldnt be any show a little bit of brown and white here just to put some highlight on him give me a little door now then ill tell you what lets put some snow up here on his roof just like so and
Bob Ross,that gives us a quick little cabin we can just bring some snow right down like that see how easy that is lets put some snow over here on the other side of the roof we dont want that one to be left
Bob Ross,out put that wherever you want it okay maybe somethings coming there just like that see and pay attention to your angles when youre laying the snow in angles are very important very important there
Bob Ross,we go just put all kinds of little snow things here okay lets go back in here pick up some of the liquid wine go right into my titanium white hold the brush full and lets pop a few more little
Bob Ross,bushes right in work in layers completing the most distant part of your painting first and working forward just like so a few little bushy things over in here were on the verge of having a completed
