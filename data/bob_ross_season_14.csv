Bob Ross,hello Im Bob Ross and Id like to welcome you to the 14th Joy of Painting series first of all Id like to thank you for inviting me back for another series of painting shows if this is your first
Bob Ross,time with us then let me extend a personal invitation for you to get out your brushes and paint along I tell you what or just drag up the old easy chair and spend a relaxing half hour enjoying some of
Bob Ross,Natures masterpieces were were painting with about a dozen oil colors a few unorthodox brushes and each show Ill try to show you how easy it is for you to paint and how much fun it can be so I
Bob Ross,tell you what lets go on up here to the canvas and get started now Ive already covered the canvas with a nice thin even coat of liquid white the liquid white just makes the canvas wet and Slick it
Bob Ross,allows us to actually blend color right on the canvas and it really makes our painting much much simpler than traditional methods so I tell you what lets start out and have run all the colors across
Bob Ross,the screen that you need at home to paint along with me and theyll come across in the same order is I have them on the pallet starting with a white and working around and while theyre doing that
Bob Ross,lets go on up here and lets get started well do a lets just do a happy little scene today Ill show you a very simple scene that you can do and youll enjoy lets start off today with an old 2in
Bob Ross,brush and go right into right into a small amount of the phthalo blue doesnt take a great deal just a little and just tap a little color into the bristles by tapping that assures a nice even
Bob Ross,distribution of color all the way through the bristles there we go lets go right on up here now lets start right up at the top and we use little crisscross Strokes just making little xs and go all
Bob Ross,the way across the top see there that easy its all you have to do now the blue in your brush is continually continually mixing with the liquid white thats already on the canvas so that way it Blends
Bob Ross,automatically as you work downward and in a landscape it should always get lighter toward the Horizon that helps create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting there we go just little
Bob Ross,crisscross Strokes like so okay maybe about down like that now I thought today wed put a happy little cloud in the sky if youre going to put clouds in the sky then you might want to make your Sky a
Bob Ross,tiny bit darker so the clouds will stand out you need the dark in order for a light to to show against it there okay now very gently Ill just go all the way across and that just removes the brush
Bob Ross,strokes and brings everything together a that easy we have a we have a very nice little Sky tell you what while we have that blue on the brush Im going go right back into my phthalo blue and Im
Bob Ross,going to reach right next door here and grab the least little touch of the phthalo green very small amount doesnt take much its very strong very strong okay lets go back up here now maybe maybe
Bob Ross,well have a little water in this painting so start from the outside and pull inward pull it across like so pull across there we go see if you start here and go across it leaves a big distinct line
Bob Ross,which is very hard to blend out so come from the outside in and that way you dont have that distinct line and this little area thats left in here if everything works just right itll look just like
Bob Ross,a little Sheen of light coming across your water when youre all finished okay and you can take a little bit of this color and bounce it back up here in the sky if you have some left on the brush it
Bob Ross,doesnt matter the big thing that we try to teach you here is to enjoy what youre doing and to have fun painting should make you happy should make you happy okay lets wash the brush that might be
Bob Ross,the most fun part of this whole Technique we wash our brushes with odorless thinner shake them off have a box down here and I just shake the brush into the box and and beat the devil out of it now
Bob Ross,with a nice clean dry brush lets go right back over this and just blend it together the light spot will remain and your painting there you dont have to worry about it itll stay there and you can
Bob Ross,blend the sky to whatever degree that you want it okay now then thats thats just to knock off any excess paint this on the brush its easier than cleaning it we said wed have a a happy little cloud
Bob Ross,in this painting so well use a fan brush today you could do this with a oh with a 1-in brush or 2in brush I just picked up the fan brush so lets try that load a lot of the titanium white into it
Bob Ross,its a very firm paint and use just the corner of the brush and just make little circles just happy little circles little tiny circles see there little tiny circles there just let him hell float
Bob Ross,right on off the co right on off the canvas you have to make big decisions this piece of canvas is your world and you have to decide you have to decide where things live in your world because you have
Bob Ross,unlimited power here you can do anything that you want to do anything that you want to do there youre only restricted here by your imagination okay wash off our fan brush then I just dry the fan
Bob Ross,brush on a paper towel now back to our 2-in brush well take just the top corner and were going to blend the base of the clouds out tiny little circles using just the top corner of the brush then
Bob Ross,grab it and fluff it tease it pull it up a little and then very lightly very lightly three hairs and some air just go across and that easy you built a beautiful little Cloud same thing over here just
Bob Ross,the corner of the brush just to Stir It Up a little lift it lift it and then blend it there you go and that quick you have a couple of happy little clouds that live in your Sky lets build us a little
Bob Ross,mountain today for that Ill use some Prussian Blue well take a little midnight black some vany brown little Liz and Crimson what the heck what the heck main thing were looking for here is a good
Bob Ross,dark color pull it out as flat as you can get it just really really exert some Force go straight down with a knife there cut across and we get a tiny roll of paints right on the edge of the knife now
Bob Ross,then this is where you have to make a big decision where does your Mountain live maybe in our world our mountains going to live does now right there with a firm pressure firm pressure push that paint
Bob Ross,right into the fabric there we go just right into the fabric act like youre trying to push a hole through youre not going to hurt it its strong very strong okay now then maybe theres another
Bob Ross,little bump there and you decide wherever you want scrape off all the excess paint you can hear how hard Im scraping there really get in there and get tough with it there we go now well take our
Bob Ross,2-in brush and we want to grab it and pull it Im still applying a great deal of pressure here grab it pull firmly downward that helps create that illusion of mist at the base of your Mountain there
Bob Ross,we go see there thats all theres to it just give it a pull and by using the shadows and highlight shapes here that are created by the brush you can lay out your entire Mountain without ever being
Bob Ross,committed there we go see you just lay them out and change them and move them thats a super way to to cheat a little bit and theres no such thing as cheating and painting if it works for you and it
Bob Ross,makes you feel good then its just right there we are lets wash the brush take it off there we are we have the strangest strangest looking cameraman in television all of them have these weird colored
Bob Ross,freckles Im going to take just titanium white pull it out flat take cut across and once again our small roll of paint its so important to load that knife correctly go right up here touch no pressure
Bob Ross,no pressure there just let the knife float just let it float right right down the side of the mountain but no pressure If you apply a lot of pressure its going to look just like youre icing a cake
Bob Ross,youre not going to have all this this breaking in here the holes left in it the other problem that people experience a great deal is they use a paint thats too thin if you use a thin paint its just
Bob Ross,going to turn to mud and then youre going to be unhappy with me and I really I really want this to work for you get a paint its very dry and very firm thats most most important there now then
Bob Ross,before we get too far along get carried away here lets put a little shadow in there Ill just take a little bit of the little bit of blue little blue little white there just mix it like so pull it
Bob Ross,out once again our little roll of paint Thats so important now go right up in here no pressure once again no pressure let that knife just float see there and we put this Shadow color in the opposite
Bob Ross,or opposing direction from the Highlight now maybe right up in here there see there isnt that fantastic that you can build a mountain that easy and you really can really can every day I get letters
Bob Ross,from people all over the country who never never in their lives suspected they could paint such beautiful paintings and just from watching the different shows that weve put on theyre doing fantastic
Bob Ross,Works absolutely fantastic and the more you practice the easier it becomes and the better you get if theres a secret to this style of paint or any style of painting its practice thats all theres
Bob Ross,no big Mysteries here we show you how to do it all you need to do is just practice a little okay make sure your brush is good and dry and now we want to help create that illusion of mist down here all
Bob Ross,were doing is tapping just tapping following the Angles and lifting upward see there just tap just the base of it and give it a little little upward lift over here follow these angles there now
Bob Ross,sometimes you can take have a little fun maybe you take a little blue on the brush now watch here look at the power you have you can bring that mountain right around see there you can make it go right
Bob Ross,around corners and it helps create a little more interest in your mountain of course were not interested in that happy book but if youre out Selling paintings this is this is what whatll sell your
Bob Ross,painting is these little extras makes your painting special there we go see it created another plane in that mountain brought it forward and you can do all kinds of little tricks like it just practice
Bob Ross,a little bit in just a few days you wont believe you just absolutely wont believe what you can do okay lets go back to my old fan brush Im gonna go right into this old dark color that I used to to
Bob Ross,make the mountain lets see that was some black and some Prussian Blue and some van Dy Brown there we go I tell lets add a little sap green to that too what the heck there we are okay load the brush
Bob Ross,full of paint both sides full of paint and maybe back in here theres some little trees that live far away theyre theyre happy little trees that live in the distance there so take the brush and all
Bob Ross,you have to do is tap down see there if you can see that all right now then we just you have to make some decisions here where do they live where do they live in your world this is one of the easiest
Bob Ross,nicest most effective ways that Ive ever ever seen to make the indication of a lot of little trees that live far away even if You never painted before certainly this is a snap you can do this there
Bob Ross,and there we are maybe look at there look at there there they come when youre painting in this technique you just sort of you let your imagination go just let your mind wander because you can create
Bob Ross,any illusion that you want just let your mind think of things and and off you go there see and Im tapping quite firmly here firly tap you know at the beginning of the show I said something about drag
Bob Ross,up your old easy chair and relax with me I had a letter from a fantastic lady and she told me each week when the show comes on in her area she drags up her old easy chair and shes going to sit and
Bob Ross,watch the show and every week without fail she falls asleep and she says by the time she wakes up I finished the painting and go left her there in a chair by herself but you know whether whether you
Bob Ross,awaken refreshed or you paint along with us either way I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoy being here with you there all Im doing here is taking that color and pulling it straight down to create
Bob Ross,a little reflection knock off the excess paint and go gently gently across and we have instant Reflections now Ive got several fan brushes going here so I dont I dont have to spend all my time
Bob Ross,washing them so Im going to go to well take a little yellow reach up here get a little sap green load the brush full of color a lot of color go right back up here maybe back in here theres some
Bob Ross,little grassy areas that live just take give it a little upward push bend the bristles push upward see there there and we can make just the indication of some little grassy things that live back here
Bob Ross,in the distance wherever you want them there just all kinds of little projections you can touch a little yellow ochre here and there little Indian yellow whatever okay now then lets take our knife a
Bob Ross,little touch of the liquid white Im going to put it on the canvas or on the pet there we go and cut across it like that lets go right up here and with that lets just cut in the indication of a
Bob Ross,little water line just wherever keep these lines basically straight or it look like you look like your waters going to run right off the side of the canvas we dont want that to happen see how you
Bob Ross,can create all kind of little little places where the this is where the big trout hides back in here there and when youre painting make up little stories in your mind think about think about the big
Bob Ross,fish that lives here and maybe maybe this is in the far north maybe theres a little Beaver that comes along here and has fun just make up little stories and yes people might think youre a little
Bob Ross,touched but painters are allowed theyre allowed to be different so enjoy that it really helps your painting if you if in your own mind thats your world and you can relate to it there we go Im
Bob Ross,mixing up a big bunch of dark here the same things the blue black brown little Crimson you know same colors lets just stay with the old fan brush day you could once again you can do this with any
Bob Ross,brush load a lot of paint into it lets go back up here maybe in our world There lives a big evergreen tree just start off by touching the canvas now just a corner the brush and just sort of let this
Bob Ross,work back and forth see there once again you can do this very nicely with a 1 or 2 in Brush bringing it to a chisel Edge it works just as well I just had a dirty fan brush so thought Id use it today
Bob Ross,there but its up to you totally totally up to you there we go fan brush maybe it puts more detail into it there now then load the brush again a lot of paint and it should be very very dark you need
Bob Ross,were going to put some highlights on there so you need this to be dark to the highlights so show lets give him a friend you know me if youve painted with me before I think everything needs a friend
Bob Ross,"even the trees and the bushes and everything friends are that important there we go okay right on down I Ive painted probably oh 20 30,000 paintings now and Im still fascinated its still it gets"
Bob Ross,you excited to see how how it works and you have to try it to understand there we go there we go see just back and forth back and forth think about the little limbs on this tree leave some leave some
Bob Ross,places in here for the for the birds to sit birds have to have a place to sit all right all right okay just in here we can do anything we want just cuz were going to separate all that with with
Bob Ross,highlights brush is too slow lets get Lets Get Serious lets take the old 2in brush and go right through that same color pull the brush in One Direction One Direction Through the paint by pulling it
Bob Ross,in one direction itll round one corner and that rounded Corner we want to the top take with the rounded Corner up give it a little push and watch here see when you push look at all those little
Bob Ross,leaves and grass indications and Bush indications it makes just automatically there we go now turn the brush to create shape there see there think about each individual Bush give them names if you
Bob Ross,want to theres one named Martha and theres Fred whatever it takes but each one of these is an individual with his own personality begin thinking about him building his shape there and as I say
Bob Ross,people may look at you like youre a little little different but thats all right us painters as you know were happier than most people so its okay its okay now then Im going to go back to my fan
Bob Ross,brush and Im take some sap green a lot of sap green a little bit of the yellow okay lets go lets go right up here now then Im just going to take just use a corner of the brush and put in the
Bob Ross,indication here and there of some highlights not too much I want these trees to remain quite dark quite dark dont want to lose that contrast and the mountain shows that your lights coming from the
Bob Ross,right so put more emphasis on the right side of this tree there we go darker darker darker as it works down because of theres more Shadows toward the bottom of the tree plus that the old limbs are
Bob Ross,not as bright and shiny as the new ones there just right into nothing now maybe maybe we want the indication here and there of some sticks and twigs now this is all you have to do is just take the
Bob Ross,knife scrape right through the paint allow some of the canvas to show through now most of this most of these little Twigs will be covered up when we get finished but the ones that show through here
Bob Ross,people will think you work for weeks with your little one haired brush putting all that detail in there and thats our secret we dont tell them any different okay maybe a couple over here wherever
Bob Ross,you want them just sort of just sort of make a decision and drop them in lets use the old 1in brush today well put some highlights in here one of our golden rules a thin paint will stick to a thick
Bob Ross,paint so we start with the thickest paint imaginable when we when we put it on the canvas now when I start highlighting this I want a thinner paint these yellows are made to a thinner consistency
Bob Ross,intentionally so theyll stick easy I even dip the brush into a small amount of the liquid white to thin the paint even more pull this in One Direction load a lot of paint look at the end of this
Bob Ross,brush brush look at all the paint thats in there probably the most common mistake made is not putting enough paint into the bristles a lot of color a lot of color its heavy you can feel it okay
Bob Ross,lets go right up here now you have to start making big decisions in here pick out individual bushes and stuff and trees okay give a little push gentle it does not does not take a hard hit if youve
Bob Ross,loaded the brush correctly with a nice thin paint then all you you have to do is just touch and it wont turn to mud on you see there one individual Bush all right you got it now you got it now there
Bob Ross,we go now begin picking them out one at a time one at a time there they come there they are Im going to pick up some Indian yellow and maybe right on the tip of the bristles a little touch of the
Bob Ross,bright red and we can put a bush out here that has little red flowers on it see there that easy you can do anything out here anything one Bush at a time there we go see we got the ones that are
Bob Ross,fathers away first now we can come back and begin putting some that are closer to us working layers doing the most distant object first and working forward always working forward there we go layer
Bob Ross,after layer I tell you what tell you what look at that lets have some fun maybe in our world here theres a big old trout lives out here you got to have a way to go get him so lets build us a little
Bob Ross,path and for that well take the knife a little touch of Van Dy Brown pull it out very flat cut across and our little roll of paint again always that little roll of paint and go right up here you have
Bob Ross,to make a big decision now wheres your path live maybe it comes right around and all Im do is just applying some brown paint to put the general basic shape of the path in allow it to get larger and
Bob Ross,larger and larger as it gets closer to you thatll make it look like theres distance there lets take some dark Sienna little bit of white mix that up but dont over mix it just sort of leave it a
Bob Ross,little marbly looking see there all different colors our little roll of paint again go back up here and barely touching just let it graze just let it barely graze see there let it graze oh just oh
Bob Ross,thats nice gives you cold chills that work so well there we are look at that see you can do that there we are lets take now then we want to push that path down to the painting there all you got to
Bob Ross,do is bring some of those bushes right over it okay now then lets go to the other side of the path maybe over here lives there he is its a happy little tree that lives right here and he hangs out
Bob Ross,right over the path he just lives here and sort of hangs out see now that path disappears back here in the bushes we dont know where it goes we dont know thats a private little place back there
Bob Ross,its where the little rabbit hides and he has fun Mr and Miss rabbit live there there that little Bush it hangs over right there right there and hes got a friend lives here like that there we are
Bob Ross,there okay now then we can take just a clean knife and just go around and scrape in the indication of some little Trunks and sticks and twigs and see there that helps show distance in your painting
Bob Ross,shows different planes and creates that illusion of depth so these really help now then take our liner brush put a little paint thinner on it maybe a little bit of the van Dy Brown we want this color
Bob Ross,to be as thin as ink lets go right up here maybe there lives just a little stick here and you can put few of these in wherever you want them see there just add a little excitement while I have that
Bob Ross,brush Im going to add a little bit of red and I think Ill sign this painting there we are thin paint as thin as ink and with that think well call this painting finished and from all of us here I
Bob Ross,really hope youve enjoyed it so happy painting and God bless Ill see you next time Music
Bob Ross,hi welcome back Im spending a few minutes here with my friend this is Mr Jay and hes a little blue jay and and he stays with me right now and thats one of the cutest little rascals watching there I
Bob Ross,thought you might enjoy seeing him but hes just a little baby little baby bird and I thought you might enjoy meeting him tell you what Im going to set him down and well go ahead and get started
Bob Ross,while Im doing that lets have him run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along today and Im just going to set him right over here there you go okay and while theyre running
Bob Ross,the colors across the screen lets go on ahead here and get started Im going to start out today take a tiny bit of the phthalo blue and I retry up here Ill be right back right back and get a little
Bob Ross,bit of a lizin crimson so I have phthalo blue and azarin Crimson there we go and you just mix these on the brush and lets go right up here thought today maybe wed just do a a happy little painting
Bob Ross,Ive already covered the canvas with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white so its all wet its ready so we can get started now just using little crisscross Strokes we can begin just putting in a
Bob Ross,happy little Sky a little more of the color there and Im just sort of varying the crimson and the blue proportionately so we have different mixtures some of its a little bit to the reddish side
Bob Ross,somes a little bit to the bluish side I want this to be a very soft little painting today very quiet very soft there we go and maybe right on over here just wherever you want them just putting some
Bob Ross,pretty little things in the sky still using little crisscross Strokes there a little more of the Crimson little more phthalo blue lets go right up in here there we go just put those in yeah down to
Bob Ross,about like so we really dont have to make any big decisions yet okay lets wash our brush and well scrub it with odorless thinner and theres a screen here in the bottom of my can that I scrubed the
Bob Ross,brush against that allows the solid materials to sort of settle to the bottom shake it off and just beat the devil out of it now then that brush clean has got to be the most fun part of the whole Tech
Bob Ross,te neque with a clean dry brush we can just blend this guy together thats continually mixing with the liquid white so all these beautiful little effects just happen automatically and you can just
Bob Ross,just blend it to any degree of lightness that you want the more you blend it the softer its going to become you sort of have to just make a big decision there just blend it still using the little
Bob Ross,crisscross Strokes like so okay then very lightly just barely touching we just go across that takes all the brush Strokes out and softens Blends everything together there now then tell you what lets
Bob Ross,have some fun go right back into the crimson and back over here to the the phthalo blue same colors and Im just mixing them on the brush just mix them right on the brush maybe theres some little
Bob Ross,little trees that live back here in the distance all you got to do is touch the canvas and just pull it down just touch pull downward see there theyre very light very subdued quiet little trees they
Bob Ross,just sort of decide where you want them to live and thats exactly where they are to live there we go see wherever you want them and it Fant fantastic that you can create a world that easy maybe maybe
Bob Ross,maybe right up here like so there hope you enjoyed my little friend hes hes quite a character hes little blue jay just a few weeks old on one of the earlier shows I had shown a robin that I raised
Bob Ross,and turned loose and a lot of people wrote and wanted to know how he was doing hes doing fantastic we turned him loose hes out living with all his friends now and in a few weeks were going to turn
Bob Ross,this little blue jay loose now Im going to take a clean brush I want to create the illusion of mist at the base of this so very firmly tapping with the top of the brush just tap this will create a
Bob Ross,very very soft Misty effect just tap it really get in there and tap it this is where you take out all your frustration and hostilities there its better than going home and arguing with your spouse
Bob Ross,see there just tap very firmly and then lightly lightly just lift upward and see how soft and Misty that becomes that quick there we are okay maybe maybe let me find a fan brush here theres one lets
Bob Ross,mix up a little bit more of that lavender here some blue lizard crimson and Ill just mix some of the knife be right back get a little bit of white I want to lighten that just a little bit maybe touch
Bob Ross,more of the Crimson there we go good good okay let me clean off my knife here okay Im put a little bit of it on the fan brush just work the brush back and forth and maybe back in here maybe right
Bob Ross,there maybe theres a happy little evergreen tree that lives right there and all you do is just work it back and forth were just let him fade right into nothing down here softer softer softer and we
Bob Ross,give him a friend however many trees you want dear whir thats exactly the right number there okay maybe tell you what dont want this side left out lets put one that lives right there just back and
Bob Ross,forth with a brush and we want it just to fade right into the Mist well come back and tap a little bit and make it even mistier I like these little Misty paintings sometimes youll find that
Bob Ross,paintings that are very soft and Misty maybe a little more difficult to do than ones that are bright and shiny but either way either way whichever kind of painting that you like and you want to do
Bob Ross,thats the right kind there okay now back to my 2-in brush and well gently tap this well just tap it and bring it right into nothing its very soft lift upward see they just sort of float around
Bob Ross,there in the Mist there okay tell you what oh we got that old brush Im going to take that same brush leave the the lavender color that we had on it and add a little bit of the vany brown same color
Bob Ross,lavender with a little bit of vany brown just to darken it up a little lets go right up in here maybe right over in here well just tap downward maybe theres a just a little group of trees that live
Bob Ross,right in here bushes and trees and all kinds of little things see there just let them work right on out to nothing there there we go can you can you hear Mr J over there still talking he thinks its
Bob Ross,lunchtime there we go okay and maybe theres a more distinct tree two in here same way there well give him another one like so its all there is to it all there is to it you can put as many or as few
Bob Ross,of these in your painting as you want now once again with our large brush I want to create that illusion of mist its very soft barely touching there now toward the the bottom of this you want to hit
Bob Ross,harder than up here up here Im not hitting very hard down here Im striking quite firmly like so there just really get in there and tap it and then once again lift very gently upward and maybe you
Bob Ross,want to put here and there the indication of a more distinct tree or bush maybe this a different kind of tree you you can still just use the top corner of this brush just put in see just tap it turn
Bob Ross,it so you build a general shape and you can create the illusion of any kind of little tree or bush that you want back here that easy there we go some of them you can just pull downward okay thats the
Bob Ross,other side of the brush is still pretty clean so we can tap it and once again create that illusion of mist there looks like its maybe early in the morning and the fog hasnt been burned off by the
Bob Ross,sunshine very soft shoot were having so much fun lets just keep on going here Im just going to take the old 2-in brush and tap it right into some of that same color just tap it like so okay now
Bob Ross,then maybe theres some land masses that live in here now you have to start making some big decisions where do your land live maybe maybe yep right along in there all were doing now is putting in a
Bob Ross,dark color so our light will show you need dark in order to show light know its sort of like sort of like life itself you need a little sadness in your life so you know when the good times come and
Bob Ross,its the same here you need a little dark so you know when the lights are there just let that come right down like that just layer after layer there we go yeah okay over here same way all Im doing
Bob Ross,once again is just blocking in a base color here just blocking it in I again put a bit more there okay see there already youre beginning to see the lay of the land though this this is good practice
Bob Ross,for when youre putting your highlights on okay lets go back over here and put a little more over in here there we are and that quickly we filled up this whole area now you could just paint it on but
Bob Ross,I find that it works better by tapping it so you can begin to make out all these little indications of the land flowing and moving here yeah there we go now then lets take and begin applying some
Bob Ross,highlights to that Ill just use the same old brush here go right into a small amount of the cad yellow and because it has all the blue and the lavender on it here when I touch the yellow its going
Bob Ross,to turn a beautiful green color and tap the brush like that tap it load some color into the bristles okay now then heres where we begin putting on all the little highlights the pretty part see there
Bob Ross,then all youre doing is just barely touching Im going to add a little bit of the yellow ochre and the Indian yellow maybe even throw in a little touch of bright red here and there as we paint along
Bob Ross,just to break it up and give it all kinds of beautiful little colors but in your world you sort of look at it and decide what you want there maybe over here there we go we dont want this side left
Bob Ross,out see there put all kinds of little things in there theres one wherever you want them to go just that easy okay but all youre doing here is tapping and the more you tap the softer this will become
Bob Ross,you can make it to where it absolutely just looks like velvet So Soft thats so pretty when you do it that way and at home you have more time than I do you can take your time and do something it looks
Bob Ross,much much nicer than this there okay just continually tap there this is very simple and Im sure youll enjoy it give it a try you I get and Ive said this before I get letters every week from people
Bob Ross,all over the country that tell me they have finally finally picked up the old brush and theyre painting some of the most fantastic paintings they never believed that they could do it and you really
Bob Ross,can you dont have to be blessed by Michelangelo at Birth you can paint all you need its a little bit of equipment somebody to show you how and thats thats our job we show you how and practice you
Bob Ross,do need to devote a little time to practice there we go if youre like most of us you didnt learn to tie your shoe on the first time you tried it and its the same here with practice itll get easier
Bob Ross,and easier there okay just bring it right on across like this there little touch of the bright red here and it will Sparkle this Rascal up just a little doesnt take much there see but already in this
Bob Ross,short of time looks like a Whole Meadow out here just very soft this would be a super place to take your shoes off and sort of just run through there barefooted and find you big old tree and sort of
Bob Ross,kick back and just just enjoy Gods Beauty there okay little bit right down in here like so but follow the lay of the land is most important here here that you follow the basic lay of the land and
Bob Ross,work from Back to Front forward forward forward all the time there okay all right now we can have some fun tell you what grab my knife here I think my friend Mr Js approving here hes over here
Bob Ross,squawking I dont know if you can hear him or not but hes sitting here with me yeah what you think huh okay he says were doing all right use the fan brush here well just well mix up some dark
Bob Ross,color we had some black and some Prussian Blue some vanc brown little touch of crimson lets go right up here maybe there lives back in our world here right there maybe theres just a happy little
Bob Ross,tree it lives right there see and just all were doing is tapping with a fan brush just give him a little tap and that makes those nice little fuzzy edges okay now then maybe theres a leaf or two out
Bob Ross,here on this tree there and all youre doing is touching and pushing downward here and use the shape of the fan brush to your advantage you probably noticed we use absolutely no patterns here I dont
Bob Ross,I I dont like to draw my my painting out because it gives you restrictions and then you have to stay in the lines shoot this is such a free form of painting that we just sort of start off and and go
Bob Ross,with it let it happen and within a very short time if you practice you learn to compose your paintings as you paint another question that Im asking continually is if we do any editing on these shows
Bob Ross,now I know some of the shows have editing we do not theres absolutely no editing here what you see actually happens in the time that you see it happen there see there with that easy you can make a
Bob Ross,happy little tree lets give him a lets give him another little friend right there just as many or as few as you want just give you a little practice and show you how to do them there okay decide
Bob Ross,where you want the little little limb to hang and how far they go drop them in back with our brush with a little bit of color on it little bit of the yellow and come down here and clean up his little
Bob Ross,foots like so there put a little dark color down here to indicate theres a little Shadow living under this tree there see there its all there is to it okay maybe lets get crazy lets have some fun
Bob Ross,today Im going to take the small knife a little bit of vanik brown and go right up in here and lets lets put some land in right in this little re recessed area here lets just scrub in a little bit
Bob Ross,of land and Im just using Straight vendik Brown just scrubbing it in using a quite a firm pressure here I really want this paint to be mashed right into the canvas looks like a little path out
Bob Ross,through there just sort of wanders around and you could make a beautiful little path there that easy if you wanted one once again painting is such an individual thing all we want to do here is show
Bob Ross,you how to do things want you do is totally up to you this is your world and you you create it the way that you want it and if you like it then its right and its good painting as I say over and over
Bob Ross,again painting should make you happy if it doesnt make you happy youre doing the wrong thing I spent half my life doing a job that I really didnt want to do and now now Im doing what I want to do
Bob Ross,and now work is fun and Ive met so many Fantastic people through the through The Joy of Painting and that may be the most fun at all Ive made friends that I gee I just I just never never dreamed and
Bob Ross,thats super there we go just put a little dark here and there okay now then let me find the fan brush okay well take a fan brush well go right into our yellows little bit of green load the brush
Bob Ross,full of color a little yellow ochre and lets go right up in here and lets just push in some happy little bushes that come right down in this little dirt area here just right down to the edges that
Bob Ross,sort of brings it together like so just brings it all together there now then now I have several fan brushes going so I dont have to spend all my time cleaning brushes Im tell you what were going
Bob Ross,to do here Im going to take a little liquid white on my fan brush and Im going to go right into some titanium white be right back I reach up here get the least little touch of phthalo blue so I have
Bob Ross,liquid white to make it thinner titanium white and a touch just a touch of phthalo blue load the brush full of color now back to our Golden Rule here a thin paint well stick to a thick paint so lets
Bob Ross,have some fun see we had a nice path up here now watch maybe look at there maybe in your world theres a little trickle of water that flows right down through here it makes just a bubbling little
Bob Ross,little waterfall little stream just let it play come right on down wherever you want it to go see there just let it go let it have fun there now the thin paint will stick right over the top of this
Bob Ross,thicker paint without it becoming mud now every once in a while you may have to stop wipe your brush off but thats okay overall youll get a a very nice effect here look at that just a little trickle
Bob Ross,of water is playing through the through the meadow here and its just having a good time tell you what lets have some fun maybe going to grab some vany brown on the fan brush tell you maybe yep right
Bob Ross,here lets just drop in a big tree bigger tree he lives right there little black little brown and onto that put in a few just a few leaves here and there as many or as few as you want shoot lets get
Bob Ross,crazy you know me I like these old Big Trees maybe right there be brave this is your bravery test just brown and black you dont have to be too careful here just just sort of knock it in tell you what
Bob Ross,oh we got that brush going lets put a tree on the other side come right over here with me and yep right here lives a big old tree see all youre doing is just firmly tapping there give him a big root
Bob Ross,down here now then I have another brush that we were using for the stream that has white on it so Ill take it and go right down the side and thatll make the highlight side of this tree and you can
Bob Ross,just blend that right together isnt that a sneaky way to make a beautiful little tree okay over here this one need some too just like so put the lightest on the edge and then blend it back lighter
Bob Ross,lighter lighter lighter Gentle Touch very gentle okay now then lets take some paint thinner little paint thinner on our liner brush we go right into some brown this should be thin oh just almost like
Bob Ross,ink lets go right up here maybe oh maybe theres a big old branch that hangs down right there got a little arm it comes out through here if you have trouble making your paint flow then its just not
Bob Ross,thin enough add some more thinner there okay few little things here and there wherever you want them couple over here like that the Old Clock on the wall tells me its about time to leave you for
Bob Ross,today as Im finishing this up Id like to thank you very much for being with me today I certainly hope youve enjoyed this painting hope you enjoyed meeting my little friend and well be back with
Bob Ross,you again so on behalf of the entire Joy painting staff Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless Music
Bob Ross,welcome back Im certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic painting with us super hope you got your paints out and youre all ready tell you what lets start out today and
Bob Ross,have run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us while theyre doing that come on up here and let me show you what Ive already done I have a black canvas up here today
Bob Ross,as you can plainly see and Ive covered this with black gesso now black gesso is designed to make the canvas black but then we let the black gesso dry completely and onto that Ive added oh weve
Bob Ross,taken some alzin crimson and phthalo blue mixture and weve just painted the whole canvas with it as weve worked out from the center Ive added a little more blue so it gets progressively darker
Bob Ross,toward the blue side as it goes out I hope all that makes sense its just leer and crimson and phthalo blue and weve covered the entire canvas all right and to that lets have some fun now I love to
Bob Ross,do these kind of paintings when were doing public demonstrations for example because people dont know that youve already put color on this black canvas and we use transparent color and you start
Bob Ross,off and all you do is put a little white on your brush and you go up to the canvas like so and you touch this canvas and all of these fantastic little colors just begin to happen and people think its
Bob Ross,magic they especially as I say if they didnt see you put anything on this canvas its really a super way to draw a crowd if youre out ever if youre ever out demonstrating publicly its a lot of fun
Bob Ross,and watch here maybe well just do like this just make little rocking Strokes lets just bring it right on around there we go like so and all Im using here is just straight titanium white nothing
Bob Ross,else just straight titanium white and you can create some of the most beautiful effects now if this is going to be our lightest area and I think in our painting they willll have that as our lightest
Bob Ross,area be sure theres nothing in the sky thats lighter than right here just like so okay just make all kinds of beautiful little effects and were not too worried at this point all were doing is just
Bob Ross,throwing in a little color well come back with a big brush and well smooth it all out and blend it together just putting in some color right now just enjoy there okay now you can do this with any
Bob Ross,transparent color that you want on this black gesso and sometimes I get letters and they say how do you tell if a color is transparent the easiest way I tell you what lets do it watch here let me let
Bob Ross,me take a little touch of bright red for example and bring the camera right up here now see if you if you put bright red on there it still looks red boys it look red now stay in that same spot let me
Bob Ross,take a little bit of this is phthalo blue and when I put it on here see it looks black thats how you tell if a color is transparent or at least transparent enough for our particular purposes there we
Bob Ross,go of course now I have a blue and red finger but thats all right now with a good clean dry brush and I cant stress enough that it be dry when you go up over this because if its wet has a little
Bob Ross,thinner on it youre going to mix all these up very gently making little crisscross Strokes very gently just begin blending this and you can blend it to any degree of lightness or darkness that you
Bob Ross,want because theres color on the canvas the more you blend this the darker its going to become there see there just like so and its unbelievable some of the Fantastic little things that you can
Bob Ross,make happen in a sky so easy its so beautiful way to do sunsets all you need is is to cover this with straight alizarin Crimson then put a little white or yellow on it you cant believe what happens
Bob Ross,oh Beau beautiful beautiful sunsets they just jump out at you okay lets have some fun today shoot every once in a while it its a lot of fun just to get a little bit crazy take a little bit of
Bob Ross,lavender that its made from phthalo Blue I reach up here and grab some lizard and Crimson just lavender color a little more Crimson into that there we go nice okay lets go right up here maybe right
Bob Ross,up in here lives lives in our world world use just the corner of the brush just a happy little Cloud right over this area right over it just a happy little Cloud floats around has fun just let your
Bob Ross,imagination go you dont have to be crazy to do this but as the old Sayan goes it helps does help there maybe that comes right on around like so however you want it another little thing right in here
Bob Ross,wherever wherever okay now then we go back to our 2in brush be sure its dry because if its not youre going to run into Agony City here and youre going to be upset with me and I want this to work
Bob Ross,for you barely touching it just grazing it just going to blend it a tiny bit and then were going to give you a bravery test very lightly just go over the entire thing just go right over it and that
Bob Ross,easy you have a fantastic little Cloud just laying up here in your sky and that particular cloud is just oh thats a perfect place we just use a find a clean brush that ones too dirty get a little
Bob Ross,bit of titanium white on my fan brush and you can do this with a 1in brush or whatever come right up in here grab this and just see let a little light just play right out of that touch it you need to
Bob Ross,do this fast though if you do it slow doesnt seem to work do you know how ever so often you can see the light R just slipping right out of the right out of a cloud that easy now then here Ill just
Bob Ross,take my finger and I go right around and Ill bring that dark back over part of it see how that pushes that light back and just brings that dark cloud right up there super super little way to make
Bob Ross,that work there a that easy that easy you got a fantastic little Sky okay tell you what lets build is a little mountain for that well take some black some black some bandake brown and lizard Crimson
Bob Ross,just mix it up like so take the knife cut off a little roll of paint so its right out edge of the knife okay now we had to make our first big major decision where does your Mountain live maybe in our
Bob Ross,world our Mountain just sort of lives right here wherever you want it to live there maybe theres a little bump there and it maybe it just comes down like that scrape off all the excess paint really
Bob Ross,get in there and really scrape hard youre not going to hurt this there okay let me wipe off my knife and well take a large brush and I want to grab that and pull it just grab it and Pull It downward
Bob Ross,there we are okay now then today lets have some fun lets take lets take we use titanium White go reach right up here grab some dark Sienna and just pull that through so its sort of marbled I dont
Bob Ross,want to over miix this a little touch of Van Dy Brown in there too but mostly dark Sienna and white let me wipe the knife off so you can see this very plain okay we have our paint pulled out very flat
Bob Ross,like that now take the knife and just cut across and get our little roll of paint that multitude of colors that you see here is also on the knife okay now then barely touching just let that touch and
Bob Ross,just slide right down there little bit right there right in there there okay we go right up in here at that pretty see there not that easy you can do it you can do it you can do anything and you need
Bob Ross,to believe that anything that you believe you can can do if you believe it sincerely and strong enough you can do it you can do it and I sincerely believe that I dont think theres any limit to your
Bob Ross,limitation add a little blue to that same color okay Im going reach you over here Im going to get the small knife I like that little knife and lets go right up in here little knife gets in these
Bob Ross,small areas sometimes better the big one and Im just going to put see there few little indications of some Shadows here and there just like so maybe well just sort of bring these around and see
Bob Ross,there put a little Valley right in there that easy over here you need a little something dont want that left out see and you can let a little this dirt spill over just use your imagination you you
Bob Ross,know to me painting painting represents freedom on this on this canvas you can do anything that you want to do anything that may be may be the nicest thing that happens Im going take a little lets
Bob Ross,take a little bit of white least least little touch of phthalo blue in it Im just making sort of a a light blue thats all Im looking for just light blue color Im going to sneak right in here just
Bob Ross,barely touching and maybe theres a tiniest little bit of snow thats laying down in this Valley lay a little color in there and then just barely give it a little pull let it sort of blend together
Bob Ross,snow is old and its dirty there but it makes a little light spot down in there okay back to our original Little colors here we can come right back in here just like so so see how you can create
Bob Ross,little valleys and just there watch watch theres one go back in here we need a shadow in between them like so and we can take our small knife and here and there we can drop back in some little dark
Bob Ross,edges boy thatll just make some Deep Shadows way back in there theres just no limit to the number of things that you can do and mountains teach you better than any other single thing how to use a
Bob Ross,knif if you can make mountains then you can create rocks and stones and buildings in some of the previous series weve painted entire paintings using nothing but the knife and thats a lot of fun that
Bob Ross,knife is its just spectacular if you let it work for you but its like everything else you need a devote a little time to practice with it and make it make it your good friend now then with a clean
Bob Ross,dry brush I want to very gently tap the base of this just gently gently tap like so see following the angles thats very important that you follow those angles there we go over here the angle are
Bob Ross,going this way so thats the way you tap when I tap the brush like that all Im doing is knocking off any excess paint that I picked up its easier than going through that whole cleaning procedure
Bob Ross,there why isnt that a son of a gun sticking up there its a nice mountain now then take a little more of that white on my fan brush and maybe you want this light some of it to Zing right across here
Bob Ross,now this really is your bravery test be very careful just barely barely touch see you can bring a little bit of that right across that mountain but please be careful here just barely barely graze it
Bob Ross,barely grazing okay lets take the onein brush lets have some fun 1 in Brush well go into some titanium white Im going be right back right back get a little bit of blue little bit of blue and
Bob Ross,titanium white okay now then lets go right up in here just blue and white maybe theres a little footy heill that lives right in here just a little Foothill all Im doing is tapping downward there
Bob Ross,see there just sort of decide how you want your Foothill to be shaped now you can also let me show you another way here like to show you as many possibilities use the corner of the brush and pull down
Bob Ross,that makes more rounded type things see it just sort of depends on what you want your world you can have ones that look more like Evergreens or you can have ones that look like rounded maybe these are
Bob Ross,maybe these are birch trees or Maple Tre well I dont know trees that are basically round on top its up to you in your world you have to make these kind of decisions there okay and well just tell
Bob Ross,you what maybe this just comes right on across like so like so there we are now then I want to once again create that illusion of mist Im going to take the large brush and just tap the base I like
Bob Ross,these nice soft Misty paintings there all youre doing is firmly tapping right at the base of this this is where you take out all your frustrations and hostilities really get in there socket like so
Bob Ross,and then lift very gently upward very gently okay lets have some more fun let me find there it is shoot when you get my age you start losing things couldnt find my fan brush for a second there use
Bob Ross,some Persian blue black Crimson just mix them together here good dark color here were looking for a color that looks black okay load a lot of color into the fan brush and maybe well put some distant
Bob Ross,little trees back in here and all Im going to do is just tap see the dark against the light youre always playing games with light and dark colors there dark against light light against dark thats
Bob Ross,what makes your painting stand out and look special there we go there there we go see there you can do it there thats a lot of trees did you ever believe you could do a whole Forest that quick you
Bob Ross,can there a lot of things that you justre theyre easy if you know how and we want to we want to show you how to make it work there we go okay now that Im going back to my fan brush that has the
Bob Ross,white paint on it or the light color can be light blue it doesnt matter whatever touch and pull gently up and itll give the indication of little tree trunks that are far far away far away and if you
Bob Ross,get one thats too bright just continue to rub it and itll pick up that dark color underneath there we go see there its all there is do it now then as I say theyre too bright all you have to do is
Bob Ross,just continue to rub them and theyll go away its all there is to it okay get me a clean paper towel here now then lets put some lets put some little grassy things in here so well just use this
Bob Ross,old dirty brush what the heck Im going to go right into the cad yellow and tap just tap I reach up here and get a little that dark green little sap green I want to darken that up a little bit dont
Bob Ross,want it too bright just tap but see you go down and let it slide a little Im exaggerating but thats what were doing when we tap so that theres theres paint right on the tip of those bristles now
Bob Ross,then maybe theres maybe theres a happy little Meadow right in here watch here all you have to do is just just tap and you can begin creating a beautiful little soft Meadow that lives back in here
Bob Ross,and look how it stands out stands out pretty okay there we are just let it go I want it a little bit darker there thats it and then start in the back and work forward forward forward always working
Bob Ross,forward at that super there and this this tapping with it with a brush to make this grass this is one of the neatest little effects that weve came up with its so easy I I know we have so many
Bob Ross,questions about it just the other day in our newsletter I wrote a long article about how you do this and how you make it work because so many people have written they like this and it just didnt in
Bob Ross,time in a in a 30 minute show to answer all the questions though I do try here we go all right I was talking to a fellow the other day and asked him I said whats your religious orientation he says
Bob Ross,what I said whats your church preference he says red brick so sometime sometimes its good just to have fun there okay but see how this is creating layer after layer of little grassy areas just like
Bob Ross,so okay and on this black background here boy that just shows up like crazy its beautiful and you dont have to put any base color down because the black is already there your dark color is already
Bob Ross,there sneaky I love these black canvases they create some of the most Striking Effects imaginable there we go okay shoot lets really have some fun you know me and my big trees I like big trees and
Bob Ross,paintings but when youre painting at home if you dont want a big tree in your painting leave it out or if you dont want a mountain in your painting or if you want two mountains or three it doesnt
Bob Ross,matter you add or subtract to make your world this is that same color same color that I was using tell you what maybe maybe theres a little tree that lives over here somewhere right here just a small
Bob Ross,little tree sort of back in the background there he is little Evergreen and we can put an arm or two on him it just sits out here in the sun has fun see there happy little tree happy little tree
Bob Ross,somebody wrote me one time they said everything in your world seems to be happy absolutely there enough sorrow in the world shoot you can just watch the news if you want to see bad stuff in this world
Bob Ross,here everythings happy now then maybe right down here toward the base I want to put the least little indication of a little highlight coming striking from there just a little highlight dont want
Bob Ross,much take my brush here tap in a little touch of that color around his foots wearing business shoot that was fun lets do another one vanak brown just use a lot of vanak brown here lets go right over
Bob Ross,here maybe on this side maybe theres a big tree I mean a big big old tree and hes all gnarly and bent and oh hes had a hard life hes like me hes been kicked around and beat banged oh poor old
Bob Ross,tree poor old tree there we go see there give him some character shoot oh straight trees arent always the most interesting I like them old trees and boy they look like theyve been stone or something
Bob Ross,when they were little okay now we can just take a little white little white little bit of little bit of dark Sienna lets go right back up here and lets just this is our light source right here so
Bob Ross,lets just come right along in here and lets put a little bit of light right out here on this Edge see just tap him in just tap him in there and as you work back use less and less pressure so it gets
Bob Ross,darker darker darker and it makes that tree look round see there there we go gives him some roundness not just a flat old tree out here see we give him a root that comes on out here we dont know
Bob Ross,where he goes we dont even care there little bit of grass right around the bottom his little foots big foots just Big Foot okay now I take my liner brush dip it in some paint thinner go right into
Bob Ross,the Van Dyk Brown I want this paint to be thin like ink almost water consistency all right lets have I dont want to cover up this area thats thats the prettiest part of the painting or I hope it
Bob Ross,will be but we can have a Lim or two thats getting close see now if you have trouble making this paint flow just this means that you dont have your paint thin enough add a little more paint thinner
Bob Ross,to it itll flow itll flow there maybe theres one H right there see wherever you want them wherever you want them this one here maybe comes around maybe bends comes right on around this way tree
Bob Ross,limbs just grow every which old way there and we dont want them all just projecting from the side there some of them as I say come around in front of the tree somewhere behind just H H there we go
Bob Ross,see there there we are boy thats thats a rough looking old tree hes had a heck of a life and take a little bit of light color here this this is a little bit of the phthalo blue and white and just
Bob Ross,here and there here and there add a little touch of highlight so you can see a little light striking up through here yeah then lets take our number three fan brush Im going right back in that same
Bob Ross,old dark color I think that was some pruss and blue some black some brown some Crimson okay lets go back up here now here and there maybe this old tree just push upward maybe this old tree has a few
Bob Ross,few old limbs hanging around here just a few there we go see most of them are gone cuz I dont want to lose that area here and there theres a few okay Ill wash it brush out Im going to go right
Bob Ross,into white and once again theres a little let phthalo Blue left in it just a cool color lets go right back up here and Im just going to push in the indication of a little highlight here and there
Bob Ross,boy is that something look at that Rascal Sparkle now then tell you what lets have some fun I love these bring the camera right up here so you can see the whole thing and I have contact paper on here
Bob Ross,and watch what happens when I take this off isnt that fantastic thats one of the most super little ways of making a striking painting that Ive ever seen and with that Im going to take a little red
Bob Ross,on my liner brush stand it down we going to ass sign this one and were going to call it finished I really hope youve enjoyed it these ovals are fantastic and youll have a lot of fun with them from

Bob Ross,here in the studio this is something brand new to him and he said look here you know something huh there yeah oh easy easy hell swallow your whole finger if youre not careful tell you what lets
Bob Ross,have run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and Ill put him over here and well get started here you go you set over here there all right I hope you enjoy seeing
Bob Ross,these little rascals as much as I like showing them to you these things are are really my friends and I enjoy the birds and we have a lot of we have a lot of fun together so I tell you what today
Bob Ross,lets do a happy little winter scene just something thats got some snow in it and show you a nice easy way to make a very effective scene lets start out with a little bit of phthalo blue on the 2-in
Bob Ross,brush just a tiny amount tiniest amount reach right up here get a little touch of the midnight black so we have black and blue or blue and black whatever your preference okay lets go right up in here
Bob Ross,now Im just going to Just Bounce in some happy little Sky areas here just sort of let them play and have fun like so for the time being Im going to leave some areas open well come back and well
Bob Ross,blend some of this into it but right now Im just going to leave that open there we go all kinds of little things just let them bounce and play in there there theres some right along in there
Bob Ross,wherever you want them and the and the black in here will add a little mood to it it will make it a little darker a little little depressed you know winter sometime its cold and so the more black it
Bob Ross,you put in with your blue the more gray itll become and the colder and the dreier itll look so if you want to make a painting thats very very dreary looking add quite a bit of the black color you
Bob Ross,want to be a little brighter then add more of the blue there okay well just wipe the old brush off down here there its a good way to clean the brush off and I might have a little bit of water down
Bob Ross,here just wipe the brush off we dont really care right now well put some snow down here so this will just become shadows in the snow the canvas was covered with liquid white when we started so this
Bob Ross,is mixing with the liquid white and it Blends beautifully if you were on a dry canvas itd be very difficult to do this okay let me wash my brush and as you know we wash our brushes with odorless
Bob Ross,thinner shake off the excess and cover the whole studio now with a clean dry brush Im going to very gently just begin picking up a little discolor and let it blend right into the liquid Whit thats
Bob Ross,on the canvas here begin smoothing it all out the basic shapes will remain in here there didnt that super its very very pretty very soft very soft there but its a fantastic and easy way to make a
Bob Ross,beautiful beautiful little Sky there we go okay and very lightly just blend out the brush strokes and if you want to create the in the illusion of individual clouds just some of the color you picked
Bob Ross,up just tap it on and then give it a little blend all right that easy we have one fantastic little winter Sky okay I tell you what Im going to into a touch of the van Dy Brown same old dirty brush
Bob Ross,got VC brown black a little touch of the phthalo blue and all Im going to do is just just work a little color right into the bristles black brown little blue its all there is to it and maybe way
Bob Ross,back here in the distance theres just the indication of a little bit of little little Foothill showing way back here were just going to see a small amount of it just want the indication of some
Bob Ross,trees that are growing far far away this is so far away you just barely can see them just let them disappear almost into absolutely nothing now then this is where the old Big Brush really comes in
Bob Ross,handy cuz you can do fantastic things in a very short period of time lets take just plain straight titanium white nothing else just titanium white okay right up here I have to make a big decision
Bob Ross,its going to be snow on the ground wheres your snow going to lay I think its going to be right about there see there all you do is just pull that easy and then begin blending working it together
Bob Ross,see this blue underneath you leave areas and they become the Shadows there is that fantastic I used to labor over winter pictures theyre so easy all you need is a big brush firm paint little
Bob Ross,imagination some practice and you can do anything anything that you want to do here dont be afraid of it experiment experiment go out on a limb once in a while remember thats where the fruit is its
Bob Ross,out there on the end of the limb so you have to take a chance once in a while when you painting there and the more you experiment the more you learn the the better you get and the more confidence you
Bob Ross,get inside and thats when its fun thats when you truly truly experience the Jo of painting Im using a little brown little black touch of the blue touch of the lizard crimson and just tap the
Bob Ross,bristles firmly Im just tapping the color right into the bristles and we have to begin making some major decisions here maybe theres going to be some big trees here that oh maybe they hang over
Bob Ross,lets just do it and see what happens maybe right here use just the corner of the brush see see and just begin tapping you have to make a decision where these things live and then begin tapping I
Bob Ross,always start at the base and work upward that way your darkest Shadow color is always on the bottom there see is that a pretty little Bush just using the corner of the brush this old Big Brush will do
Bob Ross,fantastic things if you just give it a chance theres a tree this ones a little bigger Maybe maybe this maybe its this ones big brother he lives right there like so see just however tall you want
Bob Ross,him to be few little things there begin thinking about the lay of the land I want the land to sort of go downward like that sos add a little more color some black brown shoot lets put some dark c in
Bob Ross,there too dark Sienna little touch of the blue not much blue lets go over in the other side side we need a big tree over here too once again using just the corner of the brush all you do is just tap
Bob Ross,just with a corner see its all there is to it now that begin working on basic shapes begin thinking about your shapes form its very important when youre doing trees and bushes one of the things I
Bob Ross,always tell students when Im teaching is remember that your friends the little birds have to have a they have to have limbs out here to set on so when youre shaping your tree give them a place to
Bob Ross,sit think about them think about them there let this tree just climb right on up in here Im going to start adding the least let me say that again the least little touch of yellow ochre well just
Bob Ross,brighten this up just but the least little touch dont want much of that I just want to give a little lightness to these limbs we out here at least little amount there we go look at that that quickly
Bob Ross,you can build all these fantastic little trees and bushes just using the corner of a big old brush okay a little more of a color on the brush go right back in here Once Again Begin thinking about the
Bob Ross,lay of the land its becoming very important to us now there okay at that fun a little more of the color dark Sienna black little touch of blue brown maybe shoot you why not lets put another big
Bob Ross,tree over here I want to sort of close this in and bring it together and maybe in your world you want a different comp composition one of the things that I recommend to people once you learn the basic
Bob Ross,technique which will take you a very short period of time take two or three of the scenes out of our books or something and combine them into one scene make a new scene you can take a tree out of this
Bob Ross,painting and a bush out of that one and oh building out of one Whatever combine them together and make entirely new scenes and they become original compositions Im putting a little more of that
Bob Ross,yellow ochre in there there but dont be afraid to experiment boy thats really thats really where the fun comes in there we are see that old trees just sort of hanging over and it just sort of
Bob Ross,brings this whole composition together to a little more of the black and the brown there we are all Im doing now is putting a dark base color on so our lighter colors will show were going to
Bob Ross,highlight that like this there snow on it okay super super let me find my little liner brush we go into some paint thinner Im going into vany Brown let me get a little more thinner on the brush we
Bob Ross,want this to be thin like ink or water very thin very thin turn that brush and then pull it out and bring it to a nice sharp Point liner brush has very long bristles on it okay now we can go back in
Bob Ross,here and just begin putting the indication here and there of a few little little tree trunks in here need something to hold up these trees dont want them to fall over make a Big Splash in the snow
Bob Ross,there I lived in Alaska over 12 years and the snow is so beautiful there its cold H boy is it cold but so beautiful there we are see we can just make lets go on the other side over here and then
Bob Ross,these little sticks and stuff we can just put all kinds of happy little things some of them maybe come right on out wherever you want them there we go now for these larger ones let me find a fan brush
Bob Ross,here shoot that little brush is nice but sometimes its too slow Im just going to go in to Van Dy brown with a fan brush just work some right into the bristle see both sides lets go up here and then
Bob Ross,I want a a nice strong trunk in this tree if you dont make that little noise it wont work okay maybe its got another arm here like that look at there look at there see that quickly you got a
Bob Ross,beautiful little tree trunk lets go on the other one here lets give him some arms maybe it comes goes right off the canvas and I sort of have these leaning inward so it leads the eye into the
Bob Ross,painting there maybe over here theres another one and we can go back to our liner brush and our thin paint and we can put a little bit of detail into some of these there we go theres one lives right
Bob Ross,there just a few here and there where you think they should be thats exactly where they should be paintings as individual as there are painters many different ways to do it any way that you want to
Bob Ross,do it lets go over here have a few there see if you have trouble making your paint flow add more paint thinner there we go Im going to put some highlights on these so going to cover up most of these
Bob Ross,little sticks and twigs and limbs that were putting in here so we dont have to worry about them too much but a few will show and we want them to look good wash my brush now then Im going back to my
Bob Ross,2-in brush were going to start making some big decisions Im going to go right up here and grab the least little touch of a lizin crimson oh the least little touch just want a tiny amount of pink and
Bob Ross,Im going to decide here that maybe the snow comes right along there see Im going pull it right across there you go by cat see there allow it to pick up some of that dark color that becomes shadows
Bob Ross,in your snow and its very pretty there we go maybe over here wherever you want it there see let it sort of sneak right up in between those trees here it comes down there look at there you just make
Bob Ross,all kinds of happy little things that easy that easy okay now then lets have some fun let me find theres one a nice 1in brush Im going to touch it to a small amount of the liquid white go right
Bob Ross,into my titanium white least little touch of azarin Crimson on it least little touch now Im going to tap it like so see give it a little tap and a push all right lets go right up here I want to put
Bob Ross,the indication up here of some beautiful little snow covered highlights up in here there think about form and shape dont just hit it random now dont hit it random there see there let all these
Bob Ross,little things just happen just let them happen there there look at that is that fun remember though that a thin paint will stick to a thick paint so thats the reason we put the little bit of liquid
Bob Ross,white in with the titanium white just to thin it down some that way itll stick right on top without it all mixing together if the paints are both the same consistency youre going to run into
Bob Ross,problems if the paint on your brush is thicker than whats on the canvas youre going to run into big problems cuz all that happens then is it pulls the paint off the canvas onto your brush and you
Bob Ross,become a Mud Mixer and then youre unhappy with me there maybe theres a little Bush that lives right in Music there grab a little touch more of the Crimson there we go there he is see a little bit
Bob Ross,of crimson will help separate make all these little bushes individually give them names make them friends whatever it takes nothing wrong with talking to your little bushes there over here lets put
Bob Ross,some highlights right on this little tree dont want this little guy left out there we are see there okay let the light play through there and make him Sparkle in the sun everybody wants their chance
Bob Ross,to Sparkle in the sun there I knew you could do this this is so nice makes you feel good when you paint there maybe right here theres another little Bush just comes right on down and we can work up
Bob Ross,in the other direction it dont make any difference which way you go there this big old tree let me grab a touch more of the Crimson there little more of the liquid white on my brush just to thin the
Bob Ross,paint just at end the paint when I went over that way the my my friend the bird sitting over there he thought I was going to feed him there we are see there just put these highlights in but dont kill
Bob Ross,all those beautiful dark areas if you kill all those darks itll be very flat dont want that to happen there this is one of the easiest ways that I have ever developed to put highlights on trees all
Bob Ross,you have to do is just sort of drop things in like it maybe down in here happy little Bush or two yep youre right you knew they were there okay there see Im just putting it on the top Im leaving
Bob Ross,the dark area down here nice and dark okay let me find another fan brush here I have several fan brushes going I want to begin taking this and pulling it smoothing it very lightly you can make this
Bob Ross,just as smooth as glass by working with it heres lets do a little lets do a little trick here lets take a little white at least little bit of phthalo blue I mean tiniest little bit theyo blue it
Bob Ross,goes a long way maybe right over in here coming out of this area maybe look at here look at here theres a little little path maybe this is where the little creatures have wandered around it comes
Bob Ross,right on around just by adding that little bit of blue though you can create the illusion of an indentation there a shadow that easy and we said we said we were going to have a little Lake here so
Bob Ross,lets take a little of our dark color some blue a little brown tap a little that in there and you have to make a big decision wheres your Lake going to live maybe right in here this is just a little
Bob Ross,Pond out here pull straight down straight down its most important if it if you go sidewards it wont look right pull straight down there we go may it goes right on over there just make a decision to
Bob Ross,drop it in then go across gives us instant Reflections and makes it look like very cold cold water that easy then we can take our fan brush in here and there here and there we can just put the
Bob Ross,indication of some little snow covered areas that are working their way down here there see maybe heres one over here wherever you want them see here comes one out into the water just a stone out
Bob Ross,there thats all covered with ice and snow boy its cold out here and we can clean up the bottom just using the fan brush and pull it across itll make it look like make it look even colder just
Bob Ross,barely grazing the canvas though makes those little little lines right across there and here and there here and there let me get another fan brush a little touch of brown you you can even put a little
Bob Ross,Stone thats sort of sticking out from underneath there just a little indication see however many you want and then come along clean it up bring a little color right over the top of it there okay look
Bob Ross,at that theres our little pad where the creatures come they walk down this path and come over here and get them a little drink of water there we go all right tell you what Lets do lets go back to
Bob Ross,our liner brush a little bit of vany brown maybe maybe maybe I didnt realize how much I say that maybe stuff until one day I was doing a demonstration for a PBS station somewhere and a little boy
Bob Ross,about 10 years old walked W behind me and as he walked behind me he says maybe maybe maybe made me realize how often I say that okay all Im doing there is just using a little brown putting a touch of
Bob Ross,color then Im going to add just a least little bit of light on one side and while we got that light going shoot lets put a little light on this tree down here baby theres a little sunlight zinging
Bob Ross,right through here there just strikes right on the edge there Sparkle that tree up back to my brown maybe theres a little touch of wire hanging around there I cant see let your imagination go there
Bob Ross,we are and here and there you can put a happy little stick some little Twigs theres always all kinds of little sticks and stuff that live in here and they they show different planes in your painting
Bob Ross,they help create that that illusion of depth its so important so so important there we go few over here dont want this side left down just to sort of bring it all together there we are maybe theres
Bob Ross,one hanging right over that way this is what makes it fun these little finishing touches that you can just take your time and drop in you can just do all kinds of things like it there you know one of
Bob Ross,the questions Im ask repeatedly when people write in they say they bought a pallette like this and it it doesnt look like mine well I take sandpaper and sand this pette so it doesnt shine same as
Bob Ross,with the brushes and stuff I take and put tape over them or we dull them somehow but theyre the same exact product that youre getting we put that on only so you dont get great big light glares in
Bob Ross,the TV people would yell at me sometimes they scream and yell at me if I if I dont do that so Im just going to add a little dark here and there around the bottom just wherever I think were about on
Bob Ross,the verge of having to finish painting what do you think my friend this is my little bird over here hes sitting here let me pick him back up come here come here there there he is isnt this a

Bob Ross,crisscross strokes and just dance in a happy little Sky its all there is to it just have fun just sort of let it happen there now then this is continually mixing with a liquid White and the color
Bob Ross,gets lighter and lighter as we work down the canvas to H for a little variation Im going to go right into some phthalo blue same old dirty brush and Im going to reach right over here and get the
Bob Ross,least little Touch of phthalo Green so we have phthalo blue and phthalo green we just its such a fantastic day lets just make a bright shiny little painting thatll itll just make you happy there
Bob Ross,we go just use some of these beautiful little colors thatll touch more color there and lets have some water in this painting you know me Im such a water freak I put water in just about every
Bob Ross,painting that I do there lets go down and Ill get a little more of the blue little more of the blue and a little more of the green and all Im doing is just tapping the brush into the color pull out
Bob Ross,the tiniest little amount of color and then tap the brush there its all you have to do now maybe the water will live right along in here somewhere so lets just go right across like so and well
Bob Ross,decide where the water is really at later right now all were doing is putting a little color on the canvas okay lets wash our brush and we wash our brushes with odorless thinner scrub them off good
Bob Ross,get all the paint out give them a shake and cover everybody now with a clean dry brush all Im going to do here still using the little crisscross Strokes is sort of blend my sky out you can make this
Bob Ross,sky as soft as you want it or you can leave it with some action in it so it didnt look dead very lightly go across take out the brush Strokes okay now then let lets have some fun today lets take
Bob Ross,well use the old fan brush well go right into titanium white with a fan brush load a lot of paint into the brush lot of paint well reach down here be right back right back there we go get the least
Bob Ross,little touch of bright red in it least little touch okay lets go up here maybe up here in the sky There lives just a happy little cloud and he just sort of floats around up here and has fun all day
Bob Ross,there just sort of let it play wherever you want it and clouds are free clouds are very free one of the freest things in nature there we go okay just maybe right along in there and Ill take a clean
Bob Ross,dry brush and very gently very gently Im just going to blend the base of it out not touching the top yet knock off the say paint off the brush then Im going to grab it and lift it upward in a big
Bob Ross,circular stroke and then very lightly very lightly just blend it a little bit ist that a super way of making a happy little Cloud good we dont want this Cloud to get lonely so lets go right in here
Bob Ross,and well put a another little Cloud right here and you can put as many or as few clouds in your world as you want just drop them in there we go maybe one lives right in there I dont know just make a
Bob Ross,decision drop it in knock off the excess paint again there I beat this big brush it just removes the paint that way you dont have to go through the entire cleaning procedure blend the base sort of
Bob Ross,lift it up tease it a little bit and then very lightly very lightly just go over aint that easy you got a scy full of beautiful little clouds Well Wash this brush there okay lets build us a lets
Bob Ross,build us a little mountain today and I think for that Im going to take a little bit of black vanand Dy Brown and a little touch of Prussian Blue there we go just sort of mix it like so pull it out as
Bob Ross,flat as you can get it Go in straight with a knife and cut across and get that little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife okay now then you got to make your first major decision where did
Bob Ross,your Mountain live maybe he lives right there push this paint right into the fabric get tough with it Zoom got to make all those little noises or it doesnt work right there we go see sort of let that
Bob Ross,pull right out through there like so and back to our large brush and I want to grab that and pull it since this is wet you can move the color you can move paint right on the canvas there just sort of
Bob Ross,let it disappear right down here into the Mist okay now then lets take some titanium white and dark Sienna got to mix that together but leave it marble like it dont over mix it and were going to
Bob Ross,take and cut off once again that little roll of paint and and go right up here no pressure no pressure just touch and let it flow right down the side of the mountain but no pressure just pretend your
Bob Ross,whisper floating across the mountain there there we go all right maybe see just let the knife bounce and play think about where there little Peaks and ridges and where the sunlight would bounce
Bob Ross,through there and Sparkle it all up wherever you want it okay now then lets take a little white some prussing blue Prussian Blue and some vanc brown maybe a touch more of the white there very nice
Bob Ross,very nice thatll be our shadow color once again we cut off that little tiny roll of paint there it is and lets go right up in here and just touch zoom and just follow the angles right down the
Bob Ross,mountain just like that there I want to keep that side quite dark I want this to really stand out okay now then take a clean dry brush and I have several of each brush going here so I dont have to
Bob Ross,spend all my time cleaning brushes and here Im just going to tap Just Tab following the angles in the mountain if you come straight across like that its going to cut it off like somebody took a big
Bob Ross,knife and just cut the bottom of it off we dont want that now very lightly two hairs and some air lift that upward upward so it just looks like its sitting right out there the Mist now then take a
Bob Ross,fan brush this time Ive dipped the fan brush into a small amount of the liquid white liquid white first and then into titanium white only to thin the pain a little now then lets go up here I thought
Bob Ross,today wed have some happy little clouds that have floated down here right down into the mountain here right in front of him just floated down maybe they got tired and just had to rest a while sit
Bob Ross,down here on this mountain take life easy there see its all there is to it just letting float right on down there and you put them wherever you want them as many as you want clean dry brush very
Bob Ross,gently very gently now then well just stir these up a little bit very lightly see the paint we Ed down here though is very firm very dry and you can paint right over the top of it without it turning
Bob Ross,to Mud be sure you have a very dry paint a lot of times I have people write and tell me that they went to the art store to buy paint and they said oh it doesnt matter what kind of paint you use you
Bob Ross,can do that be sure the paint is very very dry if not youre going to be angry with me I want this to work for you going back to the same old mountain color here cut off a little roll and maybe
Bob Ross,theres another Mountain that lives here since were doing a good tall vertical painting today we can have several ranges of mountain see just once again Block in your basic little shape this is good
Bob Ross,because itll give you practice with a couple layers of mountains there take our Big Brush grab it and pull it there we go but you can make a layer after layer after layer its a super super way to
Bob Ross,make friends with a knife okay go back to our highlight color dark sand and white touch and flow right down the side of the mountain just touch it and Float its all theres to it touch it let it go
Bob Ross,there okay tell you what Im going to get the little knife that little rasco works so nice sometimes in these smaller areas get my shadow color and lets go there see that little knife just sneaks
Bob Ross,right in there well just put a little bit of Shadow right along there wherever maybe have that highlight sort of wiggle and jiggle and there we go just let your imagination be your guide there youre
Bob Ross,only restricted by your imagination there we go just tap once again you want this Mist area at the base thats the only thing you have to separate its that little soft Misty area all Im doing is
Bob Ross,banging the brush a little bit to knock off the excess color now very lightly just whisper light whisper light isnt that fantastic that you can create two rows of mountains two ranges of mountains
Bob Ross,that easy but you can you can you can do anything all right lets lets have some fun maybe well make some little Foothills back here well take some little touch of the phthalo green a little blue
Bob Ross,little little bit of brown me get some more white in there green the blue the brown need enough to get a brush dirty here there got so much let me clean my knife off here and tell you what lets take
Bob Ross,lets take a 1 in Brush Im going to go right into some of that color with a 1in brush just load both sides with a little bit of color lets go right up here now maybe we just take the corner of the
Bob Ross,brush and maybe theres a happy little Foothill it lives right along there see there he is there he is you know he was there didnt you straight down straight down now with our Big Brush I want to
Bob Ross,create Mist so take tap that firmly firmly see there that easy that creates the illusion of mist okay well just take the same old brush maybe we need another Foothill I want to add a little bit of a
Bob Ross,lizard Crimson to that a little more of the Prussian Blue Im going to darken it each layer of Foothills as they get closer to you you get darker in value darker in color there we go see there by this
Bob Ross,being a little darker now itll stand out it becomes an individual its different there we go and you can just make layer after layer after layer in your world wherever you want them and as many as
Bob Ross,you want there now once again I want to create that illusion of mist at the base so take Big Brush and really get tough with it on the bottom down here dont get tough up here but down here just beat
Bob Ross,the devil out of it thats just where you take out all your frustrations and hostilities there its also where you need a good strong easel if you dont have a good strong easel its probably just
Bob Ross,going to just fall over on you you dont want that to happen this particular easel I made myself out of a platform ladder it makes a super super easel good and strong and you can use it to do a lot of
Bob Ross,other things my friend Dana had to had to plaster on his house the other day so he just took the easle head off and used his ladder to do some Plastering so you can too have multiple uses Im mixing
Bob Ross,up just some blue brown black all the dark colors a little bit of sap Green in there too we need a very dark color very dark color there we go and youre going to need a pretty good pile of it there
Bob Ross,okay let me find theres a nice looking fan brush lets go right into this load the fan brush full of color both sides and right up here now maybe theres some little trees that live way back here in
Bob Ross,the distance notice this color is darker this color is darker so it stands out if it wasnt darker it wouldnt look right you ever looked at a painting and maybe you didnt know exactly what was wrong
Bob Ross,with it but your mind told you somethings not right A lot of times is something as simple as the fact that the color does not get progressively darker as it works forward there just lift up like so
Bob Ross,well weve made one heck of a mess here hav we we dont make mistakes though we have happy accidents very soon very soon you learn to work with anything that happens I want a big tree there this son
Bob Ross,of a gun boy this sun shined on him and he got a lot of water life is good to him so he really got big strong big old tree now then lets take create us a reflection because this is wet you can make
Bob Ross,this paint slide and move see that easy just grab it and pull it and lightly go across in instant Reflections now lets take well use some yellow some yellow little bit of green into it and just mix
Bob Ross,these colors on your brush lets go up in here and lets put the indication of some nice shiny little grassy things that are far away Im just pushing upward with a brush there its all there is to it
Bob Ross,just make a little Peninsula that there he is lives right out there there we got him well take a little touch of the the brown and white white this dark Sienna and white put the indication of a
Bob Ross,little tree trunk in there little more of the dark green and we can put just a few little highlights on this big Evergreen here we dont want any highlights back here theyre too far away we want him
Bob Ross,to have a few right there though little liquid white on the knife get us a little of that and lets put us a water line right up in here just like so really cut that in act like youre trying to cut a
Bob Ross,hole right through the canvases very strong hard a few little ripples here and there now then we have to start making some big decisions so lets have some fun lets go up here we get some black and
Bob Ross,some pruss and blue what the heck just black and pruss and blue and lets make it decision maybe in this particular painting right here want some dark color just really get in there wipe it on just
Bob Ross,maybe right along in there doesnt matter how you put this on you can put it on with a paint roller start a whole new fad but just drop it in we need some dark in order to show some light that were
Bob Ross,going to put on there lets make lets make a couple of big trees back to our family handbrush since its already dirty maybe there lives in our world a big Evergreen right there there he goes there
Bob Ross,he goes big strong evergreen tree and that indicates by size that hes closer to you he lives right here in the foreground there there we go just wherever you want him to live maybe yeah lets say he
Bob Ross,has a friend right there there okay just sort of work back and forth thats all there is to it little Evergreens live right there in your fan bra sometimes you have to sort of push them out though
Bob Ross,okay shoot that brush is too slow Lets Get Serious here take the 2-in brush pull it through the paint in One Direction One Direction load a lot of color into the bristles and maybe right here lives
Bob Ross,just a happy little Bush and all were doing is putting in the background color for the bush well come back and well put all the beautiful little highlights on right now were just putting in some
Bob Ross,nice background color just push that brush bend it just bend it something like so now then let me find a fan brush Im going to dip it into the liquid white and then into titanium white so we have
Bob Ross,liquid white titanium white the liquid white is only to make it thinner okay lets go up here maybe the waters coming right along here its just having a good time and oh my gosh somebody has pulled
Bob Ross,the cork out and there it goes see just let it fall and it splashes down through here and it just wanders on around wherever you want it to go see there push upward to make those little foamy things
Bob Ross,just let it wander right on down okay let me get lets me get a 1 in Brush going to dip it into the liquid white once again to the end the paint then into some sap green and yellow a lot of paint in
Bob Ross,the bristles and lets begin putting some beautiful little highlights on some of these bushes and trees here there think about individual bushes dont just throw this on at random little yellow ochre
Bob Ross,little Indian yellow here and there maybe just a touch of the bright red now we need something for this to stand on lets take bandik Brown and well go right there and well make a Little Rock Just a
Bob Ross,Little Rock for it to stand on at here maybe yep comes right over in here wherever you want it take a touch of that mountain color and well add a little highlight there look at that okay now then
Bob Ross,going just pull that down on the side there little bit of our water splashing up against the edges back to our 1in brush and get some more sap green some yellow here now lets put a lets put a happy
Bob Ross,little Bush here in there maybe some grow right down here see let them grow right down like that lets go on the other side over here there there lives a nice Bush see think about individuals though I
Bob Ross,cant say that enough cant say that enough a little touch of the bright red there just Sparkles it up makes it really shine maybe right here there tell you what lets do we need something for this
Bob Ross,side to stand on too back to my van Brown and lets come right along in here and well put a happy little stone that lives here see just pull down like that look at there okay A little bit of the
Bob Ross,highlight color just pull it across angles are very important when youre doing this angles angles always look at you angles here pull a little touch of it down want this to stay dark underneath
Bob Ross,though there we go now back to our fan brush we can Splash a little bit of water up on there that cleans up the bottom of that brings it all together makes it really look nice tell you what I going to
Bob Ross,go into a little bit of titanium white the least Touch of phthalo blue lets get crazy today just a little bit of the phthalo blue maybe theres a little blue Bush it lives right there once in a while
Bob Ross,something like that really Sparkles your painting up okay then we can come right on back down in here see there pushes everything right back into the distance now take a touch of brown and white
Bob Ross,little indication here and there of a of a tree trunk little bit of highlight dont want too much like so scratch in a few little sticks and twigs now then lets have some fun lets bring the camera
Bob Ross,right up here Im going to take the contact paper off now lets pull that right down and look at that isnt that fantastic now then watch here the Old Clock on the wall tell me its about time to get
Bob Ross,out of here but I want to show you how you can bring this right out of this painting look at here see there let this Evergreen just protrude right out I love these shapes made with the contact paper
Bob Ross,and some of the Fantastic effects you can get with it look at there few highlights on it just like so what do you think I think we have finished painting and I really hope youve enjoyed this give it
Bob Ross,a try you can make all kinds of different shapes once again youre only limited by your imagination and from all of us here happy painting and God bless Music n Music
Bob Ross,hi welcome back glad you could join me again today tell you what lets have and run all the colors across the screen and then well go on up here and do a fantastic little painting and Ive got my
Bob Ross,standard old 18x 24in canvas up here its covered with liquid white its all slick and ready to go so lets go today I thought wed do a little scene maybe that has some great big mountains and I get
Bob Ross,a lot of letters saying Im still having problems doing mountains so lets lets work on some mountains today and Ill take you step by step through that procedure and I think itll make mountain
Bob Ross,painting a little easier lets start out today with a small amount of phthalo blue very very small amount and going to reach right over here and pick up some of the midnight black so we got phthalo
Bob Ross,blue and midnight black black and blue blue and black black and blue thats the way I look when I talk back to my wife there we go all right lets go right up here using little crisscross Strokes
Bob Ross,lets just lay in a quick little Sky just just let the brush just sort of dance and play and have fun like so okay get a little touch more of the color and all were doing is making little xes and
Bob Ross,leave some holes open here and there in your Sky when we blend that out thatll come out it almost looks like clouds up here and youve done almost nothing there now the more overcast you want your
Bob Ross,Sky to be the more black you add to it thatll bring it down and gray it and itll make it look very overcast oo big old mean looking sky here we are okay while we have that brush dirty take some of
Bob Ross,the same color just blue and black just tap a little into the bristles blue and black and lets just go right down here well have a little water maybe coming right there right there pull from the
Bob Ross,outside in that way you have these nice feathered edges here that are very very easy to blend if you you start here and go over its very difficult to blend out those edges this is a a lazy persons
Bob Ross,way of painting we want it to be as easy as possible for you now then let me wash my brush give it a good scrub shake off excess now Im going to warn you if you do that in your living room the same
Bob Ross,way I do here youre going to redecorate the whole room in one heart beat suggest you get your brush beater rack its a little rack that goes down in the bottom of waist paper basket you shake the
Bob Ross,brush inside of the basket and bead it on the rack and it it saves your happy home thats no joke now then with just a clean dry brush Im going to begin blending the sky now you can blend it until
Bob Ross,its very smooth and very subdued I want it to to keep some of these light spots in it I dont want to kill all of them but in your painting you blend it to whatever degree of lightness or darkness
Bob Ross,that you want painting is very individual theres as many different ways to paint as there are painters so the big thing is as you do what makes you happy and if it works then its right there we go
Bob Ross,see that little light spot Still Remains in there even though weve gently going across it all right lets have some fun today were going to do some mountains so lets do some very simple little
Bob Ross,mountains well take some cressan blue and midnight black and to that Im going to add a little bit of white so we got blue black and white impression blue midnight black titanium white pull it out
Bob Ross,very flat get tough with it go straight down and cut across so we have that little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife now you have to make your first major decision lets go right up in here
Bob Ross,use a lot of pressure push push very firmly and then just begin creating some basic shapes for your Mountain there and when you make your mountains you make mountains that you like you make the shapes
Bob Ross,that you want the only thing that I would recommend is be careful not to make them just all look like little ice cream cones somebody in class one time told me it looked like Wigwam Village so that
Bob Ross,can happen without you even realizing it when you first start so all youre worried about right now is the basic shape of your Mountain you could really care less whats happening anywhere where else
Bob Ross,take the large brush pull that downward there had a little hair that dropped out just take a corny brush and lift them off okay now then I want this mountain Im going to put a couple of mountains I
Bob Ross,think in this painting want this first one here we want it to be far away so I want you take titanium white I dont want this one to be very bright and Im going to take a little touch of the mountain
Bob Ross,color and put into it I want to all that white down there okay pull it out flat once again really get tough hard as you can do it now this knife has a straight edge on it so you go straight down just
Bob Ross,touch and pull all there is to it get that little roll of paint I want very very little color back in here just the least little indication and even that Im going to blend it and diffuse it until
Bob Ross,most of it goes away see there this is too far away dont want a lot of detail in it if it has a lot of detail itll runn that illusion of distance and painting is nothing more than games of Illusion
Bob Ross,there is like the magician just like the magician Im going to take a little bit of the mountain color and just very gently I want a dark edge here just a little dark here in there Im not even going
Bob Ross,to really put any big shadow colors in there just a little dark here and there see and that helps create that illusion once again there who was it I think Houdini once said theres no trick to taking
Bob Ross,the rabbit out of the Hat the trick is getting him in there in the first place so same thing here were just working with Illusions there we go see that gives you the impression of a lot of things
Bob Ross,happening and youve done very very little now with a good clean dry brush and be sure its dry very gently just tap all were doing is just tapping and follow the angles that you put in there lift
Bob Ross,slightly upward very very lightly see there just let it blend right into nothing that Mountains way back here its just sort of floating there okay its a very very nice soft Moun that youve done
Bob Ross,okay and then lets put another one thats closer to us bigger stronger for that clean my knife here I well take black and press in blue well just use black and blue today what the heck pull it out
Bob Ross,flat once again cut off our little roll of paint now have to make another big decision where does your big mountain live maybe it lives way up here and you just make a decision and firmly firmly push
Bob Ross,this paint right into the fabric look at there get tough with it now see this color this base color is darker than the base color you use back on that mountain back here so that helps create the
Bob Ross,illusion that its in the front and we dont know where it goes over here scrape off all the excess paint scrape firmly I think you could probably hear that really get in there and just scrape it
Bob Ross,scrape it you cant get all that color off the canvas if you want to its in the fabric now but you can move it because the canvas is wet you can pull it and it helps create that illusion of mist down
Bob Ross,at the base that easy all righty there we go there we go just pull it see there all right we can wash your brush thats a fun part of this shake it off there we go okay lets put some highlights on
Bob Ross,this one for this one for this one Im going to use just straight titanium white so you can really see it pull it out flat once again cut off that little roll of paint its right down the edge of the
Bob Ross,knife down then no pressure let it float make that little noise let it float just flow right down the side of the mountain but no pressure If you apply pressure its going to look just like youre
Bob Ross,icing a cake and I dont think youre going to be happy with it there want that paint to break so it has all these little things in there automatically and you just make big decisions where you think
Bob Ross,things are to live drop them in that easy you have unlimited power on this piece of canas just its phenomenal what you can do absolutely phenomenal but the first step is to believe that you can do it
Bob Ross,this just they little blue and white little roll of paint once again there we come right along here touch it let it flow maybe well take this one and come right directly through push that first one
Bob Ross,right back into the background now we can get this big one bring it directly through see how it creates the illusion of different planes in that mountain over here theres one create a little Valley
Bob Ross,in there little place for the mountain goat to go and hide hes got to have a a little secret place hes just like us everybody needs a a little secret place to hide there maybe this one look at there
Bob Ross,comes right over like that we dont know here and there maybe theres a little Ridge but you see the angles are very important mountains are just geometric shapes theyre just theyre angles just play
Bob Ross,with them have fun see here we can bring it right on up like that maybe bring these right together theres no end to this you could do anything there there we go just see it in your mind and then put
Bob Ross,it right here on the canvas watch here watch here see this ones way back come there you can see it see it way back look at the power you have watch here watch here grab it and were going to pull it
Bob Ross,right into the foreground do you know you could move mountains that easy you can do anything there now we need a shadow right there that has to have a shadow or he wont play with us little shadow in
Bob Ross,there and wherever you want them see there very gentle touch though okay bye golly weve got a mess of mountains going here now I want to create the illusion of mist down here so once again take a
Bob Ross,good clean dry brush 2in brush and begin tapping and lifting very lightly very very lightly tap its just this just diffuses we dont want to destroy we want to diffuse there we go all right just
Bob Ross,laying in the Mist down there and over here well go in this direction boy weve done some fantastic mountains and if you if youve painted these with me if youve been painting Along by now you
Bob Ross,should be really really having control over the mountains I I get a lot of letters from people saying theyre having some problems lets take some black and some blue and get some van brown little
Bob Ross,little lizard and Crimson too what the heck what the heck Im going to take a little white be right back there pull a little bit of that color out put a little white with it so its a little bit
Bob Ross,lighter okay let me clean my knife and grab a 1 in Brush here and go right into that just take take the 1in brush and go into it lets make some little Foothills back here we spent so much time
Bob Ross,working on mountains lets just real quickly here throw in something else so we have a nice finished painting but when youre practicing at home just make layer after layer after layer of mountains
Bob Ross,the important thing is not ending with a finished painting its learning how to do mountains or whatever it is that you want to learn and when youre painting home look at look at each painting each
Bob Ross,painting is a learning experience look at it itll have super good things in it maybe itll have some things in it theyre a little weak those things that are a little weak spend some time practicing
Bob Ross,those and dont get upset with them dont get upset with them something I used to tell my students all the time which I sincerely believe with all my heart if you ever in your whole painting career do
Bob Ross,a painting that youre totally satisfied with you might as well stop your painting career is you have nowhere else to go the fact that youre dissatisfied with your painting when its done and you can
Bob Ross,see room for improvement is a blessing cherish it cherish it I love people who are plagued with dissatisfaction its the most fantastic thing you can own if youre satisfied with everything you do
Bob Ross,then you dont try anymore I hope youre always plagued with dissatisfaction in your painting there cuz if you if you are youre lucky I have yet to do a painting that Im satisfied with but one day
Bob Ross,Im going to the next painting may be it Ive Ive used the same color here only darker I want to put some little footy heels that are closer to me same exact color all be darker this did not have the
Bob Ross,titanium white in use the same old dirty brush Im going to tap the base of it to create that nice little Misty effect just tap it okay and then while I have that color Im going to have water here so
Bob Ross,Im going to just tap a little bit right in there and well pull that down and make some Reflections that easy there we are see grab it decide where your reflection is going to live pull straight down
Bob Ross,its important that you pull straight down there look at that now very lightly very lightly go straight across and we have some instant Reflections now take some liquid white Im going reach up here
Bob Ross,and get a least little touch of the phthalo blue I mean just the least little touch just want to Tin it a little bit cut across lets go up here and lets put us in a happy little water line back here
Bob Ross,there we go just a nice light area to separate these darks there maybe there a ripple or two going across the water whatever whatever these ripples should be straight off so though okay let me grab a
Bob Ross,big brush shoot lets get crazy here go right into the dark color dark color its the same color all right lets go right over in here now maybe over in here yep lets have a few trees and stuff over
Bob Ross,on this side maybe they come down right in there wherever you want all were doing is putting in a dark base color maybe maybe maybe yep right there well just have one big tree I dont want to lose
Bob Ross,all these mountains those are pretty nice mountains want you to be able to see them underneath here well put in some dark thatll be our Reflections see just throw it in we dont make mistakes we
Bob Ross,have happy accidents now then take our brush pull straight down see see there that turns into our Reflections go across and instant Reflections instant Reflections all right lets go on this side over
Bob Ross,here lets just put in all kinds of pretty little things there well Im about to cover up that mountain too thats all right long as you learn how to make a mountain we know hes back there we know
Bob Ross,hes there maybe this old tree comes right up into here Im going to get a touch of the dark sien on my brush too just add a little dark Sienna right there and let this Lim hang right out over the
Bob Ross,mountain here I almost try to save that Peak and when you do your painting look at the things that you want to save and work around them there see that sort of just comes all the way around that I
Bob Ross,like that and I like big trees in the foregrounds of the painting it helps produce that illusion of dep depth and distance and just makes the paintings deeper there we go I tell you what same old
Bob Ross,brush Im going to go into least little touch of yellow little yellow CAD yellow little yellow ochre because I have that color on there its going to turn a very dark green lets go back up here I
Bob Ross,want to begin putting the indication of a few little highlights here and there were now painting the limbs that are behind the trunk in a minute Ill paint a trunk in this tree and then well put
Bob Ross,some bright highlights that are on this side but sort of think like a tree I know it sounds crazy but you have limbs that are behind the trunk some that are in front some that are hanging to the side
Bob Ross,sort of paint that way there see just just little indications were just looking for some form and a little bit of shape right now were not really too worried about anything other than that maybe
Bob Ross,well do the same thing over here on this one just a few little things here and there is it fantastic you could take a brush this big and paint all those little things dont be afraid of these brushes
Bob Ross,cuz theyre big okay tell you what lets get crazy Ill take the small knife Im going to get a big bunch of Van Dyk Brown got quite a large roll of paint on there decide where your where your tree
Bob Ross,trunks going to live this is your Brave retest for today got to make that noise so it dont work there put in that big tree that fun just drop him in and when you paint for your friends or family
Bob Ross,where they say you do something like this they just know youve destroyed a beautiful painting theyll get all excited and carry on enjoy it Im going to take going and take my dark color black and
Bob Ross,some blue put a little sap Green in there too little brown little Crimson whatever whatever whatever long as it start clean my knife okay lets go right in there with a fan brush shoot maybe maybe
Bob Ross,right over here lives a happy little evergreen tree just fill up that little hole there there we go give him a little friend see there lets go on the other side maybe theres one that lives right
Bob Ross,here right in front of the mountain Bo hes got some kind of view doesnt he there I I really wasnt planning on doing this all this in the painting I just wanted to show you really how to do
Bob Ross,fantastic Mountain but this turned into a pretty nice little painting too take a little dark Sienna a little white pull it out very flat grab it lets go up here now it just let this touch graze
Bob Ross,barely touching come right down the tree we put some highlight on it Rascal on the other side put a little touch of blue there there we go darker darker darker as it works around the tree Im going to
Bob Ross,use the liner brush here a little thinner go right into the Brown lets have a little tree limb here and there there we go just here and there however many you want Im going to put some highlights on
Bob Ross,here so youre not going to see many of those maybe back here in this tree we need a little trunk you just put that on with a liner brush now lets take a 1in brush Im go right into my yellows right
Bob Ross,into the yellow tap a lot of paint onto the bristles want this to be quite bright want this to stand out this is going to be our leaves and stuff thats in the front lot of lights hitting here like so
Bob Ross,there now if you have trouble making the paint stick add a little little paint thinner or a little touch of the liquid white just to thin it down and think about patterns and shapes in here dont just
Bob Ross,hit it random there little individual thing is going on in here there we are and theres some in front of the trunk just all kinds of little doers there we go maybe back in here this is little bushes
Bob Ross,that are nice and dark there see them see them there they are this old tree sitting down in a bunch of big bushes that easy tell you what Lets do lets take some van Dy Brown and go maybe a little
Bob Ross,bit of brown and white maybe theres some little land masses in here there and back to our 1in brush and we can put all kinds of little grassy things that grow all around there but all Im doing is
Bob Ross,using the corner of the brush and just tapping down very very easy very simple and you can make some of the most Striking Effects little yellow ochre Indian yellow there but thats a nice one there
Bob Ross,but work in layers think about the lay of the land were going to leave some of that nice dirt showing in there lets go up the other side brighten up that little tree look at there look at him shine
Bob Ross,in the sun there isnt that one of the nicest little ways though making all kinds of little leaves and bushes lets have some dirt on this side too there there we go see and you just drop in wherever
Bob Ross,little touch of highlight its just brown and white again there and a few little bushes and stuff there we go maybe one big bush here and with that the Old Clock on the wall tells me its about time
Bob Ross,to go for today I hope youve enjoyed this its a good steady in mountains and itll teach you how to do some of the most fantastic mountains that youve ever seen little water line under there I
Bob Ross,think we have a finished painting from all of us here happy painting and God Music bless Music
Bob Ross,hi its a fantastic day and im glad youre here with me so i tell you what today lets paint the little animated opening thats the one you see at the beginning of each show in this series a little
Bob Ross,seascape and ill show you exactly how that one was done lets start out and have around all the colors across the screen that were used to paint that picture while theyre doing that let me show you
Bob Ross,what ive done up here i have my standard old pre-stretch canvas but today ive covered it with a thin even coat of well i guess youd call this liquid gray ive taken liquid white and liquid black in
Bob Ross,about equal proportions and cover the entire canvas ive also decided basically where the horizon line will be because i want it to be straight in the seascape and ill just put a piece of masking
Bob Ross,tape across here which well pull off later so tell you what lets get started and lets do a little seascape im going to start today with a small amount of prussian blue on the two inch brush
Bob Ross,prussian blue this is an overcast looking sky in this particular painting so well add a little black to it just mix it on the brush these capes traditionally are are sort of hard to paint but i try
Bob Ross,to show you an easy way of making very effective little seascapes now lets start right up in here just using little crisscross strokes just begin putting in a little sky there we go like so very very
Bob Ross,easy just little xs and the area where the big clouds are going to be well just sort of leave that open okay a little more depression blue and black and lets go to the other side over here there so
Bob Ross,theres to it okay it didnt take just a second when using a two inch brush to drop in a happy little sky or today maybe a mean little sky now then without cleaning the brush im going to get the
Bob Ross,least little touch of alizarin crimson on the bristles just a small amount just a small amount and because theres blue on there thatll turn sort of a lavender color a little lavender right down here
Bob Ross,like so okay fantastic a little bit over on this side maybe a little touch more now when youre doing your seascape you put whatever color you want in there and in what degree you may want it brighter
Bob Ross,or duller or whatever whatever whatever makes you happy thats what we are to do okay weve got the start of a nice little sky now then today lets use the one inch brush and put some clouds in you
Bob Ross,could put them in with a two inch brush with a fan brush ill just use a one inch brush today it doesnt matter whatever makes you happy go through titanium white pull the brush just like so to load
Bob Ross,it im gonna be right back im gonna get the least little touch of cad yellow leaves a little touch a lot of paint in the bristles bristles are fully loaded okay now then lets go right up in here and
Bob Ross,just using little circular strokes just begin laying in some basic shapes basic little shapes maybe around like so now this will not be an exact duplicate of the one that you see at the opening of the
Bob Ross,show i dont think you could ever in a hundred years paint an exact duplicate itll show you how it was made and you can make your own at home there we are okay up in here once again little circular
Bob Ross,strokes and try not to stay in the in the same area and keep working it or youll just end up with great big old cotton balls in the sky and we really want we really want to have nice actions up here
Bob Ross,okay there all right well this is a monster cloud big cloud theres going to be a big storm coming here if you got a little boat you better put it away lets go get washed right on out maybe over here
Bob Ross,see okay let me grab a big brush be sure its dry now using just the corn of the brush im just sort of stirring it up mix it up like that very gentle every once in a while you can beat the brush just
Bob Ross,to knock the excess paint out youre going to pick up a little paint here there we go just knock it out okay blend it blend it there now very lightly this is two hairs in some air grab it and lift it
Bob Ross,fluff it tease it pull it there make love to it here very gentle very gentle there we go and this paint that im using is very firm and very dry and you can do all this blending without it mixing now
Bob Ross,we just take out the brush strokes that easy that easy you gotta well you got a big cloud there a little more of the white on the brush and maybe over here lets have another cloud right up in there
Bob Ross,see just as many or as few clouds as you want in your world just drop them in always using that little circular stroke though and think about think about shape and form here dont just throw them in
Bob Ross,at random you might luck out but your chances are much better if you if you plan it a little bit when youre looking there we are all right boy thats a lot of clouds in one painting maybe that one
Bob Ross,comes way up here look at there but see how easy it was used to when i was traditional painter i used to labor over clouds thats one of the easiest things that there is to do there okay now then
Bob Ross,lets go right over there put in some more happy little clouds and work in layers in your mind think which clouds are farthest away and do that one first and work forward forward forward always
Bob Ross,working forward there maybe one right here whoever you have to make those big decisions thats what makes painting fun is that you can make decisions and you can create a world that you want there we
Bob Ross,are sometimes were not totally satisfied with the world the way it is in here if youre not satisfied with the world that you create then you have no one to blame but yourself there we go i think
Bob Ross,ive mentioned on previous shows i spent half my life in the military and i used to come home take off my little soldier hat put on my painters hat and there id build the kind of world that i wanted
Bob Ross,it was peaceful it was quiet there was no hassles nobody was yelling and it was good everything was good nobody was going to get shot or hurt not in my world and its a happy place but you build build
Bob Ross,the kind of world that you want there fluff it up lift it tease it pull it there just can blend those clouds to any degree of softness that you want but always in big circular strokes like that you
Bob Ross,dont want to come straight up itll look like its raining up and itll usually bother you knock off the excess paint and very lightly once again just blend the entire sky there we are see there we
Bob Ross,got a fantastic little sky super big clouds okay i can wash this whole brush off now odorless thinner and be sure its odorless youre not only running your whole family off but youll run yourself
Bob Ross,off okay now as i mentioned earlier i have a little masking tape right here lets pull that off and we have a very straight horizon line because we put that on there and ill take a little touch of
Bob Ross,the lets get a little touch a little touch of color here and well just work that in im just picking up a little bit of that what do we call it liquid gray there because its wet and just working it
Bob Ross,in there okay thats basically all you have to do just work in a little bit of color cover up where the tape was at okay and were in business again and then when im doing seascapes let me clean this
Bob Ross,one of the things that i like to do is sort of lay out a basic form for my major wave main reason being where the transparency that or the eye of the wave is i want that to be light i dont want this
Bob Ross,dark color on there so to do that lets take a little crimson i just use a liner brush here crimson little phthalo blue just mix it on the brush get a little thinner on it there just make sort of a
Bob Ross,little lavender color it doesnt matter now then come right down here decide where your major wave is going to be maybe that son of a gun is going to go way up here see its going to break the horizon
Bob Ross,here come down maybe go over i think thats the way we had it so im like so it doesnt matter it owned off and thats going to come right on out there now right here maybe thatll help right there
Bob Ross,will be the eye the eye the wave or the transparency now then we can take a lets take our fan brush well go right in here get a little phthalo blue little phthalo blue little prussian blue and lets
Bob Ross,just go right up in here in between here im going to add a little bit of this darker color right in here see all you got to do is just sort of fill it in fill it up keep this horizon line quite
Bob Ross,straight if it gets crooked itll bother you and im im using this fan brush only because i dont want to get in there with a big brush and lose those areas normally we just do this with a big brush
Bob Ross,there see there speaking of big brush lets get one here well get some blue on it and some black and a little touch of the phthalo green very dark and come right down in here right in here there we
Bob Ross,can begin putting in some color all were doing here is laying in color very dark so our light will show there thats just the blues and black and a little green okay we want that maybe about down
Bob Ross,safe there thats good and it cuts about where we had it okay all right ill just take the same old brush im gonna go right into van dyke brown just load some in the bristles it really doesnt matter
Bob Ross,how you load it just tap some in there now then the rest of the canvas im going to fill up with brown van dyke brown once again this is just a base color were going to cover all of this up it really
Bob Ross,its no big deal just our base color dont look like much of a seascape so far does it but you remember our golden rule we dont make mistakes we have happy accidents so we can turn this into a
Bob Ross,beautiful painting no matter what because between the two of us we can do anything there all right and we have our painting blocked in now we can go ahead let me take a little blue and little green
Bob Ross,this is phthalo blue little phthalo green and i know right here see its nice because weve already painted this painting i know basically whats going to happen we can take put in where our major
Bob Ross,wave is going to be here see there just add a little color thats all there is there pull it over just think about how the waves formed right here a little that here and there there all right now then
Bob Ross,lets take our lets take our little filbert brush take some titanium white the least least little touch of cad yellow least little touch very small amount lets go right back up here now this is
Bob Ross,going to be the ira wave our transparency take your filbert and just scrub it using the side of it scrub it firmly and begin working out youre going to start picking up the underneath color its
Bob Ross,going to get darker darker darker as you work out from that transparency and thats exactly what we want allow the canvas to work for you there we go okay lets have a little more right over here
Bob Ross,there dont want this one quite as bright as the other one but right in there well have a little and in here were going to have all kind of little foamy things that are happening and you can begin
Bob Ross,putting in some basic little shapes here just using this brush there all right now be sure this two inch brush were going to use is clean and dry use just the corner of it just the corner and just
Bob Ross,just gently gently wiggle it just wiggle it can you see that just barely see just barely turning little tiny circular strokes there you go now you can see it better see how thats just coming together
Bob Ross,not fantastic that you can do that with such a big old brush now we can begin pulling in the shape here that easy that easy and over here well blend this one out using just the corner of this brush
Bob Ross,and i prefer the two inch to the one inch brush for doing this it seems to have more bristles and it makes it smoother there we are okay now then let me find ive got several of each brush going here
Bob Ross,im going back into the crimson and a little bit of blue and im going to make a lavender color here just lizard crimson and little phthalo blue all right lets go back up here now then im going to
Bob Ross,start i want to add a little shadow right here this is im just using the side of the brush think about the foam thats crashing all in here this is the shadow part of the foam thats all were doing
Bob Ross,right now tiny little strokes so i hope you can see that and just let it go right on the rail see like so okay clean that comes the fun part now we want to make this wave crashing over so im going to
Bob Ross,use a fan brush just load some titanium white into it just both sides now think about how the wave is its coming up here and its hitting got to make those little sounds see wipe your brush off as it
Bob Ross,picks up the color okay heres another one and dont make it too even this this is water is its churning and its mad oh its just raising the devil okay back to my little filbert wipe the paint off
Bob Ross,well take titanium white and the least least little touch of the yellow in it once again okay lets go up here now we want to put some highlights on this so here we just sort of push upward push give
Bob Ross,it a little upward push and as you pick up that under color reload your brush put new color on it come back look at that look at that isnt it fun boy that water is just churning and raising the devil
Bob Ross,there comes all up through there maybe it just sort of goes right off into the distance like that okay now im gonna wipe off all the paint and im gonna come back and very lightly just a clean dry
Bob Ross,brush begin blending that together keep your brush as clean and dry as possible so it just blends together there now let me find my big brush again back to the old two inch brush once again very
Bob Ross,lightly all youre doing is just mixing it up just stirring it up see there and you can make it as smooth as silk just turned up okay im going to take im going to define this edge a little more make
Bob Ross,it a little bit brighter and make some little things happening in there push so youre when you push upward thats when your foam pattern comes off there all right okay now then we need some waves
Bob Ross,happening here lets take the small knife i like the small knife for this because its a little bit thinner a little bit flimsier it bends easier and i need this to bend a little roll of paint were
Bob Ross,going to start right up in here watch here very firm pressure look at here very firm pressure as you run out of paint add a little more paint look at that isnt that fantastic and and and then it
Bob Ross,comes right on out through here see there but that easy but need a very firm pressure and a good dry paint or you run into problems now you can begin thinking about form and shape here this little
Bob Ross,knife is fantastic for doing entire seascapes its unreal what you can do with it its just absolutely unreal okay tell you what that was so much fun lets do another one lets do another one maybe
Bob Ross,start right about here in the same almost the same spot and well let it come out and look at there a lot of pressure bend that knife bend it you want that ridge of paint there there we got the water
Bob Ross,coming right up on the shore that easy maybe theres a little more water just wherever just and let that just sort of blend right on back im applying quite a bit of pressure dont be afraid of this
Bob Ross,get in there and do it okay tell you what ill take some paint thinner im gonna go right into the white titanium white with at least least little touch of the yellow on it i just want to sparkle this
Bob Ross,edge on this just sparkle it a little bit and we can bring it right on down there like so and back in here we want to begin putting individual little wave shapes all the way up to the horizon now all
Bob Ross,these little details in here are what really make the painting exciting and just sort of use a little motion like little waves and that easy you can create the illusion of all kind of little things
Bob Ross,happening in there lets go on the other side over here see there just throw in a few and right along in here put a few little things these little little foamy things here theyre really what make
Bob Ross,your painting spectacular and you can put them in with a liner brush put a few of them in here at home where you have unlimited time its unbelievable what you can do here if i go over 30 minutes they
Bob Ross,dont have any sense of humor they yell and scream at me director comes out here and says bad things shes mean there now maybe back in here just put some little indications of things happening back
Bob Ross,in it that gives it just little details there we go see the more you put in the more interesting it becomes and people will think you work for so long on these all right lets get lets get serious
Bob Ross,here clean off my palate a little bit lets go into the van dyke brown come and grab a big bunch of paint lets come right up in here i want to take this is your bravery test on this painting lets
Bob Ross,just come right out there well put a little bit of land out here there were some palm trees in that painting we need a place for them to sit there there all right all im doing is putting van dyke
Bob Ross,brown okay lets take some white some dark sienna its just plain white dark sienna maybe underneath here color is a little lighter and take your knife and just scrub it just rub it very hard and you
Bob Ross,can blend this right in make that beach just stand out there okay a little bit of black right here maybe theres a look at there see just a little something there to sparkle it now then lets begin
Bob Ross,working on some things in here well take some of the brown and the white lay a little highlight here and there just let that boop sort of run right over the edge here and there whatever there we go
Bob Ross,so you just let all kind of little things happen in here im gonna pick up some white and get a little touch of the bright red the yellows get crazy in here lets put in some beautiful colors there
Bob Ross,let these things just happen wherever you want them little sap green little yellow here and there oh thats nice i like to paint with a palette knife it just makes so many beautiful things happen all
Bob Ross,right take my fan brush van dyke brown we have a palm tree that lives right there one right here and another one maybe he lives right there now with a paint as thin as water im going into straight
Bob Ross,midnight black and lets put in just the indication of some leaves here winds blowing boy look at him go look at him go see and you just put as many as you want and thats basically how the little
Bob Ross,animated opening at the beginning of the show was made it only takes a minute to do it but it takes a lot of people a long time to make it happen they work very hard okay a little clock on the wall

Bob Ross,Once Again get a touch of the cad yellow cadum yellow just a little bit just a little bit make a nice bright color here same 1in brush and Im going to go right around the outside of this just right
Bob Ross,on around this is just yellow and white like so there we go it looks like an egg I cooked this morning there certainly dont want to eat any of my cooking and maybe well have a little water down here
Bob Ross,and well put a little touch of that yellow and white mixture right down in here now then Im going to go right into a little touch of the yellow o I havent cleaned the brush still has the yellow and
Bob Ross,white right into a little yellow ochre and well blend a little touch of that right around the edges there we go this is just plain yellow ochre there we are I want to add a little touch of Indian
Bob Ross,yellow to that too oh yeah thats nice that brightens it up even better there we are now then well put a little bit of that down here and you can just put this on any way it makes you happy there
Bob Ross,just throw it in all were looking for is a little color well come back and straighten it all up and have fun with it later right now all were doing is just putting in some base colors all right now
Bob Ross,then going to take a touch of the bright red right into the yellow okay bright red and yellow ochre we go back up here and Im going to add that right around here like so there sort of an orangey
Bob Ross,color so I say this is just going to be a very bright happy little painting there and when youre putting these layers of color on here use little crisscross Strokes because that way you have
Bob Ross,feathered edges if you just make a circle around here its a son of a gun to blend it out and were going to try to blend all this color out so really really suggest that you use a little crisscross
Bob Ross,Strokes makes it so much easier now going take a little bit of brown little brown little brown reach over here get a little touch be right back there it is little touch of the blue and put it right in
Bob Ross,the brown so I have Prussian Blue and Van Dyk Brown same old dirty brush and Im going to start it up in here I want a darker color on the outside edges so start out here and let it work forward that
Bob Ross,way itll get lighter lighter lighter as it mixes with a liquid white Okay add a little touch more of that color to my brush and well put a little touch over here dont need too much on this side and
Bob Ross,and and we can even put a little bit down in here there already this is just a fun painting just just a fun paint a little bit on the other side all right we wash your brush wash him off real good
Bob Ross,give him a shake and just beat the devil out of now then get a very dry brush be sure your brush is dry if its wet and you hit all this youre going to end up in agony City and youre going to be
Bob Ross,upset with me be sure its good and dry there and just begin blending still making the little crisscross Strokes little crisscross Strokes blend blend blend now you can spend a lot of time on this
Bob Ross,blending if you want and you can make it oh its just its unbelievable how smooth you can make it you wont be able to tell where one color stops and the next color starts but always work in the
Bob Ross,light area out dont bring your dirty brush back into the center keep that dirty brush on the outside there now if you wanted to go back and do it again wash your brush wash your brush there we go
Bob Ross,give it a good shake and just beat it that really is the fun part of this there see and then well just blend this more now when youre doing this at home it pays some time to step back and take a
Bob Ross,look see its hard to see right up close exactly what you have but but if you stand back and look at it then youll see it there okay and very lightly very lightly just go over the entire thing to
Bob Ross,take out the brush Strokes okay now then I want to put a sun up in here so Ill just use my finger and lets go right up in here and just using the finger we can just put in a little circle see thats
Bob Ross,all there is to it now if you tried to blend that the way it is chances are it would probably smear theres a lot of paint so you can take your knife and come right back up here and lets look a
Bob Ross,minute so you take your knife and you just go like that the value remains in the canvas see there and you can do this couple of three times if you want to to get a desired lightness okay and then down
Bob Ross,here we can just bring all this together just like so there see this painting makes you feel warm there and thats good as I say were having a fantastic day here so I just felt like doing something
Bob Ross,that was nice and bright and and sharing it with you its just its just Good to Be Alive sometime there wash off her brush there we are now then if you want you could put some little clouds out here
Bob Ross,in this Sky shoot Ill just do a quickie here just show you how we take a little blue a little bit of crimson little touchy white little more Crimson in that ooh thats nice thats nice that was a
Bob Ross,little little phthalo blue little Crimson little bit of white now then get us a fan brush we just load a little color on it and maybe theres just a little floater just sort of floats around here in
Bob Ross,the sky and has fun all day maybe comes r on across we dont know wherever you want it see there and you put as many or as few as you want in your world just want to show you how to do it look at that
Bob Ross,see just some little floaters down in here okay then we take our Big Brush once again be sure its good and dry blend it a tiny tiny bit knock off the excess paint and very lightly very light look at
Bob Ross,that see there just blend in them happy little clouds I dont use blue in these clouds because theres yellow here in the sky you use blue in there youre going to have bright green clouds unless you
Bob Ross,want green clouds if you want green clouds then you should have green clouds all right tell you what today lets build a little mountain lets build a little mountain Im going to take some Prussian
Bob Ross,Blue and Del lierin Crimson proportionately much more Crimson than blue much more the blue is many many times stronger now if you want to see what color you got put a little white out there see thats
Bob Ross,very very blue okay Im going to Im going to add a little bit more Crimson to that there I want it more into the lavender the reddish lavender all right that looks better already okay clean off my
Bob Ross,knife lets build us a little mountain little paint on the knife just come right up in here and you have to make a decision where in your world does your Mountain live there he is there he is maybe
Bob Ross,theres a bump here see and just let him go just look around and see what kind of mountains are in your area and if you live in an area where theres no mountains you certainly certainly can leave the
Bob Ross,mountains out and you still have a beautiful painting I get letters from people sometime they say oh you do too many mountains the next letter open say you dont do enough mountains so I really try to
Bob Ross,please the majority of people but if you dont want a mountain in your world then leave it out the painting is still complete without a mountain there we are you know every every day I get letters
Bob Ross,from Fantastic people all over the country are doing some of the most beautiful paintings and I love to see them every once in a while we put them on a board and we show them on TV so if you have time
Bob Ross,take a take a photograph of the painting youre doing send it in let me let me take a look see at the kind of work that youre doing from watching the show there to see what youre doing that really
Bob Ross,makes a lot of hard work worthwhile its great it is fantastic there Im going to take titanium white and put the least little touch of the bright red in it least little touch just want to give it a
Bob Ross,touch of a pinkish glow pull it out as flat as you can get it go straight down cut across and get that little roll of paint okay now then lets take and just Sparkle some color right over this little
Bob Ross,mountain look at that look at that let it go there see by not over mixing your paint you get those spots that are a little bit Pinker some are a little whiter people think you work forever trying to
Bob Ross,get that and its one of those happy accidents you dont really have to do a thing except let it go there maybe maybe back here yep you knew there was little little touch there take some white little
Bob Ross,phalo blue mix it together there all right now that well use that for a shadow color once again pull it out very flat cut across and get our little roll of paint okay put this shadow in no pressure
Bob Ross,no pressure look there just let it slide right down the mountain no pressure its barely coring the canvas see well put some of the Shadows in then well come back pick up some more of the highlight
Bob Ross,color and now we can begin putting in all kinds of little bumps and crevices and you know all those little things that make your Mountain interesting and wherever you want them look at that you can
Bob Ross,put them wherever there if you if you learn to do mountains itll teach you to use this knife I dont know of any single thing that you can do that will do more to teach you control of the knife than
Bob Ross,making mountains there Im using the little knife here cuz it sort of sneaks into those small areas much better put in a few Shadows now some people like to put the shadows in first and then the
Bob Ross,highlights some dont whichever way works for you thats the right way and thats all that counts okay need a little Shadow here too you were going to let me just sneak on by without putting one in
Bob Ross,then i have been in trouble then you laughed at me there we go and all were doing here is just tapping to create the illusion of mist just tap follow the angles I know you hear me say that over and
Bob Ross,over but its so important so very important there look at that mist down at the base of that mountain son of my gun it just FL boats there in the sky yeah let me show you here think Ive showed you
Bob Ross,this before but its worth repeating maybe sometimes you like to create the illusion of another plane in your Mountain all you have to do is take a little the shadow color look at that see there see
Bob Ross,how that brings a whole another projection out on your Mountain there little tricks like that will make your paintings stand out from the average painting thats what makes your painting special there
Bob Ross,we go here and there wherever okay wash the brush give him a good Shake now good clean dry brush gently gently gently bring all that together there we are see and it creates a whole another plane on
Bob Ross,your Mountain okay lets take we got some lavender color here well just use that put a little white with it there we are about that Shade thats good okay let me clean my knife here Ill grab Ill
Bob Ross,use a 1-in brush what the heck you can use any old thing here 2in brush you work fine or a fan brush still using a lavender color though I want to put the indication back here some Happ little
Bob Ross,Foothills there they go see there you can turn the brush sort of sidewards and pull down to make them like that or if you want more individualized tops you can turn it vertically either way see just
Bob Ross,try it and see which kind of effects that you like there I dont ever want to tell you theres one set rule to do anything because if it works for you thats the rule it works its good there I went
Bob Ross,to school for so many years with art instructors that would tell me now it has to be done this way or its not right shoot anyway you can get the effect that you want is right there we are pull
Bob Ross,straight down straight down then lightly go across and you have instant ref sections and then well take some liquid white Im going to put the least little touch of azard and Crimson in it just to
Bob Ross,give it a touch of pink there okay got across it lets go right up here now then lets put in a happy little water line back here just act like youre trying to literally cut a hole right through the
Bob Ross,canvas look at there see there a little bit of a touch of pink just adds a little warmth to it just a little warmth to it if you want a little Ripple go right out here there if you want a little
Bob Ross,Ripple and I was in the military I had a friend that had a lot of Ripple there we go we wont we wont talk about that all right lets have some fun shoot lets see here well take some blue and some
Bob Ross,Crimson going to make a a dark lavender color clean off the knife well use the same old dirty fan brush it doesnt matter doesnt matter all right load the fan brush full lets have us a happy little
Bob Ross,evergreen tree and he lives right there does now does now this is just a lavender color see just sort of back and forth theying for pushing downward there see that lets give him a little friend down

Bob Ross,reflection down here in the water there we go see okay now we take our Big Brush and we grab that now the canvas is wet so this will move look at that can you imagine trying to do that on a dry canvas
Bob Ross,well youd be an Agony City and youd be mad at me about now I going touch a little bit of the liquid white titanium white be right back get a little Crimson put in there I want a tiny bit of pink in
Bob Ross,it lets go right up into here and Im just going to push in some highlights right on some of these little grassy areas there we go just a few little things right there back to my li liquid white and

Bob Ross,world Im going to have a big Evergreen lives right there take the brush use just the corner and begin working it back and forth now look how that dark shows up against that light background at that
Bob Ross,spectacular that is spectacular and if youre out selling your paintings that son of a gun boy that that brings that happy Buck home people like that it really looks good dark against light light
Bob Ross,against dark here we are I get carried away sometime please put up with me there we go little more paint and well just keep right on going there theres another one now you can make these with a one
Bob Ross,or the 2 in Brush whatever I just happened to have a dirty fan brush so I thought Id use it and then lets get crazy over here well we got crazy theres a giant evergreen a big Rascal there we go and
Bob Ross,all youre doing is pushing down with a fan brush just pushing down let and go and go and go May maybe he lives right on down we dont care about there maybe theres another one there and in your
Bob Ross,painting you put as many or as few as you want sort of look at it and decide every single painting is different we really are not trying to teach you to copy or to draw lines and fill in the lines
Bob Ross,were were trying to teach you creativity trying to teach you how to create as you paint theres Freedom there scary what you can do Im going to take the Big Brush go right into the same color lets
Bob Ross,go back up here maybe theres some little bushes that live right out oh it kill my nice reflection but we know its there so its all right see well put a little reflection there then pull it
Bob Ross,straight down straight down and go lightly across but another little Bush lives there see you just put plane after plane after plane that creates the illusion of distance and depth in your painting
Bob Ross,there we go now lets go on this side do some of that maybe these almost come together there we are and push in a little more okay need a little reflection under this one straight down and then
Bob Ross,lightly across there maybe this comes right on out here who knows who knows long as it makes you happy tell you what lets take some dark Sienna little white in it Im just going to mix it a little
Bob Ross,cut off our little roll of paint and Im going right up here and into these trees I want to put the indication here and there of a little trunk there just here and there because you dont see the

Bob Ross,small amount of the phthalo blue just a small amount small amount reach up here and grab a touch of Prussian Blue just going to mix them together on the same brush okay lets go right up here now then
Bob Ross,just using our standard little crisscross Strokes lets lets just begin dancing in a happy little Sky just let the brush play and have fun just bounce around there we are you really dont have to
Bob Ross,plan its just sort of let it happen and and look at what happens and use it learn to use whatever happens now then without cleaning the brush Im going to add the least little touch least little
Bob Ross,touch doesnt take much of phthalo green okay now then I just want to add a little touch of the green here just to Sparkle and brighten the sky just to give him some nice colors there just let that
Bob Ross,old brush play and bounce there we go now then while we have the old brush dirty lets take some oh well take some Prussian Blue phthalo blue phthalo green just all of them same colors we used in the
Bob Ross,sky and lets put in the indication of a little touch of water down here there just pull from the outside in like so and I dont know exactly how much water were going to have or even where its
Bob Ross,going to be so we just cover it all up and whatever we dont want well put something else over it cuz we can do anything into our world we can do anything okay lets wash our brush scrub it off there
Bob Ross,we are Im going to shake off the excess and cover the whole studio again now then youll see my cameramen they are and Camera ladies they are just they got funny freckles all over your face there now
Bob Ross,with clean dry brush clean dry brush Im just going to blend the sky now you can blend it to any degree of softness that you want I like to leave some of these little patchy areas in the sky but if
Bob Ross,you dont want them in yours blend them out the more you blend it the smoother and softer itll become down here just gently go across that easy and we can wash our old brush one more time Shake It
Bob Ross,Out Here we are okay tell you what today lets use the old fan brush go right into some titanium white load a lot of lot of paint into the bristles lot of paint lot of paint lets build a happy little
Bob Ross,cloud in the sky May There lives a cloud right there wherever you want it wherever just drop him in its your sky so you make the decision where your clouds live there maybe yeah theres a little
Bob Ross,friend that lives right there right there right there maybe another one right over in here you can just get crazy and fill the whole Sky up full of clouds and thats all right so all right with a good
Bob Ross,dry brush use just the top corner of the 2in brush to very lightly blend see all youre blending is the base then you lift it fluff it tease it and very lightly see there beautiful little Cloud that
Bob Ross,easy same thing fluff it up give it a little blending there fluff it and blend it okay maybe in your world maybe theres another little Cloud lives in front of this one you can put him in I suggest
Bob Ross,though if youre going to put layers of cloud on clouds on top of one another that you do the one thats farthest away first get it totally finished and then come back and put the other one over the
Bob Ross,top of it certainly certainly makes it easier there okay if you do that many clouds and youre painting itll thatll give you some good practice doing clouds should never have problems with them
Bob Ross,again fluff it and then very lightly two hairs and some air there we go flap it and blend it now we can just gently blend the entire sky and already youve got a wh full of clouds all right now there
Bob Ross,we clean off our fan brush and just wipe the fan brush on a on a paper towel to dry it or a soft rag whatever you happen to have okay lets take shoot lets get this old big brush out here and take
Bob Ross,some black some blue we just mix them on the brush it doesnt matter vany Brown be right back lizard and Crimson well throw some of that in there shoot a little sap green too what the heck might as
Bob Ross,well use all these nice dark colors tap some color into the bristles lets go right up here now you have to make some big decisions maybe theres some happy little trees that live back here just take
Bob Ross,the corner of the brush and begin tapping start at the base cuz thats your darkest area and work upward work upward upward upward and begin begin creating some shape and form in your tree there we go
Bob Ross,see think about individual little trees though where do they live give them names if necessary thats all right there is one look at him look at there he is there okay maybe we just let that work its
Bob Ross,way right on down heres shoot theres another one you knew he was there didnt you maybe thats a nice one he comes we like C you know trees grow however make them happy just just put them in your
Bob Ross,world there we go lets just keep going think tou fun maybe over in here maybe over here more trees there we are maybe this one comes we have black C make a decision drop it in anywhere you want him
Bob Ross,to be thats where hell be there but that quick you blocked him a whole Forest back here nearly now then while we have that color on the brush we can decide back here where our Reflections are going
Bob Ross,to live grab pull straight down straight down you can drop them in then pull them see there that easy try not to kill that little bright spot right there thats pretty there you go look at that now
Bob Ross,very lightly just go across just gives it a watery appearance and you can push these and wiggle them is that fantastic one ni traditional painter Reflections used to drive me crazy and now its one of
Bob Ross,the easiest things that you can do so simple lets put some little tree trunks in there Ill take paint thinner let me get some more thinner here paint thinner on my liner brush and I want to mix this
Bob Ross,till its thin like ink lets go right up here and now here and there just put the indication of a happy little tree trunk and some Limbs and sticks theres some and grow in here some people will find
Bob Ross,it easier to start start at the top and pull down some people find it easier to start at the bottom and lift up doesnt matter doesnt doesnt matter theres no rule if it works then thats the right
Bob Ross,way okay maybe theres one sort of yah over here y that means its bent there okay over on this side we need some indications and each one doesnt have to have one just wherever you think they should
Bob Ross,be theyre just all kinds of little things growing in there and you you can take a little bit of titanium white thin down and put a few of them in here and there that are light color and they really
Bob Ross,stand out against that dark see against your painting character people think you really work for a long time to put all them little rascals in there lets put some on the other side that looking good
Bob Ross,I known they were that good Id have put a bunch in there to start with there look at that boy them Little Devils just jump right out at you now then clean my brush Im going to get a a 1in brush
Bob Ross,today what the heck lets go Im going to drag it through some of the dark color first just to get some paint on it some Browns and greens and all that then I going to go into the cad yellow be right
Bob Ross,back get a little sap green on it load a lot of color into the brush but tap it see you can see see it push there tap it to load it okay now then lets go up here and begin putting in some highlights
Bob Ross,on some of these little Devils think about form and shape dont just throw them in at random they wont look right no matter how you paint highlights on bushes and trees think about them as
Bob Ross,individuals think about them its easy just to throw them in at random but thats thats not the way little trees grow go out in your yard and look at them theres theres a plan there nature doesnt
Bob Ross,make any mistakes it happens for a reason theres Limbs and things in there that project out there think about them create all these little shapes there Im had a little yellow ochre here and there
Bob Ross,little Indian Yellow s green CAD yellow just whatever even touch a little bright red here and there just make some pretty little things now over here on this one lets give him I dont want him left
Bob Ross,out over here think about form and shape though I know you get tired of hearing that but to me thats so important anybody can just hit it random but your paintings are special theyre special set you
Bob Ross,apart from everybody else because you you pay attention to little details that makes you special and if if youre selling your paintings thatll cause your paintings to sell while somebody else is are
Bob Ross,sitting there going nowhere there we go for years and years I traveled with art shows all over the country demonstrating and selling my works oh and some sometimes other painters would get so angry
Bob Ross,with me because Id be selling paintings just as fast as I could turn them out and they would sit there all day brooding over these little paintings and If Only They had just taken the time to figure
Bob Ross,out why they were selling rather than being angry you dont have to get angry if somebodys doing better than you are study them theyve got a secret find out what it is shoot dont get angry if you
Bob Ross,get angry it just Wast a lot of energy tell you what tell you what lets get crazy today Im going to take take a little white Im going reach to be right back get a little touch of phthalo blue since
Bob Ross,this is my world I can do anything I want to do here Im going to go up here and maybe back in here theres a little Bush thats sort of bluish I just like the looks of that see there now if you dont
Bob Ross,want to Bush that color in your world dont putty man but today I just feel so super I want to put some bright shin little colors here and Im going add a little lizard and Crimson to that little
Bob Ross,Crimson make o theres a beautiful color beautiful color okay now then maybe look at that just makes you happy when you see bright little colors like that you just cant help it there we go and
Bob Ross,painting it does nothing else for you it should make you happy should bring something in into your life that you didnt have there before then its worthwhile then its good its good anything that
Bob Ross,makes you happy it doesnt hurt anybody else its got to be good okay lets go right up here going to add a little dirt little Bank back here using Straight bandik Brown just straight old brown right
Bob Ross,along here see wherever you want them to go take a little brown and a little white mix it together and come right back in here add a touch a highlight right here and there there we go just enough to
Bob Ross,get it to stand out little touch of liquid white and put a little bit of that lavender color in that too well make it pretty see pull it out flat and then cut across just get a little bit on your
Bob Ross,knife go right up here cut had a hole right through the cams just get up there and saw it just really work it there and thats a light area between the darks that makes it stand out a little bit shoot
Bob Ross,we might even we might even get in here and get crazy cuz we can do anything in our world maybe theres some more bushes and trees here see maybe theres a little projection that comes out here if you
Bob Ross,want one put him in if you dont leave him out can do anything there see there he is put a little reflection straight down go across come back with our 1-in brush get a little color on him just tap a
Bob Ross,little color into him lets go back up here now then need a few highlights on this little bush or tree whatever he is here there we go see that there he is but Le some dark car carry is in there
Bob Ross,sometimes this gets working so well its almost a natural tendency just to to cover up everything and if you do that if you lose those dark areas and your little bushes are not going to be individuals
Bob Ross,and theyre going to be very flat look like you cut them out of newspaper just glued them up there and we want we want action in lifeo this is too nice see there but layer after layer after layer then
Bob Ross,we need a little dirt into there got to have something for him to sit on little white little brown put in a little touch of highlight right in there I cant and we can take a a little fan brush with
Bob Ross,some of that same color on it and just push upward thatll bring it all together cover up those edges look at there come back with our liquid white cut us in a little water line so were go and with a
Bob Ross,clean knife Im going to just scrape in the indication here and there of a few little sticks and twigs just mainly in the dark cares there see that looks like a lot of little detail people are really
Bob Ross,think you worked hard to put all that in they think you use a that little one haired brush and did them one at a time dont you tell them any difference thats our secret thats our secret okay tell
Bob Ross,you what get some more blue and some black and some vany brown and whatever other color sap green lizard Crimson we just mix them all in here okay now then maybe this comes right down like that see
Bob Ross,there just use the corner of the brush and tap in whatever you want okay if that comes out here obviously its going to be a reflection you knew that see go across you need to put that reflection in
Bob Ross,Im going to bring this down put it in before you come around its hard to sneak it back in there you have to make some decisions see maybe thats going to come right out like that itd be hard to
Bob Ross,sneak back in there and stick that reflection in but you got it already you got it you got it there now then we can come right back find my brush there it is lets go back into our highlight colors
Bob Ross,the yellows all the different yellows and little bit of sap green and we can look at there go right back in here and just begin adding all kinds of little little bright things up here one Bush at a
Bob Ross,time dont get in too big a hurry we got all day were not in a hurry take your time speed will come automatically the more you practice the faster youll become without even thinking about it dont
Bob Ross,worry about speed at first if youre painting along with me if you have a video record the shows and play them back at your own speed so you can stop them and start them and as you know here I have a
Bob Ross,very limited amount of time to work so I have to do them sort of quick if I over 30 minutes they they have no sense of humor we got one cameraman here it weighs about 250 he comes out and drags me off
Bob Ross,the set but at home you can do anything that you want to do see working layers layer after layer after layer I know what we need lets take let me find a fan brush shoot thats just thats just a
Bob Ross,perfect place perfect place to have a little path cuz youd want to get back in in there in the little path there it comes and if it goes right over your bushes thats all right there it comes right
Bob Ross,out through there see it sort of goes back take that same brush well pick up a little white on it there see just let it graze over the top of that dark there you go little little way to get back in
Bob Ross,there got to have way to catch that big trout that lives back here in the water there Im not a very good fisherman I love to fish but I catch a fish and I put a Band-Aid on him and put him back in
Bob Ross,the water and wish him well and hope I can have the opportunity to catch him again next time I come there just like so maybe a few little things right in here okay now we can take our liner brush Im
Bob Ross,going put a little thinner on it and lets just put the indication here and there a few little sticks and twigs that are growing out of this just a few things here and there okay back to our Brown put
Bob Ross,a little dirt under this side dont want them left out little brown and white for highlight and then a little little water line underneath that cleans up the bottom and puts a little light area
Bob Ross,between all of it there look at that okay take a clean knife and just scrape in a few little sticks here and there like so see and these things show different planes and they create the illusion of
Bob Ross,depth and distance in your painting and Im a nut for that I think the depth in the painting is so important take tell you what lets bring the camera right up here close Im going to take the contact
Bob Ross,paper off and lets see what we have and grab this and heres the Moment of Truth oh isnt that pretty son of a gun Im always fascinated with those theyre so nice so nice tell you what lets do we
Bob Ross,got a minute or two left here so lets get crazy maybe this comes right on out I like to bring them right out of the right out of the oval sometime so here well just bring a little bit of the color
Bob Ross,right on out like so this is scary too when you do this this is your bravery test this will check you out see there okay now then we take our fan brush put some brown on it and first thing Lets do
Bob Ross,lets just extend our path our path comes right on out like that take a little bit of white put a highlight on it just barely grazing barely Grazy now then take her heres a few little bushes and they
Bob Ross,come over the path by allowing some of those bushes to come literally over the top of the path it pushes a path down into the painting makes him look like he fits in there there we go see just sort of
Bob Ross,let those just feather right on off into nothing there Here Comes one there he is there he is it unbelievable that just using a corner of a 1 in Brush you can do all that you can thats the easiest
Bob Ross,way I have ever found to make little bushes of a grass series lets get crazy we got we got to get crazy Im going fake Brown on the fan brush load a lot of color lot of color now then maybe right
Bob Ross,here you know me I like these old big trees and Im going to let this tree project right out of the painting soon and he lives right there and hes got a friend hes got a friend and he lives there
Bob Ross,see now then well take a little touch of white and lets lets just say maybe these are birch trees touch them give them a little little round where pull there you go just give him a little little
Bob Ross,pull dont get too big there okay now then a little paint thinner on my liner brush well make some more of that paint is thin like ink okay lets go up in here and now then lets just put a tree limb
Bob Ross,here and there and in your tree you put as many or as few as you want just let them go wherever you think they should live now if your paint does not flow add some more thinner to it cuz a thin paint
Bob Ross,will slide right over all this maybe that one goes right on off we dont know there there see there Im going to put some leaves on there so you dont have to be too careful andless maybe you want the
Bob Ross,tree in your painting to be an old dead tree then you then you got to be a little bit more careful there okay maybe theres one right there wherever wherever and we just use the old Big Brush what the
Bob Ross,heck here and there I just want to put the indication of a little leaf or two just an indication here and there Im not looking for a lot of shape yet well come back and highlight them in a second
Bob Ross,there you need that dark in order for your light to show now we take some light color Im going to dip the brush into the least little amount of paint thinner to thin the paint come right along in
Bob Ross,here look at that look at them shine in the Sun there they go at that super I love these paintings where they extend outside of the oval I hope you try them and youre not limited to ovals you can do
Bob Ross,any shape that you want to do any shape that you want to do just enjoy them and I think with that were going to call that a completed painting from all of us here happy painting and God Music bless
Bob Ross,Music Music
Bob Ross,hi Im glad you could join me today you know in the past we had a young artist on the show that was so fantastic we got so many cards and letters talking about how great this young man was weve
Bob Ross,decided to bring him back and today its my absolute pleasure to introduce you to my son Steve and Steve a little devil can paint he travels all over the country and he teaches literally hundreds of
Bob Ross,people The Joy of Painting and Ive asked him to come here today and show you what he can do in just a couple of minutes so Steve if youd show them how to do a fantastic little painting Ill get off
Bob Ross,here and Ill see you at the end of the show okay thanks a lot dad uh what Im going to try to do today is a waterfall scene and I have a few different things in it that I usually dont put in like a
Bob Ross,bushy tree over on this side and a birch tree over on this side and U like I said before therell probably be a huge waterfall right down here in front so what Im going to start out with is a little
Bob Ross,bit of phthalo blue in the sky and Im just going to smash that straight down into the brush try to get a nice even distribution and if you want a real dark sky youre going to need to use a lot of
Bob Ross,paint and of course if you like the more light soft subdued Sky then you just use very little and kind of a soft pressure but I like the dark shape so Im going to try to put a lot of pressure on it
Bob Ross,and generally when I load the brush I always will go right up in into a corner and start there and then work into the center and as you do that the brush picks up the liquid white and gets lighter the
Bob Ross,sky gets lighter automatically towards the center of the painting and thats what youre looking for so Ill just throw in something like that and then maybe Ill go into a little bit of phthalo blue
Bob Ross,and phthalo green just a small amount of that phthalo green and down here in the water well just put some straight horizontal Strokes in now Ill come back with a clean dry brush and try to blend all
Bob Ross,this out saving that light source in the center at least a little bit if I can mainly what Im trying to do here is just add pressure on the areas where the dark and the light come together when you
Bob Ross,get through blending your Sky you really shouldnt be able to see where the light stops in the dark begins so you should end up with something similar to that and then down here in the water you just
Bob Ross,just make your straight horizontal strokes and try to save a little bit of that light there too okay maybe in this one well have a mountain so what You want to do is get your pallet knife and mix a
Bob Ross,few colors together vany Brown uh Prussian Blue and maybe just a little bit of azarin crimson too with that sort of looking for a dark purple mix that up real good then come up to the canvas and maybe
Bob Ross,right here start in with a real rough rugged Mountain shape and you want to be careful not to get too wild because if you get your Mountain too large about the only thing you can do is nail another
Bob Ross,canvas on top of this one and start over but say you didnt like a part on it like right here you could just make it a little bit bigger so if its your first Mountain Id recommend starting off with
Bob Ross,kind of a small one and then making it bigger and bigger until you like it now once I get the shape in Im going to try to scrape most of that paint away and come back with my big brush and pull that
Bob Ross,right out want to be careful not to get too close to those top edges okay and then maybe a little snow just using titanium white picking up a little on the knife like this and just right on top of
Bob Ross,those edges closest to the Sun very light pressure and right over here maybe just a little bit kind of like a glacier formation or something and then when you go in for your shadows youd want to use
Bob Ross,white with a little bit of press and blue its a real simple Shadow color and kind of leave the paint marbled a little bit where you can see some of those dark blue streaks in there and remember a
Bob Ross,shadow is a reflection of the Highlight so youd want to have it break over here just like it did on the other side so use real light pressure and maybe even the small blade on the knife every once in
Bob Ross,a while if youre working in a real tight area right here kind of pull down with the Contour of the mountain if the mountain didnt go straight across then you would want to pull it you know down at
Bob Ross,that same angle if you see the dark line on the back of the mountain coming down like this thats the same way you want to make the shadow so Id come over like this a little and then Music drop
Bob Ross,most important is leaving your dark areas youll notice that I harp on that through the entire painting on on every single step we do Ill say always leave those dark areas there it takes dark to show
Bob Ross,Music light okay and then down at the very bottom of your Mountain you can use your Big Brush and just make a little bit of mist just by tapping up into it and then kind of lift to get rid of those
Bob Ross,tap marks okay now lets say we wanted a few Foothills in there maybe wed use some sap green and some van Dy Brown together get the yuckiest green color you can get out of this because you know how
Bob Ross,trees in the distance look real dark and and kind of sappy thats why we call it sap green okay and then mix some white with that all were looking for here is a couple different values of green real
Bob Ross,dark green and maybe just a drop of paint thinner okay just come up here with the brush and touch real lightly doesnt take much pressure right here its mostly just the shapes youre looking for and
Bob Ross,dont be afraid to run over the bottom of that mountain but I wouldnt recommend coming up too much higher than I did because you want to save just a little bit of that mist back in there makes the
Bob Ross,mountain look more distant okay and once you throw in a nice little hilly shape you come back in with a clean dry 1 in Brush and lift that up and these will be your little trees in the distance I was
Bob Ross,just recently in Pennsylvania doing some classes and this is about all you see out there in Pennsylvania is these Rolling Hills its a big change from Indiana now down at the bottom of your Foothill
Bob Ross,youd want to mist It Out by taking your Big Brush and use the tip of your big brush and smash in thats how you get that mist the reason I said use the tip of the brush is cuz when you use the side
Bob Ross,you seem to get a straight line of mist across here instead of a variation so you got to be careful about little things like that and maybe Id want to make some rows coming in front of that one so I
Bob Ross,just add a little bit more of the brown and the sap green to that same color and say this one comes down in front of that one just make it happen as long as you work from back to front through the
Bob Ross,entire painting you really cant go wrong but you never want to put in three or four Foo Hills at a time and then go back cuz when you were blending the bottom of this one you might come in and go
Bob Ross,whoops and hit the top of that one if you werent real careful but we can fix anything so were not really worried about it okay lets take a little bit of real dark this time just pure sap green and
Bob Ross,vany brown and put one more row right in here making sure we save some of that mist though and notice how the incline of the land lessens as you come forward my Mountain was real high and bold and
Bob Ross,that first row of Foothills was kind of kind of high and rolling and now this next row is just sort of flat that gives the illusion that this is real far away just going through my my same steps over
Bob Ross,and over again notice when Im making this Mist Im really pounding in hard you have to get tough with these brushes theyre so big you have to convince them to do the right thing okay now maybe well
Bob Ross,go for a row of dark foliage up front fandy Brown and sap green just like before thatll be our mother color for the rest of the painting well be using that to put our Dark Shadows in for everything
Bob Ross,now what Im doing is just pulling the brush through the paint and coming up and just smashing it right in there so even if youve never painted before this is really simple to do because no matter
Bob Ross,which way you twist or turn the brush its always going to come out looking good and kind of make this drop a little bit on the right hand side so it looks more like a Round Lake up front and then
Bob Ross,Ill take my Big Brush pull some Reflections down go across see and now Ill throw some land in with Van Dyk brown one more time on the knife first you just start off by touching real lightly and then
Bob Ross,you pull to the left hand side kind of making little Hills here too real flat ones though and a little bit of brown and white for highlights could even throw some dark ciner or something in there if
Bob Ross,you wanted to bright red Works nice for that too and of course every time you have something above the water you have to pull a reflection out of it and go across that one also now say I wanted to
Bob Ross,come in and put some colors on this foliage back here Id probably use a little bit of green first because you do see a lot more green in nature than any other Music color so a little bit of sap
Bob Ross,green with cadum yellow makes kind of a nice light green color yellowish green and on this part you use lots of paint on the brush but just barely touch to get that crystally effect and you can start
Bob Ross,changing your colors around can use any of your three yellows and maybe as I get out to the corners Id want a little bit more subdued color so Id start adding more green and more red that gives the
Bob Ross,impression the sunlight shining right down in the center more there now a little bit of liquid white on the knife and just kind of smear it in on the pet like this and then wipe your knife off and cut
Bob Ross,right across that just like that trying to get a little bit just on the very blade end of the blade now when you do that the roll of uh liquid whes going to look like its on the top of your knife but
Bob Ross,its actually right on the very end of it and thats about the only way I found to get a good amount of pain on there and remember water lines have to be straight even when youre coming around a bend
Bob Ross,still water always lies Music flat okay lets see down here lets use a little bit of phthalo blue and a little bit of press and blue together see what kind of color we get out of that now this is
Bob Ross,on the Big Brush and Im just going to start out by coming up here and pulling out a big shape pulling out one big blue shape this will be the start of our waterfall smooth this out and back back of
Bob Ross,it a little bit here okay Im going to use my fan brush with liquid white and titanium white on it and just throw in about six separate Strokes here okay this will be the first one and each individual
Bob Ross,one kind of overlaps the next just a tiny bit and you do need to use plenty of liquid white for this its kind of hard to get that paint to flow on there just right and its really not a good idea to
Bob Ross,go back over your Strokes again little bit of movement in the water in back of it here okay now since that waterfall is just kind of sitting out in the middle of nowhere lets bring in some Cliffs
Bob Ross,from the sides make it look like some banks got washed away you have to use plenty of Van Dy Brown for this part right here and you just kind of smear it on in sort of a c shape shape if you notice
Bob Ross,that Im kind of making it like a overhanging cliff shape so you just fill that whole area in over there and then over here you do the same thing make sure you cover up enough of the waterfall though
Bob Ross,on the sides okay and then some more van Dy brown and white together for highlights on top of that just like the dirt in the background and just grab on top of each shape and pull right AC AC cross
Bob Ross,and automatically you got the top of your cliff and you just kind of decide where you want them and then sometimes the neat effect is to take a clean knife and push up into it and pull down and that
Bob Ross,really starts making it look like a cliff okay now say we wanted a little foliage around these Cliffs thats easy enough were just going to kind of smash it in there like we did before in the
Bob Ross,background maybe a bush here some grass down here you know whatever just whatever you see in your minds eye thats the way you want to put it on the canvas now I might need a little bit of dark blue
Bob Ross,shadow down here here too that way when I go in with my splashes and stuff well have some real dark underground there to look good this is how you do those splashes you just run your fan brush
Bob Ross,through the white hit it on your pallet a couple times to open up those bristles and then come right up here and start firing it in kind of make some sound effects while youre doing this too some
Bob Ross,splashy sound effects that helps a lot okay maybe Ill come back in here and highlight this foliage now getting into some brighter colors up here in the foreground you know the the suns out real
Bob Ross,bright today and maybe it hit even harder up here in the front on the left hand side putting in this Fage is probably the easiest part of this whole technique you just throw it right in there and
Bob Ross,leave enough dark shapes and it just comes out like you like it and maybe Ill show you how to do one big tree using that same bushy idea and well stick it right over here now dont forget to leave
Bob Ross,some places for the birds to sit you got to leave some open areas on your tree here and just bring that right down maybe with a knife and some van Dy Brown a little trunk now you dont need to get
Bob Ross,real detailed on these trunks cuz most of its going to be covered up anyway just a little bit of that van Dy brown and white again to highlight that and for some reason they always look better with a
Bob Ross,few little sticks in there that goes for everywhere in your foliage and everything okay and how about a nice bright color some cadum yellow and some bright red with it makes a real nice Orange
Bob Ross,Laughter you can certainly tell what season this is all these leaves changing colors and maybe a bush to cover up his feet and usually on this painting I like to put an island down here just to
Bob Ross,break things up a little bit just on this one side and of course you need to bring a little bit of grass down on that too well other than a couple more little grassy things I think this ones about
Bob Ross,done probably call that finished okay well you understand now why this young man is in such demand as a teacher and why Im so proud of him hes a fantastic painter and once again Im proud to call
Bob Ross,him my son and Steve thanks for being with us today thanks Dad and we look forward to seeing you again happy painting and God bless a Music Music
Bob Ross,hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me today today I thought wed do a fantastic little painting together so I tell you what lets start out and have run all the colors across the screen
Bob Ross,that you need to paint along with me while theyre doing that let me tell you what Ive already done up here today I have a I have sort of a weird canvas as you can see Ive taken some black gesso on
Bob Ross,a standard old 18 by 24in canvas here and painted these dark areas with black gesso then Ive allowed the black gesso to dry completely now in the light area Ive just put a little bit of liquid white
Bob Ross,and just blended it out in the dark area you caught me putting on a little bit of uh this is a mixture of phthalo blue sap green and Van Dy Brown I want a dull dirty green color and you can sort of
Bob Ross,test it before you start and all were doing here is just covering all the dark areas this this color is very transparent so its still looks black and with that I want to show you how to do a scene
Bob Ross,that looks like youre deep in the woods you know you ever walked in the Deep Woods and the trees are all hanging over and its its quiet and the little squirrels are playing and everything thats
Bob Ross,what were going to do today so let me just get all this covered all were looking for is just a nice coat of the dark mixture that we made and now while we have that on the brush lets begin thinking
Bob Ross,about some general basic tree shapes that live up in here just take the corner of the brush and then begin bringing them right over going out into the liquid white all were looking for here is just
Bob Ross,very basic shapes think about the big tree thats hanging over here see and you can pick up a little bit of color look at there just bring those shapes out well come back and well put a lot of
Bob Ross,highlights and stuff in there right now all were looking for are very basic little shapes there just as many or as few as you want in your world okay maybe theres a bush that lives right here see
Bob Ross,that easy we can put a just a happy little tree there maybe hes got a little friend here who knows wherever you want him okay now over here heres another big tree LM it seems to be protruding over
Bob Ross,and when youre putting this black gesso on just sort of in your mind to have an idea of how you want these trees hanging there and whatever happens we use there we go see there in my mind Im
Bob Ross,beginning to see huge trees that are hanging over here and maybe theres a little light coming through oh this be a super place to go and hide all right few more bushes and trees down in here but
Bob Ross,already youve got the basic shapes here that youre looking for see now maybe I tell you what lets do lets get crazy I want a bigger tree right here in the center and in your world if you want a
Bob Ross,tree to grow all you have to do is make it grow a little bit maybe theres some little shapes you can see way back here that are little trees in between there were not looking for a lot of detail in
Bob Ross,there but already thats beginning to give you the appearance of a lot of mist and things happening okay maybe up in here way back in the distance somewhere theres a little something wherever and you
Bob Ross,can just here and there put all kinds of little soft things there we go now then lets have some fun lets take the scrip liner brush we dip it into some paint thinner and Ill go back into some vanc
Bob Ross,brown and that same color that we just we just made the little trees out of you want this paint to be thin like ink turn the brush that look of bristles and brings the bristles to a nice sharp Point
Bob Ross,okay now maybe back in here theres just the indication here and there of some little tree trunks and Limbs and sticks and twigs and all kinds of little things happening there just s to make a
Bob Ross,decision where you think they should live and drop them in so all there is to it there we go see back back in here very light we dont want a lot of detail back in here its too far away we cant see
Bob Ross,a lot of detail theres one theres another one just however many that you want there see you can create all kinds of Illusions here and if you have trouble making this paint flow add a little bit
Bob Ross,more paint thinner if it doesnt flow chances are you dont have quite enough paint thinner on your brush because a thin paint will slide right over here okay looks like weve painted a whole Forest
Bob Ross,already and weve done very little work now then Ill just take a little bit more of the paint thiner and go right into a touch of the titanium white and same thing bring that brush to a nice sharp
Bob Ross,point and then we can put just the indication here and there of some little tree trunks that are a little bit lighter there is that super all right now then lets start having some fun well take a
Bob Ross,1-in brush today and you could do this with your 2-in brush or fan brush I sort of like to use the the old 1in brush Im going to dip it into the least little touch of liquid white just a thin the
Bob Ross,paint a little pull it right through the color be right back Im going to grab a little that dark color we have on the canvas so it turns into a beautiful green there now load a lot of paint into the
Bob Ross,bristles and tap it tap downward downward like that that loads the bristles okay lets go up here now maybe maybe maybe right in here see theres leaves on this tree just happy little leaves and were
Bob Ross,looking for shape here and form dont just throw these in at random think about think about the little limbs that live in there there we go work on one tree or bush at a time you pick up a little
Bob Ross,yellow ochre here and there little Indian yellow maybe right there just sort of look around and see what looks like it ought to be little bushes and trees just begin building all kinds of little
Bob Ross,things in here maybe over here but we dont want to paint all of them leave some of them dark there we go maybe back in here just here and there the indication of a few things dont want a lot of
Bob Ross,detail here but we see these little stems and branches and stuff so we want a few little things that are happening in there but not many not many I dont want to lose that illusion of distance and
Bob Ross,softness back in here there we go already that should begin if youre painting along with me at home you should begin having the the appearance that youre deep in the woods and its just a quiet
Bob Ross,little place so I say this is where all the little rabbits hide and squirrels play I still have a little pet squirrel that lives with me there we built him a great big cage we call it squirrel Hilton
Bob Ross,son of a guns got two stories in it little penous and he he lives quite well hes almost ready to go back to Nature okay just all kinds of little happy things back in here but working layers here do
Bob Ross,one Bush at a time always working forward forward forward and that helps create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting well that looks like some places Ive been in Oregon the we out west
Bob Ross,there where its oh they have all these big Ferns and stuff that grow out in the woods but see how the layers are creating the depth thats whats important it makes your painting really stand out
Bob Ross,there now sometimes we want to make the indication that maybe a little light shining through these trees so Ill show you how to do that well just take the fan brush a little little bit of the cad
Bob Ross,yellow there we are little yellow little green and lets go up in here and just sort of random think where light would shine through just sort of hit it spin it a little bit here and there dont want
Bob Ross,too much of this just spin the brush you can even pick up a little touch of the white if you want to brighten it even more see just hit and spin grind that brush in there youre not going to hurt it
Bob Ross,there we go then with a clean dry 2in brush very lightly you can just blend this Music out see there lets go back over here just sort of blend that out a little bit and when we put some put some
Bob Ross,leaves and stuff on these big trees thatll help give us the impression that theres theres little bits of light shining through there okay lets go back into our yellows and greens with a 1-in brush
Bob Ross,and lets begin working forward on some of these big trees tap some color into the brush now then just touch and tap thats all youre doing is just tapping using the corner of the brush tapping
Bob Ross,tapping and once again think about individual limbs here dont just throw this in at random there we go little yellow ochre once in a while just to change it brighten it up make it stand out its a
Bob Ross,great big tree back in here and were putting some limbs that are going to be in the back then were going to put some trunks on and well put a few more highlights in the foreground there we go see
Bob Ross,just drop these in I like doing these little paintings this black gesso is one of the most fantastic things it opens whole new worlds to you I love the black canvases theyre so fantastic probably
Bob Ross,some of the most Striking Effects in this technique are accomplished on a black canvas okay while were doing that lets go over to the other side on this old tree here well drop in a few things but
Bob Ross,look how color stands out on this you would never get this kind of effect on a white canvas there okay maybe right here i c just sort of think about limbs that live inside this tree think about shape
Bob Ross,and form I know you get tired of hearing me say that but its so important there just one layer after another H you can almost hear the birds in here did you get to see the little blue J I had on a
Bob Ross,couple of the shows in this series white little son again something else I bed him from the bird lady here in M hes a loner bird just Barrow him for day or two at a time there we go now then maybe
Bob Ross,just begin thinking about whats going on in here and whats happening and lets lets take some black I see I see right over in here maybe lets have lets go right up in here maybe theres some tree
Bob Ross,trunks come right down through here there they are and however many trees you want in your world and just put them in this is just straight midnight black just straight old black thats all there is
Bob Ross,to it theres a couple lets put a third one in there maybe theres a little one that lives in here right there among those two big ones and we can take our liner brush paint thinner on it a little
Bob Ross,bit of the black want this color once again to be thin like ink so itll flow on the canvas and we can come right back in here and lets begin just putting the indication here and there of some happy
Bob Ross,little tree limbs that live out in the woods there as I mentioned earlier if you have trouble making your paint flow add a little bit more paint thinner to it there we Music go theres one it comes
Bob Ross,right over in there however whatever painting is so individual you sort of look at your painting and you make it the way you want it we each see nature through different eyes okay wash the old brush
Bob Ross,now then lets put some highlights on top of that Im going back into the same color same old 1in brush and Ive just going to add a little brighter yellow I want this to stand out a little better cuz
Bob Ross,its going to be in front here there we go and we can put some happy little things on there even this now our yellows are made to a thinner consist y than the other colors but if you have trouble
Bob Ross,making it stick then add a little touch of the paint thinner to the yellow and then itll come right off your brush there we are is that fantastic and you can do this theres no big secret to it we
Bob Ross,give you all the secrets right here on the show all you need is the desire little imagination and some practice just practice CCE a little there we are see and that pushes those tree trunks right back
Bob Ross,into that mass of trees here that easy okay let me find the Big 2-in Brush lets go right into a little bit more of this yellow maybe theres some land here Im going to take the 2-in brush and just
Bob Ross,tap pick up a little dark color so my green will get darker there we go now tap it give it a little push push push maybe theres some land here some soft little grassy areas just take the 2in brush
Bob Ross,and all you have to do is just tap just tap just like so see there there we are and we can begin creating the illusion of just Little Hills back here start to Fest away and work forward forward
Bob Ross,forward there we go just layer after layer after layer and this can be as soft as velvet see I should have put it in first before I put these trees but you just put it right over them then well pull
Bob Ross,the trees back through there little bit more right in there there we go little Indian yellow little touch of the bright red here and there oo thats nice gives it sort of an orangey flavor and maybe
Bob Ross,over here this one here will come right down and right in the foreground comes right in the front of that one you have that much power though you can make the land go anywhere that you want it to go
Bob Ross,in your world anywhere that you want it to go there this is where I want to live can tell already okay maybe up in here lets put a little Bush it lives right here in the corner just sort to bring all
Bob Ross,that together still just using the corner of the 1in brush and a little bit of black I want to bring these trees back down into the painting here I cut them off with the grass but I want them to live
Bob Ross,right there so we can pull them right back in the foreground that easy you can move mountains you can change trees anything that you want to do here anything that you want to do that easy all right I
Bob Ross,tell you what lets have fun I love water I love water I would put it in just about everything that I paint lets take just a little plain titanium white and lets have us a little Pond here just take
Bob Ross,the white and pull straight down its going to pick up that color thats already on the canvas and automatically automatically were going to have a nice happy little Pond or whatever you want here
Bob Ross,little bit of water there all Im using is just straight titanium white but its important that you pull straight down when you do this even if you put your brush crooked pull straight down otherwise
Bob Ross,it it just wont look right just wont look right now after you get this in very gently very gently come across and these lines should be straight across there ant that fantastic that you can create
Bob Ross,water that easy you can you can I tell people all the time on this piece of canvas you can do anything that you want to do and you really can this is total freedom here Im using a little dark Sienna
Bob Ross,little white little van Dy Brown Put it on the knife lets go right up here and lets just put the indication in here of a touch of land and all Im doing is just rubbing very hard just pushing that
Bob Ross,color right into the canvas I want to look like like little sand bars or dirts inting that here this water in my mind is not very deep its not very deep its out here in the woods its just maybe a
Bob Ross,maybe a little puddle from a big rain or something I dont want it to be real deep take a little titanium white and to that Im going to add the least little touch of dark SE I want it to be light but
Bob Ross,I dont want it pure white and Im just going to cut off a teeniest tiniest little roll of paint okay now then all you have to do just want to put the indication here and there of a a little water
Bob Ross,line actually all Im looking for here is a little light color between these darks just enough to set it apart there see how that makes it stand out fantastic if youre ever getting one lets say one
Bob Ross,here its too bright all you have to do is rub it itll pick up that dark color thats underneath and automatically itll go away now maybe I tell you what lets go back to our 2in brush tap in a
Bob Ross,little more color maybe maybe maybe in our world maybe our land comes right down here like so shoot lets get crazy lets bring it right on down just let your imagination go where do you want it there
Bob Ross,look how soft that is and a super place to just take your shoes off and sort of run barefooted H there we go little Indian yellow little yellow ochre here and there just to change the flavor some
Bob Ross,every once in a while the least little touch of the bright red least little touch dont want it to get bright red but when you mix that with the ochres and the yellows and the greens it makes a very
Bob Ross,nice little color there Music okay shoot we about got this rasco fixed I clean that edge up a little okay now then you know me shoot I like big trees so lets lets get crazy today Im going to take
Bob Ross,the small knife go right up here and Im going to get a big roll of Van Dyk Brown a lot of Van Dyk Brown on the knife and lets decide maybe maybe maybe maybe does now we have a big tree big strong
Bob Ross,tree and he lives right there right there now if youre in your painting if you dont want a big tree just leave him out I like it because it pushes everything in the painting back look at that though
Bob Ross,that easy that easy you can make a big old tree let just give him a big strong foot down here got to have something to stand on we dont even fall over in the lake and make a big splash there we go
Bob Ross,okay now then lets put some highlight on that we use some white little bright red in it like so okay cut off that small roll of paint and its right down on the edge of the knife and here all Im
Bob Ross,going to do is just touch the canvas all you have to do is touch itll pull off what it wants give you back whats left just want to put the indication here and theres some highlight on this trunk
Bob Ross,see but all youre doing is just touching the canvas you need to load the knife correctly that little roll of paint is so important itll make everything work nice there and just let it blend
Bob Ross,backwards getting darker and darker and darker as it comes back around this side darker darker darker so you can make the indication of a little hole in the tree down here just by leaving that very
Bob Ross,dark and working around it now on the other side you can take a little white at least little touch of press and blue and just put the indication here in there of a little bit of reflected light not
Bob Ross,too much just a little wipe off the knife now you take just a touch of Bandy Brown and sort of put in the center here and bring it all together thatll just bring those two colors together and it
Bob Ross,really makes it look like it looks like a real tree trunk it looks like real bark on there you can feel it when it gets dry now then Im going to take paint thinner paint thinner go right into my van
Bob Ross,Dy Brown I want this thin like ink again know you get tired of hear in that too but its important if you want this to flow maybe right here oh there he is big old tired limb lives and he just sort of
Bob Ross,hangs out around here this is where if you have a little nervous Twitch in your hand it really pays dividence cuz these old tree LMS look better if theyre theyre sort of crookedy there we go a
Bob Ross,little bit more of paint and however many limbs you want put them on maybe theres another one yep youre right lives right there right there but see how easy that is you can do it you can do it I get
Bob Ross,I get so many letters from people we like sometimes we put some of these letters in our newsletter and send them out and let you read those too but in these letters people are talking about how they
Bob Ross,never dreamed never dreamed that they could paint and they watch the show look through the books and Etc and theyre producing fantastic paintings little more of the color on here lets put some
Bob Ross,leaves on this tree all were going to do here is just tap think about some general shapes and just drop in some happy little things here and there wherever you want them there we are just drop a few
Bob Ross,little things in but isnt that fantastic that easy you can complete a scene in a half an hour or so or however long it takes it looks like youre deep deep in the woods and youre in there with all
Bob Ross,of Gods Little Creatures and its a super day and Ive enjoyed being with you and from all of us here Id like to wish you happy painting God bless I look forward to seeing you again Music Music
Bob Ross,hello welcome back Im certainly glad to see you today lets do a little painting today that I think youll really like and and let me tell you what Ive already got done up here Ive got a a black
Bob Ross,canvas as you can plainly see but the thing that you might not be able to see on your screen at home is theres a an oval cut out and put on here this oval is just contact paper and Ive stuck it on
Bob Ross,then Ive painted this black with black gesso allowed that to dry and then Ive covered the entire thing with a mixture of a lizard and crimson and phthalo blue and in the center here theres a little
Bob Ross,more Crimson than there is out here Ive let it get progressively darker toward this side so its brighter in the middle and it is out here so I tell you what lets have them run all the colors across
Bob Ross,the screen that you need to paint this fantastic little painting and well go on up here and get started Im going to start today with the old 2-in brush going to a small amount of the liquid white
Bob Ross,and Im going to go right up in here you have to make a decision right off in this painting wheres wheres your light area going to be I think itll will be right there now just take the liquid white
Bob Ross,and begin blending outward making little crisscross strokes but always blending outward once you start we want to keep this area in here the brightest but look how that shines son of a gun boy you put
Bob Ross,that liquid white on top of that transparent color it just comes alive there and we can do this as many times as we want to achieve a desired lightness okay but the only big secret be sure you wash
Bob Ross,your brush between each application shake it off thats really the fun part of this back to the brightest area little touch of the liquid white and off we go there isnt that fantastic that you can
Bob Ross,make a sky thats that pretty that easy have very lightly you can just sort of blend across it take the brush Strokes out and have a look see at what you have and if its not what you want this is the
Bob Ross,time to change it dont wait till your paintings halfway through and then go back and and say Hey I want to change this guy this is the time to play with it tell you what lets go into some lizard
Bob Ross,Crimson little lizard Crimson little phthalo blue same colors Im just going to just going to tap some into the large brush here there we go just tap load a little color Im going to use just the
Bob Ross,corner of this brush and lets go up in here and maybe in our world maybe theres some little bushes and trees that live in here there they are just some little indications that hang out over here
Bob Ross,there its a very soft little painting were going to do today Misty and quiet pretty little rascal okay maybe over here wherever you want them just just put in all kind of little things you have to
Bob Ross,make decisions where they live there I want to save that bright area and thats slightly off center so its not its not right in the center slightly off center theres another one see just drop them
Bob Ross,in wherever you think they should live now Im going to add add a little bit more blue so it gets a little bit darker as it gets away from this light area see little darker I hope you can see that
Bob Ross,its all kind of little things happening there looks like little tree branches hanging everywhere a little bit more to the bluish tone bluish H there okay while we have that dark color in the brush
Bob Ross,lets go over to the other side here and put a few little things in there these are just little background trees and bushes there we are now then tell you what we want to put the indication here and
Bob Ross,there of some little tree trunks and some stems and twigs so Im going to take Im going to take a little paint thinner on my liner brush and go right into that same exact color I want this color to
Bob Ross,be very thin water consistency just itll flow okay turn that brush and bring it to a nice sharp Point see how sharp it is its a script liner brush here has very long hair on it so itll hold a lot
Bob Ross,of paint now then I want to just here and there here and there put the indication of some little twigs and stems and all kind of things happening lets go right in here see them just sort of let your
Bob Ross,imagination be a guide here just drop them in wherever you want them maybe theres one in there he comes but these little details here really make your paintings stand out if youre in a group Selling
Bob Ross,paintings and you have all these little details guess whose paintings are going to sell and this painting is so simple this is one of the easiest paintings in this entire series even if youve never
Bob Ross,painted before this is one that youll have good results the first time you try it its very very easy and its fun and maybe the most important thing its a striking painting its really an effective
Bob Ross,little son of a gun Im I like this one there maybe over here theres a stick and a twig and wherever you just sort of have to make some decisions where you think they live and put them in look at
Bob Ross,that but look at that light glowing in there you can just see the the light just its just filtering through there Ive painted so many paintings and I still get excited when I see this work guess
Bob Ross,thats the kid in me it never gets old thats one thing is so fantastic about painting if you paint a million paintings in your life youre never going to be satisfied and the next ones going to be
Bob Ross,your Masterpiece and theres always something to learn every time you paint a picture you learn something that will help you when you do your next one okay lets go over to the other side of this and
Bob Ross,put a few into this side dont want him left out there big old strong one there and by making these on the side bigger stronger it gives you illusion that this is further away than here and it sort of
Bob Ross,wraps the painting around and its very pleasant to the eye there we go now then cleaned off my little brush and I just wash it in some paint thinner and wipe it on a paper towel I want to put the
Bob Ross,least little indication of a tiniest little bit of foliage but not much not much be right back grab a tiny little bit of blue and a little bit of titanium white this is uh phthalo blue lizard and
Bob Ross,crimson and the least little touch least little touch of titanium white okay now then here and there I just want to put the indication just barely so it just barely shows I dont want it I dont want
Bob Ross,it to be too bright CU this is too far away and I want to retain that Misty appearance now in your painting if you want it brighter just add a little bit more white and itll really stand out its
Bob Ross,very individual however you you want yours to be thats exactly the way it ought to be okay maybe maybe yep right there so we can see just a little indication of some nice little things that are
Bob Ross,happening back here on this tree but not much we dont want much okay lets go on the other side now in here few little things theres a few these are so subdued I hope they show up on your set there
Bob Ross,we go maybe yeah theres one just sort of pick them out all youre doing is just sort of looking around and deciding where they live dropping a few little things in heres one theres another little
Bob Ross,one maybe down here just a few happy little things growing around the bottom shoot we got it and thats really all there is to it okay lets have some fun here let me get there we go get old 2in brush
Bob Ross,here thats not dirty Im going to put some of that same lavender color into the bristles just taing a little bit in okay now Im going to come right down here and go right into the cad yellow little
Bob Ross,touch of yellow ochre just sort of mix them together on the brush little Indian yellow here and there the least little touch of the bright red and by mixing color on the brush you end up with a
Bob Ross,multitude of colors happening on the brush you dont have just one flat old dead color there all kinds of effects going on see tap give it a little push that loads the end of the bristles now then
Bob Ross,maybe in here theres some soft grassy areas all you have to do is it just begin touching just touch tap see there look at him go very gentle you can make this look absolutely like velvet there darker
Bob Ross,and darker and darker back in here cuz its going back into the to the shadow areas okay right on down here and you just sort of work in layers completing the most distant layer first and coming
Bob Ross,forward forward forward always working forward there now if you want to brighten an area maybe you want the light coming right through here and right in here I went into a small amount of just
Bob Ross,straight titanium white you see and all you have to do is just barely touch and thatll highlight right right where that light area is but dont overdo if you overdo itll kill the effectiveness of it
Bob Ross,see now that gives the impression that theres a light shining through there but if you do too much its just going to look too bright there tell you what lets do maybe theres some rocks and stones
Bob Ross,that live out here take some Van Dyk Brown pull it out very flat flat as you can get it go straight down with a knife cut across and get our little roll of paint there it is can scope here now maybe
Bob Ross,maybe right in here somewhere look at there just touch give it a little sidewards pull were just going to put the indication up just a few little rocks and stones and some dirt showing here and there
Bob Ross,there we go wherever you want them now then now then titanium white little dark Sienna mix them together so theyre marbley I dont know if thats a correct word or not not but you know what I mean
Bob Ross,its not over mixed theres all kind of streaks going through it cuz those streaks are still on the knife see okay now then you can take that and just let it sort of Bounce along barely touching graze
Bob Ross,it caress it there softly very softly see but it its just like when you put snow on the mountain you need it to break and it leaves some holes and stuff in there so the Dark shows through and it
Bob Ross,looks like dirt and rocks and stones and shoot you can even put a big Stone right there wherever you want him see put some dark underneath him stand him right up there I know thats hard to see when
Bob Ross,we get the the little grassy areas around though then itll stand out then itll stand out a little more of the color on my 2-in brush okay lets go back up here now come right down in front of that
Bob Ross,and thatll push that dirt right down into the painting there we go that easy I like little paintings like this now this one as I mentioned earlier has an oval on it if you want to do this painting
Bob Ross,without the oval all you do is leave it off paint the whole canvas with black gesso and take off this makes a beautiful fullsize painting just because I have the oval on here certainly doesnt mean
Bob Ross,that you have to there we go see and youre just working down down down in layers always in layers now then lets have some fun let me find the fan brush here maybe theres some trees that live in
Bob Ross,there lets go right into midnight black load a lot of paint on the brush a lot of paint a lot of paint both sides full see there okay lets go up here maybe there lives in our world right here a nice
Bob Ross,tree comes down to about like that okay make him just a little thicker we make him a little stronger a little bigger now he has a friend lives right there that trees name is Bill see it pays to give
Bob Ross,them names there make friends with them what the heck maybe maybe maybe there we are theres one right there see we just let them grow right off the same spot now then take my liner brush paint
Bob Ross,thinner on it once again we want this paint to be very thin very thin so itll flow lets go right up here now then lets decide where some limbs live on this tree maybe theres one right out through
Bob Ross,there see but the paint should be so thin that it just flows right off your brush maybe yeah theres one up here there we go think of just how lims would grow on this old tree this is your tree so you
Bob Ross,decide wherever you want them however you want them thats the right way there maybe this one comes right on back across we dont know limbs go all kinds of ways there one up in there okay one over
Bob Ross,here I recently was doing a show for one of the PBS stations and we did a painting like this only big great big then we auctioned it off for the PBS station to make a happy Buck oh people really like
Bob Ross,this one when they could see it up close its beautiful beautiful painting and we travel all over the country doing shows for PBS stations and and charity groups so if we get to your we get to your
Bob Ross,town i sure left to have the opportunity to meet you and talk with you so come by and see us and if you want to know when were going to be in your area just drop me a card with your name and address
Bob Ross,on it and Ill put it with our mailing list and when we get to your area Ill let you know well drop you a little card there and you can just send it to the address thats on the end of the show they
Bob Ross,send everything to me here Im just adding some more little grassy areas in there we go but just layer after layer after layer see maybe you want to strengthen this a little bit I want to make that a
Bob Ross,little more distinct right in there go back some dark color dark color makes that light just jump right out at you okay little bit of grass right in here sh we just bring us right on down at that
Bob Ross,fantastic and as I say if youve never never painted with me before this is an excellent painting for your first project its so nice and it works well it works so well there now the more you tap on
Bob Ross,this little grassy area here the softer itll become um it will absolutely get to where it looks just like a velvet and thats very nice okay let me find a 1-in brush here well just use the same old
Bob Ross,one we were using go right into some blue some blue and some alarin crimson and well just mix these on the brush okay I want some very dark colors here this should look black should look black Ill
Bob Ross,be right back I want to get a least little touch of paint thinner Im want to thin it just a tiny bit cuz Im going to apply this overcolor thats already on the canvas so one of our golden rules is a
Bob Ross,thin paint will stick to a thick paint so if you start with a very thick base color then you can put lighter colors over the top of it thinner colors now I want to put the indication of some
Bob Ross,silhouetted leaves in here so all were going to do just use the corner of the brush oh Im killing all my beautiful little tree limbs but thats all right we know this there sometimes that helps give
Bob Ross,you an idea of where to put these if you have limbs on your trees there maybe that comes right up into here we dont know wherever you want them these are just little loose leaves they just sort of
Bob Ross,play around all day they have fun there we go good and dark now while I have that color maybe theres some bushes that live right here well just push in a little bit of color we need that dark so our
Bob Ross,light will show well have a little Bush or two that lives there there he is now grab another brush and Im going to dip this into a least little touch of liquid white and then go back into my yellows
Bob Ross,grab some sap green load the brush full of color full of color pull the brush in One Direction One Direction see that loads a lot of paint right out on the end of the bristles One Direction though
Bob Ross,okay now if you have a lot of paint loaded into this brush it takes very little pressure when you touch up here if you dont have enough paint you have to hit hard and it sort of smushes you know gets
Bob Ross,all itll get all muddy on you but with a lot of paint all you have to do is use a very gentle touch and just give it a little push just enough to barely barely bend the bristles okay reload the brush
Bob Ross,put another little bush in look at there and put in a little layers leaving some dark areas in between its most important that you leave those little dark areas maybe back in here it iss a happy
Bob Ross,little Bush or two about like so about like so just wherever you want them and we can have some of these just come right down from their foots there now with a clean knife we can scrape through and
Bob Ross,allow some of that black to show through and it looks like little sticks and twigs hope you can see those they are here if you cant see them theyre here it looks like all kind of little sticks that
Bob Ross,are holding up your bushes and see just wherever put one right over there you can see it over the top of that light color really add some detail to your painting okay tell you what on this particular
Bob Ross,I want to bring show you how to bring this tree forward watch here all you got to do just take a little color like so and you can pull that rasco right on up into the foreground that easy and once
Bob Ross,again that helps create the illusion of depth you can see grass between this tree and this tree and now theres distance between them just one of those little things thatll make your painting look a
Bob Ross,little special little limb right there okay and then Im going to take this is some dark Sienna and white get the least little touch of bright red least little touch pull it out very flat get a very
Bob Ross,small roll of paint on the knife tiny little roll now if our lights coming from there maybe theres a little light that just bounces right through here well put some on and Ill show you how to mute
Bob Ross,it calm it down little light hitting right on those tree trunks now we clean the knife and just begin touching tapping is just a clean knife so the color mixes together and thatll subdue it make it
Bob Ross,quieter but itll still leave a little Sparkle out here right on the edge of these trees or maybe a little lights just shining through okay lets do this one there see that tree little bit right here
Bob Ross,wherever you think light would hit okay shoot speaking of trees lets have some fun lets have some fun Ill just use the old big knife big knife or small knife pull out bandake brown get a roll of
Bob Ross,paint now maybe theres a big tree lives right over in here I like these old big trees in my painting but if you dont want it in yours leave it off watch here though watch here watch here excuse my
Bob Ross,arm for just a second maybe this limb comes down there he comes this is your bravery test this is your bravery test okay maybe yep youre youre right there another big limb right there theres a lot
Bob Ross,of paint here lot of paint on when this one dries itll feel like real bark maybe theres another limb comes off in this direction there okay need a big old big old root holds up this monster tree
Bob Ross,other one there now then I tell you what we have this color it was oh white little bit of dark Sienna little bright red pull it out very flat get our roll of paint pull it out roll of paint that easy
Bob Ross,okay now then very gently very gently just let this touch graze and just slide right down the tree youre just barely barely touching no pressure just like putting snow on the mountain only on a tree
Bob Ross,see put no pressure over here a little bit right there where the lights coming through there now the other side well take a little blue Pho blue blue a little white and lets just put the indication
Bob Ross,here of a little reflected light here and there there just Sparkles it up gives a a cool color a little bit more of a brown can lay that in here and sort of bring all that together just let it work
Bob Ross,right around like Music so and you could take a little brown on the liner brush and put the indication here and there of a few limbs in my world I think this old tree is its dead but theres still
Bob Ross,a limb here and there hanging not many okay tell you what Lets do lets have the camera come right up here and Im going to take the contact paper off and lets you take a look see isnt that
Bob Ross,fantastic to me these are some of the most beautiful little paintings and I think with that Ill sign this one take a little bit of bright red go right up here certainly hope youve enjoyed it as Ive
Bob Ross,mentioned several times this is a very nice painting if this is your first attempt so give it a try and from all of us here happy painting and God Music bless Music Music go
Bob Ross,hi welcome back im glad you could join me today tell you what lets start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need at home to paint along with me while theyre doing
Bob Ross,that let me tell you what ive done already ive got my canvas up here got it covered with a thin even coat of the liquid white its all wet and its its ready to go so lets go i thought today we
Bob Ross,just do a beautiful little maybe just a little bright painting that youll really like this is the last show of the 14th series theres 13 shows in each series so we have a bunch of shows now i hope
Bob Ross,youve got to see all of them tell you what lets start today with a small amount of the phthalo blue and well just use the old two inch brush what the heck just tap a little color right into the
Bob Ross,bristles it takes very little color and lets go up in here and well start or just make little crisscross strokes like so and we just very quickly just just drop in a happy little sky here there we
Bob Ross,go okay the color is continually continually mixing with the liquid white and it gets lighter and lighter as it works down toward the horizon lighter and lighter and in a landscape that helps create
Bob Ross,the illusion of distance everything should get lighter toward the horizon okay and that easy weve got some color in the sky i think in this painting well put a little bit of water what the heck so
Bob Ross,while i have this whole brush going ill go right back into the phthalo blue ill reach over here be right back get a little touch of the black i want to darken this a little bit so we have phthalo
Bob Ross,blue and a touch of black maybe well have water down on this side wherever we can certainly change our mind later if we want to there okay im pulling from the outside in and im leaving a little
Bob Ross,area open right here thatll be our light shining across the water when were done okay then very lightly just go across the entire bottom here that easy okay blend this out a little and today i think
Bob Ross,well put a happy little cloud up in the sky wash our brush we we wash our brushes as you know with odorless thinner shake off the excess and just beat the devil out of it okay lets use lets use the
Bob Ross,old fan brush today and you could put these clouds up here with a one inch brush two inch brush just just about any old thing just use a fan brush today what the heck all right maybe maybe theres a
Bob Ross,little cloud that lives right there comes around i dont know however you want him to be just sort of make a decision and drop him in clouds are very free they just sort of float around the sky and
Bob Ross,have fun all day okay maybe tell you what maybe right here another little cloud maybe this maybe this is the same cloud what tag see just just throw it in wherever you want it thats the beauty of
Bob Ross,this style of painting we dont we dont draw any pictures on the canvas we dont do any tracings theres no fill in the blocks we just sort of do it and to me thats thats fun thats freedom years
Bob Ross,ago i used to sit and id draw a picture on the canvas and then spend days and days trying to fill in the blocks without getting out of lines it sort of reminded me of a little coloring book i had
Bob Ross,when i was a kid i was so happy when i found this because here you just do whatever makes you happy just let it go now then large brush using just the corner just the corner im going to blend those
Bob Ross,clouds out a little bit just blend them a little there knock off the excess paint now very lightly using circular strokes im going to fluff these little clouds just fluff them there maybe ill fluff
Bob Ross,this one this way however there very lightly three hairs in some air just blend it a little bit just blend it there we go okay maybe maybe in our world maybe theres another little cloud thats right
Bob Ross,here just sort of wherever you want them i thought wed put several little layers of clouds here today and thatll give you some practice doing clouds because theres so much fun to do there we go
Bob Ross,just sort of scrub that in there theres some little stringy ones that live down here maybe right there theres a happy little clown a little bump on him give him some character shoot that little
Bob Ross,rascal have some fun out here in the sun maybe maybe he may be right there he goes but just let your imagination go let it go and when you get very free with your painting that really is when you
Bob Ross,experience the joy of painting get a little plug in there there okay and well lift it fluff it there we go and very lightly once again just blend it see the layers of clouds that youve created that
Bob Ross,easy a little bit of blending here give it a little lift upward when i beat this brush all im doing is knocking the excess paint off the bristles so i dont have to clean the the brush again when you
Bob Ross,blend these clouds you pick up a little bit of the sky coloring a little bit of the cloud color so if you just wrap it real hard just really slap it against something solid and it takes that out okay
Bob Ross,i think were in business lets build today maybe back in here lets do a little mountain for that im going to use some vending brown a little touch of depression blue brown a little bit of blue
Bob Ross,mostly brown dont put a little black in there too just make sure its good and dark what the heck okay pull that paint out as flat as we can get it go straight down and cut across let me get that
Bob Ross,little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife now maybe back here today lets do just a little ridge of mountains that live back here firmly push that into the canvas youre really trying to
Bob Ross,push this color right into the fabric get tough with it show it whos boss there just sort of push very firmly we just let it go wherever okay now then ill take a two inch brush and i want to pull
Bob Ross,this paint because this is wet you can move the color on the canvas if you tried this on a dry canvas youd be upset with me but on a wet canvas then you can move it and on a good canvas liquid white
Bob Ross,should stay wet for a day or two shoot it doesnt dry very fast at all its an oil based paint and itll stay wet there now the one thing i get a lot of letters people saying can i use canvas boards
Bob Ross,canvas boards have cardboard in the center and they have a tendency to absorb your liquid white and it leaves you with a dry surface and we are dependent upon the wet surface lets wash your brush so
Bob Ross,i really recommend you use it use a pre-stretched double prime canvas two coats of primer on it and that way itll assure you that your liquid white will stay wet through your entire painting okay
Bob Ross,little dark sienna a little white maybe at least a little touch of van dyke brown there too just to streak it up some pull it out flat and once again our little roll of paint and all those little
Bob Ross,colors are in that roll of paint also now we can go up here no pressure no pressure at all so you get all those little variations of color though because you didnt over mix your paint on the palette
Bob Ross,if you over mix it on the palette then you get one dead old dull color and were looking for some life and some action in this we want the son of a gun to stand out and shine in the sun there see no
Bob Ross,pressure though okay for shadow color ill make some blue and some white some van dyke brown there we go just blue brown and white and make us a good shadow color put a little black in there too
Bob Ross,thatll gray it oh thats nice thats nice okay once again that small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife now then you have to sort of make a determination where your lights coming from and
Bob Ross,in my world today its coming from the right side get the little knife that little knife just sneaks right in there and does such nice things okay go right up in here so we can just begin putting in
Bob Ross,all kinds of little things see that little knife gets in there where the big knife might be hitting other things that you dont want it to hit just here and there put in a few little shadows and sort
Bob Ross,of let them blend together and work that a little bit there we go its very subdued very quiet put little bumps here and there a little shadow behind that bump there but youre limited only by your
Bob Ross,imagination only by your imagination in painting you can go to any world that you want and i think thats probably what attracts a lot of people including me i like to be able to create my own world
Bob Ross,and im very happy that you joined me in that world that you youve invited me back into your home for this series thats very special the fact that you bother to call your stations and and tell them
Bob Ross,that you enjoy the show or you write them support them thats what thats what allows us to come back for another series so thank you very much for taking the time to do that its its very special
Bob Ross,im going to take just a two inch brush i want to create a misty effect down here at the base of this mountain so tap just lightly following the angles and then very light oh just barely barely
Bob Ross,grazing the canvas oh just barely touch it barely touch it make love to it gently very gently caress it see there very soft though okay lets have some fun lets take well well just use whatever we
Bob Ross,had there that was our mountain color well add a little sap green to it throw in some light color i want this to begin having a greenish tone to it not a great deal of green yet but a little maybe
Bob Ross,throw a little more phthalo blue in there a little white all right nice okay let me clean my knife off grab another fan brush i have several of those going just load a little color into it lets go
Bob Ross,right up here and maybe yeah lets have it right here maybe right in here theres some little footy hills that live some little foothills far away and all im doing is striking and pushing downward
Bob Ross,see there it makes it look like just hundreds and hundreds of little individual trees that are far away a little more paint there we go maybe it goes right on up like that okay now i want the illusion
Bob Ross,of mist at the base of these trees so im going to take the two inch brush and tap firmly right at the base of these trees this is really where you take out all your frustrations see here look how
Bob Ross,soft that becomes there very lightly very lightly just lift upward and that creates a beautiful illusion of mist in there lets take the same color here well add some black to it a little bit of
Bob Ross,prussian blue but its basically the same color only darker i want it darker as things get closer to you in the landscape remember that they get darker okay now then maybe theres another range of
Bob Ross,foothills and maybe they live right here say tap downward though and you have to decide where they live maybe they go clean them up like that on over there somewhere we dont know we dont know at
Bob Ross,this point we really dont care it doesnt matter does not matter well make those big decisions later there okay tap that right in maybe this goes up on this side whatever whatever now then back to
Bob Ross,our large brush once again i want to create this little misty effect in between here so to do that take this big brush use the top corner and firmly firmly tap the base of that see there that tapping
Bob Ross,creates a beautiful beautiful misty effect thats mixing with the liquid white thats on the canvas and that happens automatically you dont have to worry about it think about it just tap and it
Bob Ross,happens now very lightly lift upward it pushes all that back look there now what separates these two rows of foothills is that little misty area thats in between that and the difference in color but
Bob Ross,that little misty area is your good friend its so important so so important im going to ill take a little bit of blue phthalo blue little alizarin crimson mix it together like so proportionately
Bob Ross,more crimson than blue now maybe just take a little roll of paint there we go i have a small knife going maybe right up in here theres a little another little hill this is an excellent study in
Bob Ross,plains different areas it helps show how important all these different areas are to create that illusion of depth and distance in your painting i bet youve seen paintings that are very flat and
Bob Ross,theyre not they just dont look right to you there we go you know another question that that i get repeatedly is can i do this style of painting with acrylics well it really does not work very well
Bob Ross,because the acrylics dry so fast it leaves you with a dry surface and as i mentioned earlier for this to work effectively you really need a wet surface just does not work and i like oils because oils
Bob Ross,are so forgiving theyre so forgiving you dont make mistakes if you do something wrong you scrape it off and you do it again thats about the only medium you can do that with its like when i was in
Bob Ross,college i took a class in watercolor he taught me two things first of all it wasnt my medium secondly a great respect for those who could do it because you get one chance son of a gun well i messed
Bob Ross,that up and it was over ill take your two inch brush two inch brush go right into that and well go right into that little lavender color we made okay now then im gonna start putting some little
Bob Ross,grassy areas right into there now see that little a little bit of mist right there that separates so important thats your separator okay lets come right on down maybe we just throw in some color
Bob Ross,right now there maybe like yeah anything we dont like well turn it into a reflection if we have water in here and we said weve got to have some water so well do that there we are just tap it in
Bob Ross,you could really put this in with a paint roller reflections grab it pull straight down there it comes there they are well say theyre right there come lightly across and we have instant reflections
Bob Ross,instant reflections maybe that land area comes right out through there just like so this is just a dark color so when we put highlights on it itll stand out ill tell you what im going to add a
Bob Ross,little black to my lavender lets just use this old brush what the heck maybe theres some happy little trees that live right in here you can use just the top corner of this brush and create the
Bob Ross,illusion have all kinds of beautiful little tree shapes see there just just turn the brush just use the top corner paint all kinds of beautiful little things there get a little touch more color maybe
Bob Ross,theres another one lives right here but you can just put as many or as few as you want in your world then come right up over the mountain so we can see it better lets see all were using is just the
Bob Ross,top corner of the brush i think thats another thing that attracted me to this technique is the fact that you dont need many specialized pieces of equipment i used to spend hundreds and hundreds of
Bob Ross,dollars on brushes this is a very economical way to paint and to learn and it gets a lot of people so excited but then they go into to more traditional art forms i get letters every day from people
Bob Ross,who tell me theyve now enrolled in their local college and university so they can increase their art knowledge but this is a beautiful way to get started and as we tell people when we go out and
Bob Ross,demonstrate this is a way to get you hooked because youll get hooked on this addicting and we dont make any bones about it so much fun that you will get addicted to it if youre like most of us okay
Bob Ross,take a lighter brush line a brush put some paint thinner on it a little bit a little bit of brown okay now lets go right up in here and well put an indication or two here and there a little tree
Bob Ross,trunk just here and there wherever wherever maybe over here we dont want this side left though okay whos going to use that same old brush its working so well im going to tap that corner into a
Bob Ross,little bit of yellow ochre a little bit of cad yellow just tap the corner i want very little paint just want to give the least little indication that theres some things happening up here in the top
Bob Ross,of these little trees that we made i dont want too much just a tiny little bit there but even now even though youre using this brush and one rather than what we normally use you still need to think
Bob Ross,about form and shape these trees dont just grow at random okay right here form and shape are so important anytime youre doing bushes and trees and all those things see there a little bit here see
Bob Ross,just a touch very very soft okay we take that same old brush and ill tap it into some color just tap it right in there now then lets go right back here look at there see now we can begin applying
Bob Ross,color right on top of that dark there we go just the different yellows and because i had a dirty brush green is going to occur automatically look at that layer after layer and if any of it gets in
Bob Ross,your water all you do is pull it straight down go across it becomes part of the reflection watch here watch here tell you what lets take some blue and some black a little sap green put it together
Bob Ross,take my old fan brush load it full of color maybe in our world here lets get crazy right here lives a nice evergreen tree i want a very dark area against this light mountain and watch what happens
Bob Ross,that contrast oh itll snap your eye right there leave the outside edges very soft and subdued like that lets put lets put another little one a little friend right there there we go see there okay
Bob Ross,we can take our knife just cut through here and there get the indication of some trunks your little sticks little bit of green a little bit of green a few highlights on there just a few once again i
Bob Ross,want to retain that darkness i want to keep that a little more of the yellows on the big brush and lets go in here and we have to make some big decisions here just begin bringing all this together i
Bob Ross,wanted to get darker darker darker out here toward the edges softer and softer there it is just follow that right on down darker darker darker out here and all were doing is tapping just tapping in
Bob Ross,just a few minutes well conclude this show and itll be the end of the 14th series and id like to thank you as i mentioned earlier for allowing me to come back and paint with you this is probably
Bob Ross,the most exciting thing in my entire life the fact that i have the opportunity to meet so many fantastic people and paint along with them each week lets take a little brown here maybe in our world we
Bob Ross,have a little tool tree thats right there right there soon we give him a friend put a little touch of white well make him a little birch tree not much just a little like so a little paint thinner we
Bob Ross,need a few little sticks and arms and things like that on him there the old clock on the wall tells me its about time for me to go i look forward to seeing you again weve already started production
