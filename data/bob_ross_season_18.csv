Bob Ross,"And if this is your first time with us, allow me to extend a personal invitation for you to drag out your big brushes and a few colors and paint along with us each week as we put some of natures"
Bob Ross,"masterpieces on canvas. Tell you what, Im gonna start out today and have em run all the color across the screen that you need to paint along with me"
Bob Ross,"And while theyre doing that, let me tell you what Ive already done up here"
Bob Ross,"Today I have my standard old 18 by 24 inch double-primed canvas, and onto that, Ive taken a piece of contact paper and sort of cut like a half an oval shape, and I just stuck it on"
Bob Ross,"And weve covered the entire canvas with a thin, even coat of liquid white"
Bob Ross,"This is a wet-on-wet painting technique, so then what normally the first thing that well do is we cover the canvas with something to make it wet and slick"
Bob Ross,"Today weve used liquid white, and all that does is allow us to actually blend color right on the canvas rather than working ourselves to death on the palette"
Bob Ross,"Today lets start off with the old two-inch brush, and lets go right up here and get this least little amount of phthalo blue, its a very strong color, you need very little, just pull it out, and"
Bob Ross,"then tap the bristles into the color. That assures that we get a nice, even distribution of color all the way through the bristles. And thats exactly what were looking for"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go right up here. Thought today wed do just a happy little scene. I wanna show you a very simple little scene that you can do even if youve never painted before"
Bob Ross,"This is a very easy, very nice little scene, and I think youll find it very enjoyable and rewarding. There we go, all were doing here is just using little crisscross strokes, little xs"
Bob Ross,"Thats really all it amounts to, little tiny xs. And the color, the blue color, is always blending with the liquid white thats on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"And automatically, automatically the sky gets lighter and lighter toward the horizon. And thats what were looking for in a landscape. We just blend it together here a little"
Bob Ross,"Okay, then very lightly we can just go across. All this does is just removes all the brush strokes and sorta pulls everything together just like so. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well have a little bit of water in this painting. If youve painted with me before, you know Im an absolute nut for water"
Bob Ross,"I think its so beautiful, and in this technique, its one of the nicest, easiest things to paint. So youll find water very enjoyable to do"
Bob Ross,"So well just take a small amount of that phthalo blue again back on the same old brush. Lets go right up here, and you have to make a decision here, where does your water live. Maybe"
Bob Ross,"maybe its right in here, just take and pull from the outside in. Thats all there is to it. Very lightly. Now then, well take it up to, oh, about there"
Bob Ross,"Doesnt matter, doesnt matter, wherever you want it. On this piece of canvas, you have absolute and total power. You can do anything that you wanna do here. You have unbelievable power"
Bob Ross,"You can move mighty rivers, push trees around, and mountains. Anything that you want to do on this piece of canvas. There, okay, and thatll end up being our water. Lets wash our old brush"
Bob Ross,"We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Let me say that again, odorless thinner"
Bob Ross,"If you dont use odorless thinner, youre gonna find yourself, banging chuckling youre gonna find yourself working alone very, very quickly. Really recommend you use odorless thinner"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets take a fan brush today, and lets build us a happy little cloud. And for that, well go right into titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Be right back, gonna get the least little touch of the bright red, least, least little touch, though. It goes a long way. Load a lot of color into the bristles. See, both sides are full of color"
Bob Ross,"Very good, now then, we have to make some big decision"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres some happy little clouds that live in our world, so take the corner of the brush and very gently begin making all these tiny little circles. Tiny little circles, add a little more paint"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And just begin forming your basic cloud shapes. Thats all were looking for at this point are very basic little shapes. Its all were looking for. Okay, just apply a little color"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Im gonna take a two-inch brush thats nice and clean and dry, and I have several of each brush going here. And very gently, very gently, just blend the base of this mountain, or cloud"
Bob Ross,"Son of a gun, I done called this a mountain. There we are, now, very lightly, lift upward. See, that just sort of fluffs it"
Bob Ross,"Then gently, gently, two hairs and some air, just blend it a little bit, and we have a cloud. Now when youre painting clouds, work in layers doing the cloud that you thinks the farthest away first"
Bob Ross,"And then well come back and reload the brush, and we can go back in here and make another one. Now sometimes we use a very firm paint. Sometimes youll find the paint maybe is a little too thick"
Bob Ross,"If that ever happens, add the least little touch of liquid white along with the titanium white. Least little amount because when you add liquid white here, your blending ability drops drastically"
Bob Ross,So dont add any more than you have to to get the paint to come off your brush onto the canvas. And we can put another happy little cloud that lives right here
Bob Ross,"And in your world, you have to make these decisions. You have to decide how many clouds live in your painting. There, see, I think theres one lives right there"
Bob Ross,"Right there, maybe up in here theres a little stringy one. It just sorta floats along, he just lays up here and has a good time, watches everything happen"
Bob Ross,"Now then, back to our clean, dry two-inch brush, and be sure its dry. It really needs to be dry. Blend the base of it, fluff it just like we did before"
Bob Ross,"And that easy, you have another happy little cloud. And you can put as many or as few as you want in your world. Maybe well do one more, its good practice"
Bob Ross,"Good practice, and the more you practice, the better you get, no matter what youre doing, whether its painting or anything else"
Bob Ross,"But if theres a secret to this or any other style of painting, its simply practice. There we go, now very gently, once again, we just wanna blend the base of this, just the base"
Bob Ross,"Lift it, fluff it, there. Very lightly, very lightly, just go across. And so now see, we have all these layers of clouds now"
Bob Ross,"And you can come along in here and, you know, maybe once again, maybe you wanna put some little stringy clouds in here, little floaters"
Bob Ross,"And those are very easy, all you have to do is just sorta lay em in. Blend em the least little amount. And then very lightly just go over em. Isnt that something"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe well have a little mountain that lives way, way back in the distance here. Very simple little mountain, one thats very quiet, very subdued"
Bob Ross,"Well take some black, a little van dyke brown, little touch of alizarin crimson in there. Like so. Maybe the least little touch of prussian blue, there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then pull the paint out as flat as you can get it. Really get tough with it"
Bob Ross,"Go down with the knife, touch, and just cut across, that way you get a small roll of paint, lives right on the edge of the knife. Okay, lets go up here. Now then, we have to make a big decision"
Bob Ross,"Where does our little mountain live. And we want this to be a far away, very distant little mountain. So we dont want it to get too big on us. These rascals will grow on you very quickly"
Bob Ross,"Theyll take over your whole world. And you have to make some decisions, where you want little bumps, little tops. All you have to do is just put em on just like so"
Bob Ross,Now the only thing that were worried about at this point is a nice top edge up here. We could care less whats happening in here. Doesnt make any difference to us at this point
Bob Ross,"Now then, once again, take a two-inch brush, grab this, and pull it. Because the liquid whites on the canvas, you can move this color. Its wet, and itll slip and slide"
Bob Ross,"Now then, just by using brush strokes, if you wanna make a little mountain thats far away, just by using the little brush strokes here, you can make the indication of highlights and shadows, all"
Bob Ross,"If you cant, when youre painting, I guarantee, youll understand what Im saying there because theyll show up, itll look like all kinds of beautiful little things that are just happening out there"
Bob Ross,"automatically, and you dont have to work at all. And this is a lazy mans way of painting"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, Ill tell you what, lets take some white, little bit of phthalo blue, a little of that mountain color just to gray it down some"
Bob Ross,"There, maybe in our world, way back in the distance there, there lives a little foothill. Now push, see, hit it and give it a little push"
Bob Ross,"Make it slide a little, that loads paint right out at the end of the bristles. Lets go ahead up here. Okay, now we have a little foothill, maybe it lives, yep, youre right, youre right, there it is"
Bob Ross,"Little foothill lives right out there, see. Well just let it disappear into nothing. Very soft, quiet, gentle little thing"
Bob Ross,"It lives down here at the base of this big mountain, and he just watches everything that goes on. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then, while we have that color on the brush, maybe we wanna make the indication of a little reflection down here"
Bob Ross,"To do that, just pull straight down with a little bit of the color, but straight down, thats important. And gently across. Now thatll give us an indication of a little reflection"
Bob Ross,"Other thing we can do, lift upward, very short little strokes. Thatll make it look like little distant trees that live way back there, far, far away. Very subdued, though"
Bob Ross,"All right, now one thing that gives a painting a lot of depth and distance is different planes or layers in it. So lets make several different layers in here"
Bob Ross,Well just use that old mountain color here
Bob Ross,"I think that was just black, a little prussian blue, little van dyke brown, alizarin crimson, and to that, Im gonna add the least little touch of sap green. Not much, just a little"
Bob Ross,"Once again, tap the brush just to load it. Now then. Lets begin putting in all different layers or planes. Maybe theres one that lives right here, and it comes right down like that"
Bob Ross,Let your imagination go and decide where you want all these little things to live
Bob Ross,"There, okay, now then, each time you put one of these little peninsulas out here though, we need a reflection under it, its very important. Pull straight down, go gently across"
Bob Ross,And then you can make a decision where the next one lives. Maybe the next one is right here
Bob Ross,"Now see, you may, its almost a natural tendency to want to put all of these in and then put the reflections, but when you pull these down, it would destroy the top of that one"
Bob Ross,"Hope all that makes sense, so do em one at a time. Dont be in too big a hurry. Speed will come automatically with practice. There. Right now, were just trying to learn the basic technique"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, shoot, maybe theres another one right here. I dont know. Just let it go, thats the beauty of this, you really dont have to set and plan every little detail out"
Bob Ross,"Have a general idea in your mind of where you wanna go with this painting and what you want it to look like. So basically, all you have to do is figure out the time of year and the time of day"
Bob Ross,"And other than that, youre free. You can do anything here that you want. Lets take a little cad yellow, be right back, grab a little of the sap green"
Bob Ross,"Well just use a fan brush today, doesnt matter. Little touch of yellow ochre. There, maybe a little more of the green here. There, thats a beautiful green"
Bob Ross,"But by mixing color on the fan brush like this, you have a multitude of color happening in the bristles. Look at all the different values and colors"
Bob Ross,"My gosh, youd work forever to do that if you were trying to mix each one of those separate colors. This way, it happens automatically"
Bob Ross,"Then we can go back up in here and we can just begin pushing in some highlights. We need that dark underneath, though, so this nice green color will show. There. You know what"
Bob Ross,"Let me grab another fan brush. I see something here Id like to do. Lets take another fan brush. Well go right into some black, brown, same old colors again. Crimson, sap green"
Bob Ross,"Little bit of the prussian blue. Very dark color. In my mind, see how you can change your mind. I see little trees, maybe theres little evergreens that live way back here"
Bob Ross,"Just take the top corner of this fan brush, and well put in the indication of little trees that are far away, we dont want too much detail there"
Bob Ross,"If you put too much detail in trees this far away, youll lose that illusion of distance. So just a little, there. There we go, let em just come right on down and disappear into nothing. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now then. Back to our fan brush. And we can put in all those beautiful little green areas. There we are, isnt that fantastic. Now work in layers, though, watch here, watch here"
Bob Ross,"See, here comes another one out here on this little peninsula that sticks out into the water. That easy. That easy, and you can just put layer after layer after layer"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take a little touch of the liquid white. A little liquid white. Ill put the least little touch of the bright red into the color"
Bob Ross,"Now even though this water line is dropping down, down, down, you want to keep these lines basically straight, otherwise itll look like, itll look like the waters gonna run right out of your"
Bob Ross,"painting and get your floor all wet. So you can go anywhere you wanna go with these, but try to keep em as straight as possible. There"
Bob Ross,"And maybe here and there, maybe you want to put the indication of a little ripple here and there. Those too need to be as straight as possible. Try to keep those straight"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets get crazy. Well go right back to the old fan brush that I had that had the black and the prussian blue and the brown and green, crimson. Load a lot of color into the bristles"
Bob Ross,"And maybe in our world there lives. Maybe theres a nice evergreen tree that lives right here, just touch. Give yourself sort of a little center line"
Bob Ross,"Now were gonna use just the corner of the brush, just the corner. See there, and these little evergreens live right here in these fan brushes. All you have to do is sorta scare em out"
Bob Ross,"And as you work down the tree, add more and more pressure. Were still using the corner of the brush, but were just pushing harder and harder"
Bob Ross,"And automatically your tree will get larger and larger as it works downward, and normally, trees look better if thats the case"
Bob Ross,"There we go, now then, you know me, I think everybody should have a friend. So lets go right here and give this little tree a friend"
Bob Ross,"Same thing, see just use a corner of the brush and work back and forth. Like so. There. And that easy, we got a couple of beautiful little evergreen trees"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can take the knife, take a little titanium white, little dark sienna, mix it together. Pull it out very flat, and we cut across. Once again, we get our little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"Normally, normally, we always load the knife with that little roll of paint, so spend a little time practicing so you can do that without even thinking about it. Okay, little bit right there"
Bob Ross,"There we go, and that just gives the indication of some little tree trunks on our trees. We dont want em to be weak and fall over and drop into the water"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit of black, a little yellow, and make a very dark green. Well put that on the fan brush. A lot of color, just load both sides full of color. Lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, in my world, maybe the lights coming from the right, so we wanna put more emphasis on the right side of the tree than we do on the left"
Bob Ross,"There we go, and well put some highlights on this tree. But evergreen trees are normally quite dark, so dont let em get too bright on you cause them rascals will"
Bob Ross,"It get to be fun, and next thing you know, youve covered up all your dark areas. And you need that contrast to make your tree beautiful, make it stand out"
Bob Ross,"There, darker, darker, darker down here toward the base cause trees are darker, theres more shadows down here. All right, shoot, lets get crazy, get the big brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets go right into that dark color. Same old thing, black, blue, van dyke, a little crimson, a little sap green. Well use the old two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Pull it in one direction here, load a lot of color into it. There we go, lets go right up here. Now then, lets just put something right here, watch here"
Bob Ross,"Lets just begin, and you have to make some decisions here. Where do you want all these little bushes and stuff to live. Here they are, wherever you want em, thats exactly where they oughta be"
Bob Ross,"And well just let em sort of fade out down here. But that easy, that easy. When you use this big old brush, you can cover a lot of space quickly. There, and this is a two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"There, okay, and all were doing, once again, is just laying in some dark color so when we apply our highlights or our light colors, that theyll stand out and show"
Bob Ross,"Its really the only reason we put this in here. Now then, another thing you can do, you can take just a clean knife and sneak up in here and just scrape in all kinds of little sticks and twig areas"
Bob Ross,"Now when this is done, itll look like you spent days and days with your little one-haired brush just going in here and drawing all these"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna cover up a lot of em, but some of em will show, and people will think you worked for long periods of time to create all these little things. And thats our secret, shh, dont tell nobody"
Bob Ross,"Okay, so I say most of those will disappear, but some of em will still be there, and theyll create some very nice effects. Im gonna dip the one-inch brush into a little bit of the liquid white"
Bob Ross,"I do that only to thin the paint, one of our golden rules, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Let me get a little black on there, Ill make a nice green. Black and yellow make a beautiful green"
Bob Ross,"Now look right there, see, when it starts making those little things, Steve, my son who teaches this, he tells his students when little bushes start appearing right here in this pile of paint when you"
Bob Ross,"pull it, then the brush is loaded correctly. And thats an excellent way of checking it. But you can see how it begins appearing right there. When your brush begins doing that. Then lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Then make some big decisions in here. Maybe theres a happy bush that lives right here. Touch, give a gentle push. You dont have to push hard"
Bob Ross,"If you have a thinner paint than whats on the canvas and youve loaded a lot of color into the bristles, see there, and make one little bush at a time"
Bob Ross,"I know sometimes it gets feeling good and you want to make a bunch at once. Try to make only one bush at a time. Think about em as individuals, give em names if necessary"
Bob Ross,"And thats what makes em stand out. Do the bush that in your mind is the farthest away first, and then work forward, always working forward, and that way therell be depth and distance in your work"
Bob Ross,"Little more color, and Im going through the indian yellow, the yellow ochre, cad yellow. Here and there, least little touch of the bright red. Not much, its very strong, very strong"
Bob Ross,"Itll take over your whole world in a heartbeat. But it does make some nice little color changes here and there. There. Okay, maybe another little bush right there. I tell you what, tell you what"
Bob Ross,"This looks just like a natural place to have a little path, so lets take some, well take some van dyke brown, a little dark sienna"
Bob Ross,"Pull it out very flat, once again, we cut off our little roll of paint. Now then, where does our path go. Maybe it goes right up in here"
Bob Ross,"And all were doing, once again, is putting some dark color on so our light color will show. This is just our undercolor, our base color"
Bob Ross,"And in just a few minutes, well come back and well highlight that. Well just sort let that just sorta dribble out here to nothing, just sorta let it go, we dont know. Like that"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can take some with, a little dark sienna, maybe the least little touch of bright red in it, not much. Pull it out flat, dont over mix your color. Get our little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"Now barely, barely grazing the canvas, just let the knife just barely, barely caress it"
Bob Ross,"Just so it hits the high points, and itll make it look like all those little bumps and rocks and beautiful little things happening automatically. Automatically, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can come back with our one-inch brush, and well just pop in a little bush here and there. Bring it all together. Can add a little paint thinner to your brush sometime to thin the paint"
Bob Ross,"And lets go right over here. See, well have a little bush that lives right here and hangs over the path, that way we dont have to decide where it goes"
Bob Ross,"We just know it goes somewhere back into the background. We dont know. Dont care at this point. See, just sorta let that go. Now then, tell you what I wanna do"
Bob Ross,"I wanna take the little piece of contact paper I have off and lets see what we have here. Well just grab that, pull it off, zoop, and there it goes. Now then, see, we need to get rid of these edges"
Bob Ross,"So all well do is take a little of the dark color, tap a little of that in so it just sorta flows with it. Just let it flow right on out like that"
Bob Ross,"But I wanna keep this contoured roundish idea going here, sorta makes it look a little bit better. Put some dark in, then we can come back and put all kinds of just little bushes and things in here"
Bob Ross,"See, use the side of the brush, push upward. But work in layers, always working in layers. Think about individuals. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets go back to our fan brush that has the white on it for the clouds, and lets go up in here, Im gonna find a clean two-inch brush, I wanna blend this blue here"
Bob Ross,"See this little line here, I wanna kill that, so well just blend that out and just sorta let it go backwards here. Now. Thats all you have to do, just blend it back"
Bob Ross,"And well take our cloud and allow it to come right down there. There it goes, and just let it blend right on back, see. Its right on into nothing, we dont know where it goes, we dont care"
Bob Ross,"And this one. Okay, then a nice clean brush, give it a little blend. Like so. Lift it, fluff it, and that brings that whole top section together. I tell you what, think this old painting is about done"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little of the bright red on the liner brush, a little paint thinner, and well sign this one right about here. I hope youve enjoyed this, itll certainly give you a lot of practice"
Bob Ross,"Its a beautiful little painting to do if its your first project. Think youll enjoy it. And from all of us here, happy painting and God bless, my friend. light music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today. You ready to do a fantastic little painting"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me tell you what Ive already done up here"
Bob Ross,"I have my standard ol pre-stretched double primed canvas up here, and Ive put just a thin, even coat of the liquid white over the entire surface. So its all slick and wet and its ready to go"
Bob Ross,"So, lets have some fun. I thought today is such a fantastic day here. Well just do a happy little painting. Ive had a lot of request, people asking about how to do these great big fluffy clouds"
Bob Ross,"So I thought wed work on something like that today. So lets start out, well use the ol two-inch brush, with a little touch of the phthalo bru, blue"
Bob Ross,"Blue, sometimes my tongue gets over my teeth and I cant see what Im saying. There we are. Little bit of the blue. We dont want much. Lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe, right in here, well have just a little bit of, little bit of blue right in there like so. Well just let that float right on off into nothing. A very small amount"
Bob Ross,"Well put a little color in the sky so the clouds will show up. Something like so. This is just phthalo blue, and its mixing with the liquid white thats on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"And automatically, you get a beautiful, smooth, even color in here. If this was a dry canvas, youd be in agony city about now. Now then. Without cleaning the brush, Im go into the midnight black"
Bob Ross,"Just looking for a small amount of color. Just a small amount, like so. Now then, with the black on there and the little bit of blue that was left, well have a very nice gray color"
Bob Ross,"And Ill start at the top of the canvas, making little xs, little criss-cross strokes, and blend that right down into the blue. Like that"
Bob Ross,"So that way, we graduate in color from a blue up into a nice gray. And the more you blend this, the better itll come together. So you cant tell where one color stops, and the next color starts"
Bob Ross,"And, while we have that gray going, put a little more on the brush. Maybe right down in here, well add a little bit more of the gray. There. Still making little criss-cross strokes"
Bob Ross,"And sometimes, sometimes its nice. Im reach up here and get the least little touch of alizarin crimson. Well warm that gray up a little bit"
Bob Ross,"So we have black, and a little bit of crimson on the brush, but very small amount. A very, very small amount, we dont want much. We dont want to set the sky on fire"
Bob Ross,"I just wanna change the hue a little bit, the color. The least little bit. This will warm it up. And today, I think well concentrate mainly on the sky, so Im not too worried about down here"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Now then, let me wash the ol brush. And as you know, we wash our brush with odorless paint thinner. Be sure its odorless. And we never use turpentine"
Bob Ross,"I have a screen on the bottom of the can the I scrub the brush against. Shake off the excess. banging and rhythmic beating chuckles And just beat the devil, thats the fun part of this whole thing"
Bob Ross,"Now then, in this area right in here, Im gonna go right into some titanium white, and the least little touch of yellow ochre. Putting a little yellow ochre in there. Just to brighten it up a little"
Bob Ross,"Just a little bit, we dont want much. Dont want much, okay. Now then, Im just gonna go in here, come right up to this blue, and try not to intermingle them too much"
Bob Ross,"Cause you know, if you put the yellow ochre into the blue, its gonna turn green, and we dont want that. There, just a very nice little light spot that goes right through there"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can take a little black, and maybe here and there, theres an indication, of a little streaky cloud that floats through there. We dont want many of those either. Just put em in there"
Bob Ross,"Just a couple little happy things. Then Ill take a clean brush, and I have several of each brush going here so I dont have to spend all my time washing brushes. Well just blend those. That easy"
Bob Ross,"Now. Now we can have some fun. I think Ill just use a one-inch brush, though you can do it with any ol thing"
Bob Ross,"Ill gonna go right into a little black, a little white, and I want to make just a grayish color. Least little touch of phthalo blue into it. But mostly just black and white. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go right up here. Now we have to start making some big decisions. Where does our clouds live. Lets just take, and use just the corner. Just the corner of the one-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"And lets just begin laying in some very basic little shapes here. And when youre doing this, you need to have some basic shapes. Dont just throw it in at random and think clouds will appear"
Bob Ross,"They just wont do it. The rascals are lazy, theyre like me. Maybe over in here, maybe theres a big ol cloud that floats around. I dont know"
Bob Ross,"And when you do this at home, you paint them any way that you want them, because painting is as individual as people are. You paint what you see, and what you want in your world"
Bob Ross,"We all see nature through different eyes, and we all have our own idea of the way we want things to look. And Im not trying to teach you to copy here"
Bob Ross,"The only thing I wanna do, is to show you technique, and turn you loose on the world"
Bob Ross,Every day I get letters from hundreds of people all over the country that are doing some of the most beautiful paintings youve ever seen. And thats so fantastic. There. Now then
Bob Ross,"Just begin filling it in. Just, as I say, decide where you want your big cloud to live. And drop them in, drop them in"
Bob Ross,"There, and you can put all kinds of, maybe theres a little thing that goes right out there. A little stringy thing. All were doing is putting in some basic shapes"
Bob Ross,"Well come back and well highlight all these little things. There. Just all kinds of happy little things. As I say, this whole canvas is gonna be mainly clouds. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Maybe that one runs right on out, and has a little, maybe a little projection out there. There. But this will be huge clouds. These are beautiful also if youre doing seascapes"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its nice to have these great big clouds floating around. Lets see, leave some holes once in a while. Let a little light shine through. Really makes your cloud look special when you do that"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Well just let that run. We dont know where it goes. Somewhere off in there. Now. Theres very little paint on the canvas. It may look theres a lot, but theres very little"
Bob Ross,"Were using a brush thats almost dry. Very little paint. If youre not sure, if you have a thin enough layer of paint, take just a clean, dry, two-inch brush, and just do like so"
Bob Ross,"And thatll help pick up that excess paint, and blends it all together even smoother. So thats all you have to do there. And thatll remove, as I say, thatll remove that excess paint"
Bob Ross,"Now we can just pull that. Because the canvas is wet we can move this color. There. All right. Now then, we can begin putting some highlights on here. Just begin putting some highlights"
Bob Ross,"And we can use a one-inch brush for that, or a two-inch, or fan brush. Any of them work very well. rhythmic beating There we are. Lets use a one-inch brush today, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"The round brush also is excellent for this. It works very, very well"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets just take some titanium white, be right back, Imma pick up the least little touch of the bright red, the least little touch. Now then, pull the brush in one direction. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take and go right up here, and right to the, well go slightly above the dark area. And just begin putting in all these beautiful little highlights. Tight, small little circles"
Bob Ross,"There we go. See em. Okay. Now then, just think about where lights gonna strike your cloud. There"
Bob Ross,"One of the questions were asked over and over again is where we come up with the ideas for these paintings. Mainly, they come from suggestions that people write in"
Bob Ross,"People write every day and tell me what they would like to see. And we try to paint what the majority of people write and tell us they want. rhythmic beating And well take a clean, dry brush"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna do this in layers. Very gently. Very gently. Just blend the base of it, a little bit. Just the base. Were not touching the top edges at all yet. Now, very lightly"
Bob Ross,"And this is a big circular stroke. See there. Like that. Dont go straight up, or itll look like its raining up. And that sorta disturbs your eye when you look at it"
Bob Ross,"Very lightly, just caress it a little bit. And thats all you need. And we just do that in layers. And were gonna do that in several layers here"
Bob Ross,"You know, if youve been with me before in some of the past series, you know I love to show little creatures in all the shows"
Bob Ross,"Well recently, one of my neighbors brought me over a little baby squirrel that had fell out of a tree and the kitty cat had got and they rescued it. And this is the way it looked when I got it"
Bob Ross,"Looks like a little drowned rat, doesnt it. Now thats what he looks like today. This has got to be one of the cutest little things that youve ever seen"
Bob Ross,"And Annette and I had raised this little rascal, and hes almost grown now. We call it Bobette. That way we both have our name in it. But he is the most precious little devil"
Bob Ross,"And as I say, he lives with me, and he sorta has free run of the house. He just runs around and tears up everything"
Bob Ross,"rhythmic beating But hes getting a little old for that, were gonna have to, gonna have to turn him loose pretty quick. Just about grown. There"
Bob Ross,"rhythmic beating Now, same thing, Im just working in layers, to create those big fluffy effects. Now, once again, and this is so light, so light. Gentle, very easy, very easy. Whisper"
Bob Ross,"And then just very lightly caress it. Blend it all together. rhythmic beating And Im beating the big brush between each of these blending procedures, only to remove the excess paint"
Bob Ross,"By beating it, you can take that paint off the bristles without going through the whole cleaning procedure. Okay, and well go right up in here, and add a little highlight here"
Bob Ross,"Just the same, basic ol thing, over and over. This is an excellent painting to teach you how to do clouds. Once you do this one, youll never have any problem with clouds again"
Bob Ross,"Theyll be easy from now on. Just because youve taken the time to practice. There. And you can do it, you really can do it"
Bob Ross,"Every day, as I mentioned before, I get so many letters from people who never believed they could paint or do anything creative like this, and theyre having just marvelous success"
Bob Ross,"Then thats wonderful. rhythmic beating So, let me hear from you, if you try this. Send me a photograph of whats happening"
Bob Ross,"Every once in a while we put em together and we like to show em on the program here, and I just enjoy, I enjoy seeing em. It really makes all this worthwhile"
Bob Ross,"Just that fact that people are taking this method of painting, and creating some of the most beautiful masterpieces. And it makes people happy"
Bob Ross,"They may not hang in the Smithsonian, but they certainly look good in our living rooms. There. Okay, and as I say, we just do this over and over and over. And work in layers, always working in layers"
Bob Ross,That way youll have distance and depth in your cloud. They wont just be ol flat clouds laying out here. We want our clouds to have some life in em. There we go
Bob Ross,"We have a lot of skies like this in Florida, where I live. Especially in the afternoon. And theyre so pretty"
Bob Ross,"Maybe over in here, just wanna work em around and look, and see where you think there oughta be things. There we go. Theres another one. See, this will also help you expand your imagination"
Bob Ross,"Painting, if you paint for any length of time, your imagination will just sorta go amuck, as they say. Because imagination may be the most valued thing that an artist has"
Bob Ross,"rhythmic beating And it, like anything else, develops with practice. The more you use your imagination, the better it becomes. Its like a muscle in our body"
Bob Ross,"You want it to expand and get bigger, you use it. Take it to the point of exertion, then it grows. Its the same with your imagination"
Bob Ross,"rhythmic beating If you dont use it, it just gets tired and lazy. There. Okay, but always in circles here. Dont ever just go straight up. It really will look like its raining up"
Bob Ross,"But by the same token, if you want to show rain coming out of the bottom of this cloud, all you have to do is grab a little of this dark and pull down"
Bob Ross,"I really dont wanna do rain today, but should you want to do rain, or show what rain way off into the distance, all you do is just grab, see like that, and pull it downward"
Bob Ross,light scratching Thats all there is to it. Aint that a wild sky. And you can do that in just a couple of minutes. There. light scratching All right
Bob Ross,"Maybe just a touch more of the gray down here, and well just let this come way down. Little bit more of the crimson. And just blend it all together. Very soft, and very gentle"
Bob Ross,"light scratching Now then, maybe maybe in our world, maybe way back here in the distance, maybe theres a little hill"
Bob Ross,"Well just take some gray, which is just the midnight black, and Im just working a very small amount of it into the bristles. Very small amount"
Bob Ross,"Maybe the least little touch of the phthalo blue with it. Not much. Not much. Just enough to tint it a little bit. Okay, lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a nice little foothill that lives way back in the distance here. Or a little mountain, depending on where youre from. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And well put a little point on it, and let it come right on down. And all were doing is just barely tapping with a two-inch brush, very simple. Now then. Just follow the basic shape we want"
Bob Ross,"light tapping There. Just want this to be far away. Now then, at the base of this, I wanna create the illusion of mist. rhythmic beating And to do that, take a clean, dry, two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"And Im just gonna tap it, firmly, right at the base. Right on the bottom. Just tap it. And thatll blend the liquid white, and automatically, that illusion of mist will occur"
Bob Ross,"Lift it upward, very lightly, and that easy. We got a happy little hill that lives way back here in the distance somewhere. Lets see, well just take ol dirty brush here"
Bob Ross,"And weve used, my gosh, well over three quarters of the entire canvas just doing the sky. And you say my, my gosh Bob, you didnt leave enough"
Bob Ross,"You didnt leave enough room down here to do something in the bottom. Well, we have a little time left, so lets just have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Well take some van dyke brown, little dark sienna, a little black, little crimson. Whatever. Maybe even the least little touch of sap green in there. Okay. tapping Now then"
Bob Ross,"Lets have, back in here. Lets put the indication, of some little trees. light scraping Just little bushes and trees that live way back in here. light scraping There they are"
Bob Ross,"See, just happy little thing, and Im just using the corner of the two-inch brush. Thats all were doing"
Bob Ross,"light scraping And just worry about very basic shape, thats all were looking for at this point. Very, very basic little shapes. Nothing else"
Bob Ross,"light scraping Now then, maybe that comes, we dont know where it goes. Dont know that we even care at this point. light scraping Now. We have, in reality, weve put nothing down here"
Bob Ross,"This is all just, watch what happens now"
Bob Ross,"Make a decision, touch it with a little bit of phthalo blue with the brush, very little, and make a decision where you think water would be underneath here, and just pull it straight down"
Bob Ross,"Straight down. Thatll blend with the liquid white thats on the canvas, and automatically, automatically we can create the illusion of water, just by going across like that. There"
Bob Ross,"Now well come back and well put all kind of highlights and all that stuff, okay"
Bob Ross,"Okay, Ill just keep on using the two-inch brush here, what the heck, you could use round brush here, one-inch brush or whatever. Just go tap a little bit of color right into the corner of it here"
Bob Ross,"Right into the corner. Well use some yellow ochre, little indian yellow, cad yellow. Maybe a touch of the bright red here and there. Let me reach up here and get the least little touch of green"
Bob Ross,"There. Alright, now. Just using the top corner of the brush, lets just go in here, and tap in some beautiful little highlights on these little trees and bushes. And we vary the colors"
Bob Ross,I dont wanna use the same colors over and over. But Im just gonna vary em so itll look like theres a lot of bushes rather than just a few. See there
Bob Ross,"tapping Okay, grab a little bit of black on the brush, mix that with yellow, thatll make us a nice green. There. Now you can do this in fall colors, or spring colors, whatever"
Bob Ross,"Its very individual, you sorta look and make a decision. Ooh, nice one, nice one there, a little bit of red in that. There we go. Theres another one, whatever"
Bob Ross,"light tapping As I say, you can do this with a round brush very nicely, and make the same effect. Same, identical effect. There"
Bob Ross,"But layers, always layers, if you want that illusion of depth in your painting. There we go"
Bob Ross,"If you wanted spring colors, for example, in the greens, Id use a little phthalo green, rather than sap green. Thatll give you much brighter, more sparkly greens"
Bob Ross,"I dont know if thats a word or not, but you know what Im saying. Greens that are vibrant, jump out at you. If youre looking for spring. There, maybe another little bush lives right there"
Bob Ross,"Now then, with a clean knife, we can go back up in here, and just take the point of the knife and scrape in the indication of some trunks, and twigs and sticks, and all those little things that live"
Bob Ross,"out in here. But mainly in the dark areas. Mainly in the dark areas. There we go. And maybe, in our world, grab ol two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"tapping Well take a little yellow, grab a little black here, make some green. Now, when you lower this brush, tap it firmly into the color"
Bob Ross,"See, and give it a push, so that the tips of the bristle are loaded there, see. Give it a little push. Thats where the paints at now. Its right at the tip"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe right along in here, maybe theres a little bit of a little grass growing right along here. Some happy little things. All you have to do is just tap it. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Now, once again, if you get a little of that color into your water, dont worry about it, cause all you have to do is grab it, and pull it down, like so, and go gently across, thats all there is to"
Bob Ross,"it. Now then. Lets have us a little waterline there. For that, well take a little liquid white, a little titanium white. Just mix em together. I put the liquid white into the titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Only to thin the color. Im gonna take the least little touch of blue in that, just a, ooh, thats nice. Thats nice. Okay, now, take a little bit of that on the knife, small roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets go right up in here, and just sort of pull this. Just let it wiggle, and pull, and well make like a sandbar or bank that lives right out there. See here, just pull it"
Bob Ross,"You can just make all kinds of little things. That easy. That easy. And then we can go back in here if you want, put in a few little lines and stuff, just to smooth it out, bring it all together"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you want em. Wherever. Okay, tell you what, lets take us a round brush here. Well go right into some brown, dark sienna, little bit of black, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets come right up in here. tapping And lets just tap in the indication of some happy little trees. Were just using the ol round brush today. tapping There. See there"
Bob Ross,"But all were looking for is very basic shapes. Thats all were looking for at this point. Well come back and well put highlights in here. But right now, thats all we want. Just little shapes"
Bob Ross,"Lets go on the other side and do some things over here, too. We dont want it left out. Maybe over here lives big tree. Great big ol tree. tapping Then he comes right down like so"
Bob Ross,Maybe he lives up here in the sky. This is the big boss tree here. He looks around and watches everything. King of the mountain. King of the mountain right here
Bob Ross,"This would be the tree my little squirrel would wanna live in. There we are. You can just tap this on, you could put this on with a paint roller, it doesnt matter. Any ol way you wanna. There we go"
Bob Ross,"All were doing is just filling that in color, just blocking it in, basically. Now then, I have several of these brushes. Im gonna take another one. Put the least little touch of liquid white on it"
Bob Ross,"And go right into a little bit of yellow, a little bit of green. Tap it firmly, tap it firmly. Get a little yellow ochre once in while, too. Thats nice. Now then, go right above the dark"
Bob Ross,"Look at that, look at that. This ol round brush just does beautiful, beautiful things. But you can put all of these little highlights in. There we go"
Bob Ross,"See, and think about all kinda little individual things that are happening in here. Theres limbs in here. These are not just at random. Dont just hit it random. You want your tree to have character"
Bob Ross,"You want it to be a special tree. Think about shape and form. And maybe down in here maybe down in here theres a ooh thats nice, its got a little red in it. A little of the bright red"
Bob Ross,And theres a happy bush. Lives right there. And hes got a little friend right there. But see how easy these things are to make using this ol round brush
Bob Ross,"And you can grab the bottom of that, and just pull it down. Just pull it down. That color right into the water. Go across. That easy"
Bob Ross,"Take a little van dyke brown, and well turn it right into a little bit of land there. A little white and brown for highlight. Drop that right in. Like that. Little touch of our liquid white"
Bob Ross,"See there. Then you just scratch in a stick and a twig and all those things. Okay, lets go on the other side here. Over here, same basic thing. Look at that, though"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that a fantastic little painting that you can do in just a couple of minutes. Well, the ol clock on the wall tells me to its about time to shut it down for the day"
Bob Ross,"As Im finishing up here, Id like to extend the invitation for you to try this painting, and see how it works, and let me know. I really would like to know how everything goes"
Bob Ross,Ill just put that in there. Take our big brush. Tap in a little grassy area like so. And I think this ones about done. That easy. Hope youve enjoyed this one. Were gonna call that one finished
Bob Ross,"And from all of us here, happy painting, and God bless. jazz music"
Bob Ross,hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic little painting good tell you what lets start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you
Bob Ross,need to paint along with us and theyll come across as usual in the same order as we have them on the pallet starting with the white and working around let me tell you what Ive already done today
Bob Ross,today as you can plainly see we have a black canvas up here now we we get this by just taking a white canvas and covering it with black gesso letting that dry completely then on top of that Ive taken
Bob Ross,today and Ive covered the whole canvas with a thin let me say that again a thin coat of liquid clear and then over top of that Ive just put a tiny tiny bit of phthalo blue so we have liquid clear
Bob Ross,and then phthalo blue I put the clear on there only to make the blue go much easier and I want a very thin coat of the blue on there I dont want a whole bunch today and I thought maybe today we do a
Bob Ross,fantastic little winter scene and Ill show you how easy that can lets start out with a little titanium white just a small amount we use a 1-in brush but we could use any old thing 2in brush it work
Bob Ross,just as well but since we picked this one up well use it now then I want to make the indication here of just happy little Cloud things that are happening there and were just sort of going to bounce
Bob Ross,this around and let it play and just make all kinds of little shapes but always keep the brush moving I dont want a lot of color in one in place and you can see that Whites picking up all that
Bob Ross,beautiful blue thats underneath and these things will just happen if you painted with me before you know I mentioned quite frequently when youre doing these black canvases with a transparent color
Bob Ross,on them that if youll put the color on before you start painting in front of someone and then you then you start this and you take your brush and go into a little bit of white paint and then touch
Bob Ross,this people will think its magic because they wont understand why this is happening there we go and it really makes a its a sensation when it happens people just go crazy over it so if youre ever
Bob Ross,out painting for someone think about these theyre a lot of fun on the black canvases youll find that color stands out much much more than it does on a white canvas just jumps out at you use that to
Bob Ross,your advantage I love these black canvases you can create some of the most Striking Effects and theyre very simple to do this black gesso is one of the neatest things that Ive ever came up with
Bob Ross,there now then see we left a lot of these holes in here though dont just cover it all up leave these spots now watch well take well take a good clean dry 2in brush and lets just begin blending
Bob Ross,this together now you can blend this to any degree of lightness or darkness that you want the more that you work it and Im just using the corner of the brush the more that you work this the darker
Bob Ross,itll become because itll pick up that color its underneath so you have to make a big decision right off in this painting how dark do you want your sky or how light and you can always go back and
Bob Ross,add more of the titanium white anytime that you desire and you can make it shoot you can make it some bright it hurts your eyes if you want to and thats an individual thing you make it any way that
Bob Ross,makes you happy there we are see and that quick we have a very nice effective little sky and just very gently well blend the brush Strokes out but by putting this liquid clear on here then you can
Bob Ross,put a very very small amount of phthalo blue so when you put the white its not its not so bright blue that is hurts the eyes that way its almost like a glaze on there tell you what lets have some
Bob Ross,fun lets take some black we use some black little Prussian Blue lizard and Crimson uh Little vany Brown what the heck doesnt matter whatever you want lets build us a little mountain in this one
Bob Ross,pull the paint out as flat as you can get it go right down here with a knife cut across and get that small roll of paint lives right out on the end of the blade there we go now then come right up in
Bob Ross,here you have to make a big decision see we start right in here decide where you want Mountain to live and all were looking for is a nice top shape were not worried about the bottom of the mountain
Bob Ross,or anything else at this point the only thing were trying to do is get us a basic shape in here so make up a shape or look at mountains in your area or get a nice book it has mountains in it whatever
Bob Ross,mountains come in all shapes and sizes some big some small some dark some light theyre like people they have personalities that are that are different and unique so when you make your Mountain dont
Bob Ross,just try to copy this one make any kind of mountain that makes you happy there all were interested in once again is this nice edge up on top we dont care whats happening in here but scrape off all
Bob Ross,the excess paint now with a clean dry brush we want to grab this and begin moving it you can literally pull this paint around the canvas is wet from the clear and the color that we have on there so we
Bob Ross,can move this color if this was a dry canvas itd be very difficult theres very little color on the canvas very little we have scraped it very hard and now were brushing it out so all we have left
Bob Ross,on here is just basically a stain in the canvas very very little color there there we go very little paint now today shoot lets have some fun today lets come up here well take a little white a
Bob Ross,little bit of white little white well reach over here get a little dark Sienna and put in there maybe even a little van Dy its up to you but well make a color about like so whatever whatever now
Bob Ross,then this very small roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife now lets start making some decisions in here first thing you have to decide is where your lights coming from I think maybe today
Bob Ross,lets have the light coming from the left side but you can change that in your painting if you want it coming from the right doesnt matter and begin thinking about little ideas and basic shapes and
Bob Ross,and how you want things to be in your world here see maybe theres a little thing it comes right down we dont know maybe it comes down like that there just sort of Let It Go maybe it comes right on
Bob Ross,down mountains are a great deal of fun and mountains will teach you how to use the equipment teach you how to use the knife and thats thats fantastic if you learn to use this knife you cant believe
Bob Ross,what itll do but you have to make friends with it you have to devote a little time to working with it but very quickly youll be doing things with it that you you didnt believe was possible to do
Bob Ross,with a big old thing looks like a putty knife here there just begin thinking about the shapes that you want in there maybe outd here just a little indication but you barely touch the canvas allow the
Bob Ross,knife just to sort of graze it to slide along just float through here the lightest touch that you can come up with is just right absolutely just whisper absolutely whisper probably one of the biggest
Bob Ross,questions that I hear over and over again is why cant I make this paint break like this two things normally cause the problem either the paint is too thin because you need a very dry thick paint to
Bob Ross,do this or the other thing is applying too much pressure very little pressure little bit right there want just just enough to let a little light tweak right through there now then we can take well
Bob Ross,take a little white a little white maybe a little of the Prussian Blue little lizard and Crimson will make us a nice lavender color but very dark this is going to be the shadow so we want it to be
Bob Ross,quite dark once again our little roll of paint now then we can begin coming back in here and we dont want too much but here and there just put the indication of some little highlights that live in
Bob Ross,here now its very easy to get carried away with these once again we dont want too many just a few just a few keep them quite dark there and now you can begin putting in indications of individual
Bob Ross,little things in here all kinds of little things just wherever you think they should be just a few though once again this will get too bright on you very easily so dont overdo it gets to feel good
Bob Ross,sometime and you just keep going and going and going and and then its then you have to go back and put your dark back in but you can do that too thats not a big deal you can go back and put your
Bob Ross,dark right back in there we go see theres a lot of different things happening up here in this mountain its just not a plain old mountain theres a lot of things maybe let me take a little bit of
Bob Ross,titanium white with at least little touch of phthalo blue in it just a least little touch just want to cool it off a little there we are just a little pull it out flat and once again our little roll
Bob Ross,of paint now maybe theres a little maybe theres some snow lays right in here a little little maybe its a little Glacier shoot who knows just begin thinking about the shape and form and how it would
Bob Ross,lay in there there see there we just put it in very lightly little bit more of the blue and white there and that blue gives it sort of a cold feeling blue is a very cool color so maybe it comes right
Bob Ross,down there so we dont know where it goes just let it sort of bend around and play in there climbs up a side of that and go back into your Browns just sort of bring it all together but its
Bob Ross,unbelievable what you can make here back into the Browns as we get farther down this mountain but see how that color stands out against that black background its fantastic absolutely fantastic maybe
Bob Ross,up in here well just a little too sharp for me I want to break that up a little so its not quite as sharp there okay and we can go back to our original dark color and just pull in a few very dark
Bob Ross,recessed Shadow areas but very very dark see grab a little that color let them just sort of blend together but its very dark there see okay good and with that you can make just unbelievable mountains
Bob Ross,but devote a little time to practicing shoot you will not believe what you can make very soon there we go and here Im just rubbing very hard just just to push all that color right into the fabric
Bob Ross,there we go we just let that come right on we dont know where that goes maybe Ill put a big tree right over there okay Sho we got one fantastic Mountain going right there and we can take a 2-in
Bob Ross,brush and the least little touch of white paint on it titanium white least little touch oh just barely touch it now I want to just begin blending little that white I want to create the illusion of
Bob Ross,nice soft Misty areas down here at the base so we take that white and just do little circles tiny little circles and we can tap thatll bring it all together there but you can create areas that are so
Bob Ross,Misty and soft and quiet that easy there we go its easy to overdo once again color stands out so strong against this black that its very easy to overdo so dont dont get carried away there we are
Bob Ross,now then were not worried about the bottom I think Ill put some little trees down there what the heck trees at the base of the mountain are always very pretty and over in here well just tap a
Bob Ross,little just to soften right in here where they come together there now just like making clouds here you can put several layers if you want you can create the illusion of layers of mist laying here can
Bob Ross,do very easy just let your imagination take you wherever you want to go its all you have to do all righty now then lets get the old knife lets take well just use this dark color we just using
Bob Ross,thats the mountain color maybe maybe Ill add a little bit more black to that on on it gray maybe a little bit Theo blue black phthalo blue and some brown and Crimson thats all it is there okay let
Bob Ross,me wipe off my knife well grab an old fan brush today this is a number six fan brush but but the number three would work just as well and some people like the number three because it gives you maybe
Bob Ross,a little more controls a little smaller maybe back here in this Mist we have some happy little trees that live back in here just the indication of little distant trees that are far away see now that
Bob Ross,little Misty area we put in there thats the only thing that makes those little rascals pop out at you otherwise they would just hide back here in that dark area but because we put that little Mist
Bob Ross,now they come alive another little trick you can do is take a little bit of light color doesnt matter what it is grab the bottom and lift upward make it look like hundreds of little tree trunks that
Bob Ross,are far away back here thats sneaky huh thats a lazy way of putting in a bunch of Tree Trunks very simply and then I have several fan brushes going so were just taking another mix up some color
Bob Ross,here well take some white some phthalo blue now I want to make several different grades of this so well take white here and Ill just bring a little that into it so now we have a much darker value
Bob Ross,up here than down here but its all the same color so we can have different variations of the same color in one pile let me clean off my knife okay well grab another fan brush as I say I have several
Bob Ross,of them going here that ones clean so well use him take a little that blue just loaded into the bristles little bit of the light color see theres all kinds of things happening in there its not one
Bob Ross,dead old color now maybe right in here theres some bigger trees that live they live right about here and I push upward today see give it a little upward push and we can make just all kinds of happy
Bob Ross,little Evergreens these are a little bigger theyre a little closer to us make a decision how many live in your world and drop them in just push upward with a corner of the fan brush though maybe
Bob Ross,theres a little one lives right here and this is just playing lights against dark darks against light etc etc and thats what gives you all these beautiful little effects now when youre doing this
Bob Ross,make a decision once again decide how many trees live in your world here and just pop them in maybe back in here going put some little bushes right here at the base of this see there just pop in some
Bob Ross,little but all Im doing is pushing upward with a fan brush thats all theres to it now then I want to create some Mist at the base of these little trees Ill take a 2in brush and very firmly tapping
Bob Ross,with the top corner of the brush just tap those trees frees and you can distort that diffuse it and itll create that illusion of mist and right on the base of this we can do the same thing if we want
Bob Ross,you can just make all kinds of beautiful little Misty effects that easy there we go now sh we just use that same old brush doesnt matter well go right into titanium white with it just put some
Bob Ross,titanium wait on it there we are like so now then decide where your snows going to live just come right here we can watch right in here okay now just pull see just make a big decision give it a pull
Bob Ross,wherever you want it to go at that a super way to put some snow in your painting its that easy though that easy and once again look how this stands out against that black hurt your eyes if youre
Bob Ross,not careful it just stands right out there maybe maybe theres a little river or something that lives in our painting make a decision where you think it lives pull it down straight down okay now take
Bob Ross,a clean brush this is clean and very dry be sure its clean and dry now thats mixing with the blue thats underneath here very gently go across and that quick we have instant reflections of a nice
Bob Ross,Shimmer on the water okay maybe maybe let me find another fan brush there it is knew I had one somewhere here well take the blue and the white just mix them together maybe theres a larger evergreen
Bob Ross,tree that lives here in our world I want to add a little dark color to that too just to dull it a little there we go little black into it just to dull it down oh thats nice thats nice dont want it
Bob Ross,too bright maybe our tree lives right there just make a decision put it in once again were going to take the corner of the brush and begin pushing upward now sometimes we make evergreen trees by
Bob Ross,pushing downward with a brush sometimes upward just sort of depends on how your mood is look around at trees and your area and see how they look or how youre feeling that day whatever theyre
Bob Ross,individuals just like painters so you make them any way that you want them there just want to show you different ways of making them and you you decide maybe there some little grassy things coming
Bob Ross,down through here I dont know now we can take the fan brush and begin making big decisions where all this lives very gently barely touching just caress the canvas and smooth all that out see here
Bob Ross,that comes well make a distinct little Peninsula that comes right down into the water there there like so but just barely touching you can make this so smooth it looks like Silk or you can leave it a
Bob Ross,little rough its up to you up to you now you know me I always think these are such beautiful places to live maybe lets have a little cabin lives right here easiest way that I found Mak a cabin is
Bob Ross,start by scraping out a basic shape this does two things first of all it allows you to lay out your cabin without being committed maybe most important it removes the excess paint and that makes your
Bob Ross,life a lot easier find me a spot to work take some van Dy Brown and lets go right up here we do the back Eve how we have it brown we can just fill this in all were doing here is just blocking in
Bob Ross,color thats really all were doing just blocking in color were not committed were not worried about it just putting some color on the canvas now then put a roof a little white there it is see how
Bob Ross,easy that is you can do that there so all you have to do just drop it in pay attention to your angles though angles are very important when youre doing buildings okay a little snow on the other side
Bob Ross,there we are cute little house take a little brown and white barely touching the canvas make us look like oh wood tired of wood now on the other side if you put anything over here at all very dark
Bob Ross,very dark cuz its going to be in Shadow okay maybe tell you what I have a little door here thats all you got to do take a little color on the knife a little dark color you can cut through make
Bob Ross,indication of some boards well do a cabin ectomy there you go just cut it off to whatever size you want that easy with our fan brush come back in here little little snow down here to at the bottom
Bob Ross,take a little blue and white make the indication maybe of a little path coming out there I dont know whatever just make up little stories in your mind maybe theres an Old Trapper lived here maybe
Bob Ross,one day he maybe fell off in here in the river shoot who knows we dont know tell you what lets get crazy lets take some dark color well take some black some phthalo blue Prussian Blue lizard
Bob Ross,Crimson it dont matter long as its good dark color on the 2in brush you know me I love these old Big Trees lets do a big tree lets go right over here on this left side maybe in our world lives a
Bob Ross,big tree right there Im going to do them the same way I did the little ones take the corner of the brush and just give it little upward pushes its all there is to it see there think about shape and
Bob Ross,form dont just hit it random though and you can create a beautiful tree just using his great big old brush its all there is to it big tree lets go on the other side we dont want it left out maybe
Bob Ross,this tree over here is a monster maybe it went clean off the canvas all right we can do that too we have no limits to our world youre only limited by your imagination only limited by your imagination
Bob Ross,and the good Lord puts No Boundaries on that so we can go anywhere we want to go with our imagination dont even have to see your friendly travel agent for that there anywhere you want to go maybe
Bob Ross,this tree lives right out here shoot right in front of our house there we go just coming ride over like that that pushes that cabin way back here in the woods like that maybe maybe theres some bushes
Bob Ross,and stuff to live down in here now then without cleaning the brush Im just going to go into a little touch of white and phthalo blue now then go right back up here and very lightly decide where your
Bob Ross,highlights are and just push upward the same way but dont overdo you want this tree to stay quite dark and just put in the indication of a few happy little highlights here and there there see there
Bob Ross,that something theres some right here like that and well go on the other side and give his little tree some we dont want him left out there he is but still thinking about shape and form and all
Bob Ross,those happy little things that go on in there its most most important now back to her fan brush lets put over here so you can use this fan brush maybe theres big stones and stuff all underneath
Bob Ross,here we dont I dont know where it is see you can put all kinds of things by just jiggling and wiggling that brush looks like its this is rough thats what my dog said and he sat down the Sandpaper
Bob Ross,he said rough on the other side little touch right there I like that ist that a fantastic way to do a beautiful little winter scene put a few little finishing touches in there shoot thats son of
Bob Ross,guns all done hope youve enjoyed this one itll really give you give you a nice painting to do so I think well call that one finished and from all of us here happy painting and God bless my friend
Bob Ross,Music
Bob Ross,"I thought today wed do just a beautiful little painting, and what Ive done here is Ive taken and covered the canvas with a piece of contact paper that has an oval cut in it, and then Ive covered"
Bob Ross,"this whole area in here with black gesso, allowed that to dry completely, and we just went over that and covered the entire black area with a little bit of alizarin crimson and just covered the entire"
Bob Ross,"black area from top to bottom. So I tell you what, lets start out, have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this little painting with me"
Bob Ross,"And while theyre doing that, shoot, lets go on up here and get started. I thought wed just do something thats very bright and happy, make you feel good inside"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out today with a little bit of cad yellow on the two-inch brush, and well just tap a little bit of color into the bristles like so. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now today we have to make a decision right up front. We have to decide basically where our horizons gonna be, and well start there, and make sure its not dead in the center of your painting"
Bob Ross,"Put it to one side or the other, a little up, little down, but not dead center. Maybe right in here, start in that area and begin making little xs. Thatll be your lightest area right there"
Bob Ross,"And its gonna pick up the alizarin crimson and all kinds of beautiful little things will happen. Just like so, and work from that light area out. Continually blending outward"
Bob Ross,"And as your brush picks up more and more of the crimson, automatically its gonna get darker and darker in value as you work out from that lightest area"
Bob Ross,"There, now then, now we can do this as many times as we want to achieve a desired lightness. But each and every time, you go back, you wash your brush, and be sure you start with a clean, dry brush"
Bob Ross,"Shake it off. banging chuckling And just beat the devil out of it. But as I say, now maybe we wanna make this really bright"
Bob Ross,"We could take a little titanium white on our brush and then go into the yellow. There we go, now then, just load a little color on it. Lets go right up here, back to our bright area"
Bob Ross,Always start in that brightest area. And then begin blending outward. Always blending outward
Bob Ross,"And you dont want to carry this dirty brush back into your light area or youll lose that nice, bright area. Okay"
Bob Ross,"One thing that you will find when youre applying color over a black canvas is transparent color. Sometimes its very difficult to rub that on there cause we use a very firm, dry, thick paint"
Bob Ross,"If youll put the least little coat of liquid clear on here first, then youll find its very easy to put that color on. But a very, very thin coat"
Bob Ross,Probably the biggest mistake made is applying too much of the liquid clear. banging And we can dry our brush again
Bob Ross,"Now then, I just wanna blend this all out, bring it together, and well start doing some fun little things back in here. There. Very lightly go across. Okay, now then, lets make us a mixture"
Bob Ross,"Lets make a mixture of, tell you what, lets use alizarin crimson, alizarin crimson and a little phthalo blue. Proportionately much, much more crimson than blue. The blue is many times stronger"
Bob Ross,"So use a lot more crimson than blue. Sounds like a good song title. There we are, now then, let me clean off my old knife"
Bob Ross,"And I just wipe the knife on old paper towel, shoot, any old thing, clean ragll do. Now then, lets just take, well just keep using this old two-inch brush, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"Just get a little color on it and tap it. That loads the end of the bristles with color. Just tap it, see, give it a little push, little extra push right there. Now then, lets make some big decisions"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres some beautiful little bushes that live right down here. Like so, now then, begin thinking about very basic shape and form and all those kind of things"
Bob Ross,"And I like to do the bottom of the bush first and then work upward. That way, automatically, automatically your bush will get lighter in value as you work upward"
Bob Ross,"Or your tree, this ones turning into a tree. See there. Thats all there is to it. And then we have a basic shape here for a very nice little tree"
Bob Ross,"Now over here on the other side, put a little more color on your brush. Maybe theres another little bush lives right there. And were still using just the corner of the two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"So often we avoid this brush because its big, but itll do some of the most beautiful little detail things of all the brushes we use. Look there. I love these little black canvas scenes"
Bob Ross,"They are so pretty, and you can make such beautiful things happen. There, color stands out so good against this black gesso"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe in our world, shoot, we dont know, maybe theres some big trees that are way back in here. And I wanna do these very subdued, very quiet. You do this when the brush is almost out of paint"
Bob Ross,Thesell be the little background trees that are far away. There we go. And you just make a decision where they live and drop em in
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe theres another big tree that lives here in the front. Well make him a little bit darker so it stands out. There. But just sorta let your imagination go"
Bob Ross,Make decisions where you think things would live in your world and drop it in
Bob Ross,"Thats really when you begin experiencing the joy of painting is when you dont have to spend all your time thinking about how to make a procedure, but what to make, thats when it really becomes fun"
Bob Ross,"Thats when you really taste the freedom. And to me, painting represents freedom because on this canvas, I can create any kind of world that I want, and so can you. Any kind of world that you want"
Bob Ross,"I think Ive mentioned in past series, I spent half my life in the military playing soldier"
Bob Ross,"In the evenings I could come home, take off my old military hat, and get out the paintbrush, and Id create the kind of world that I wanted. Theres no bad guys in here, no guns"
Bob Ross,"This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. And thats where I really wanted to be. I didnt want to play soldier all the time"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little paint thinner and go right into that same color with the liner brush. But a lot of paint thinner, you want this to be very thin, almost ink consistency, turning the bristles"
Bob Ross,"That brings it to a nice, sharp point. Lets go up here, now then, we can go in here, and we can begin putting in all kinds of little tree trunks, stems, whatever you want. Just wherever you want em"
Bob Ross,"There. See, just all kinds of little happy things. Now if your paint does not flow like that, chances are, its too thick"
Bob Ross,"Add a little bit more of the paint thinner, and I think thatll eliminate the problem. But it should flow right over the top of this thick paint very easy"
Bob Ross,"And if youre using a thick paint, once again, and it does not flow, add a little more of the paint thinner, thats all you have to do"
Bob Ross,"There, and we can put some indications back here on these bigger trees. All these little details here"
Bob Ross,"See, you always have a lot of sticks and twigs that grow out in the woods, so that makes it pretty. Very nice. There"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, maybe we can see the indication of something that, mm, there it is, big old thing that lives right there. Let your brush wiggle and jiggle and have fun"
Bob Ross,"Tree trunks, sometimes, oh, theyre all gnarly. I hope thats a word, but you know what I mean. They have wiggles and bends in em. Theyve had rough lives"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, maybe they got stepped on, all kinds of things. Now who knows. But dont just make em all straight. It gets very boring very rapidly"
Bob Ross,"There, now we can see the indication here and there of just little things that are protruding out from between the little limbs, all these little things"
Bob Ross,"You know, I get letters from so many people, and they tell me banging of their successes and how well this is working for em and the fact that people actually wanna buy their paintings, and theyre"
Bob Ross,"very, very shocked over that. They say, Gosh, you know, I never dreamed anybodyd wanna buy something that I painted"
Bob Ross,Dont be surprised when that happens because people will like what youre doing and they wont believe that youre doing em
Bob Ross,"I get letters from people say, My family does not believe I done this myself.  They will not believe, and money is not important"
Bob Ross,"Money only is a way, if you sell your painting, its a way of, its your report card"
Bob Ross,"its people telling you that I enjoy your work so much that Im willing to give you my hard-earned happy buck for it. Thats really a supreme compliment, even if you dont sell your work"
Bob Ross,"Its a big, big compliment. Im taking a little titanium white, a little bit of that same lavender color. Let me get a little more white here. There we go, lighten that up a little"
Bob Ross,"Now tap the bristles, tap em, there we go. See how that pushes, but theres a little bit of paint"
Bob Ross,"You can see that little ridge thats left on the palette there, theres also one that corresponds to that on the end of your bristles. Thats what were looking for"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up here, now with that, we can come in here and very lightly put in a few indications of just little highlights, see em. We dont wanna get too much"
Bob Ross,"Just enough to show some little sparklies on these trees. Not too much, there we go. Over here. Since our light source is right in the middle, well highlight the other side. There we go. All right"
Bob Ross,"You never believed you could do that with a big old brush I bet, and you can. You really and truly can. Im gonna add a little touch of the phthalo blue to that just to blue it down a little"
Bob Ross,"And lets go right up in here. Cause were getting away from the light source, I want it to get a little darker, a little more into the bluer cool tones"
Bob Ross,"Blue is a very cool color, where your reds and yellows and stuff are very warm. So play not only light against dark, but warm against cool. There, makes beautiful, beautiful effects in your painting"
Bob Ross,"And this big old tree up here, there we go. Well just put some happy little things hanging out here on him, too, or her, whatever the case may be. There"
Bob Ross,"This is one of the neatest, nicest ways of painting trees. And even if youve never painted before, thisll work for you, this is a very simple painting. Very simple. Guaranteed success"
Bob Ross,"But like anything else, the more you do it, the better youre gonna get at it"
Bob Ross,"Cause with practice comes confidence, youre familiar with your tools and what they will do, youre familiar with the colors and how theyll behave, how they mix"
Bob Ross,And one of the things we try to do is keep the number of colors that you need to do this very limited so you learn what each color will do and the characteristics of that color
Bob Ross,"And it makes life easier for you. Im just gonna go in here and begin putting in layers, a few little layers of things, work in layers, always"
Bob Ross,"Just like so, do the thing that you believe is farthest away first, and then work forward, forward, forward. Always working forward. There we go"
Bob Ross,"There, see, but you just put layer after layer after layer. All right, and things begin happening, see, theres a little thing left in here. Im beginning to see all kinds of happy little things"
Bob Ross,"You can take the books that we have that go with the series and like take a tree out of one painting and maybe a lake out of another one or a building, and put em together and make all kinds of new"
Bob Ross,"compositions. Theyre only intended as guides to help you learn the technique and to have an idea. Shoot, mix em up. Lets have some fun, maybe theres some little grassy areas that live in here"
Bob Ross,"Lets go, well go right into a little bit of yellow, Ill grab a little black, when you touch that there, it makes a beautiful green color"
Bob Ross,"A little yellow ochre, indian yellow, little bright red here and there. Once again, tap that brush, get that little bit of paint right out on the end, lets go back up here"
Bob Ross,"Now you gotta make some big decisions here. Maybe theres some grassy areas that live up here. Where they live, make a decision, and begin dropping em in"
Bob Ross,"Begin dropping em in, see there, work in layers, though. I know you get tired of hearing that, but its so important. Start with the area thats farthest away and work forward"
Bob Ross,"And you know what Im beginning to see here. I bet youve seen it already, too. Wouldnt this be a perfect place to have a happy little stream that lives. Maybe well do that"
Bob Ross,"Just looks like a natural place to have one. Tell you what, tell you what, lets do that. Lets take, see, you get crazy sometimes when you do this, but thats all right"
Bob Ross,"You know, if youre a painter, youre allowed to be a little different, people expect that. So take advantage of that"
Bob Ross,"Cut off a little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife, there it is, lets go up here. Decide where your stream beds gonna be. Maybe its gonna live right in here"
Bob Ross,"Im just putting some dark on so our waterll have some place to run. Just van dyke brown, a little dark sienna. Thisll be our ground area now"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe, maybe itll fall, lets have it fall right here, what the heck. Shoot, you can do anything, you can do anything. Anything that your heart can imagine, you can do. At least on this canvas"
Bob Ross,"There, a little brown and white. Tiny little roll of paint. And Im just gonna let that barely graze here and there"
Bob Ross,"Just want an indication here and there of a little highlight, not much, just a little"
Bob Ross,"Just a little, make it look like all kind of little land areas in there, but look how color comes out against this dark canvas, it sparkles. Just absolutely sparkles"
Bob Ross,"You can just put it on little things like that, and who knows, and then go back with your dark color, your browns and stuff, and change that into rocks just by pulling down a little bit"
Bob Ross,Allow a little bit of that white to touch it. I hope you can see that. But you can create all kinds of illusions of stones and rocks and little shelves of stone there just by changing the angles
Bob Ross,"Just change the angles. There we go, little right there. Thatll turn out to be a big stone when were done. Now then, shoot, lets get crazy here"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a fan brush, gonna dip it into the liquid white, and well go here, go into titanium white. I put the liquid white on there only to thin the color"
Bob Ross,"Only to thin it, thats all, cause a thin paint will stick to a thick paint, but you cant reverse that easily, its a lot of trouble if you reverse it"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well put the least little touch of phthalo blue, and I mean least little touch, just enough to give it a hint of blue, all right. A lot of color in the brush. Lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Gotta make some big decisions. Maybe our water starts back here somewhere. We dont know where it comes from, phew, falls over. Then every time it falls, when it hits, theres gonna be a little splash"
Bob Ross,"There it goes. Now if you have trouble making this go over without it mixing with all your color, add a little more of the liquid white. Once again, that thin color will slide right over there"
Bob Ross,"Where do we want it to go. How many little waterfalls do you want in your world. And maybe, shoot, maybe some of em disappear there, come out around here, and drop over. Doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,You can create any illusion that you want on your canvas. Maybe they come way out here and drop. This water just bubbles through here. You can almost hear it
Bob Ross,Theres very few sounds in nature that are prettier than listening to water trickle over rocks and fall
Bob Ross,"I dream one day of having a home right beside a little bubbling steam like this where you can just set and listen to it all day or all night, whatever"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets go back, take our brush with our green on it, a little green, yellow, grab some of that ochre. Tap a little color into the bristle"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take a little of that green and push that right back. We want this to be higher than the water so it looks like its coming from behind it. There, see there. Isnt that something"
Bob Ross,"And the beauty of this, you could still turn this back into a happy little meadow, for example, if you wanted to. Its not too late. Its not too late"
Bob Ross,"You can just create all kinds of things yet with it. There we go. See, just layer after layer. Lets go on the other side and do a few little things over there, same basic idea, though"
Bob Ross,"See, just tap in all your little grassy areas wherever you want em. Maybe well make this one a little higher back here, there"
Bob Ross,"So it contains the water, we dont want the water slipping over the edges there and get the whole field wet out here. We dont want that. But maybe in your world you do want that"
Bob Ross,"If you do, its okay, you can do that. Lets put some. Lets put some happy little things here. Well just take some titanium white and just color on the canvas. Grab it and pull down"
Bob Ross,"Pull straight down and allow that color thats on the canvas to mix with your white. That creates all kinds of nice little effects, very nice"
Bob Ross,"And people who look at your painting, even if they dont understand, if they dont understand exactly whats wrong with it, their mind will tell em somethings not right in here, and it will disturb"
Bob Ross,"them. So try to keep these lines coming straight down. There we go, now then, we can have some little splashy, happy things that come out through here"
Bob Ross,"And some little shimmers across the water just by taking the brush. Shoot, whatever you want on there. Just drop em in, a few little splashes and foamy areas that are floating out through here"
Bob Ross,"Theres no limit to this, wherever you want it to go. Okay, tell you what, well take a little dark color here"
Bob Ross,"Let me take a little of that lavender that we mixed up, hows crimson, a little phthalo blue, tap a little into the brush. Now then, maybe theres a little peninsula that comes right out through here"
Bob Ross,"You know me, I like them old big trees, so maybe well put a big tree in here. We have to have a place for him to set, so were just putting some dark color in here so our light will show. Thats all"
Bob Ross,"And we can go back to our brush thats got the green on it and the yellow ochre, little touch of the bright red. Little indian yellow, all the reds, just tap it"
Bob Ross,"Now then, just come right on down here, but angles are very important, follow these angles that you put in here, see. Just let that work its way right on down. Right on down. There"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe, yeah, thats nice, I like that. Tell you what, maybe in our world there lives. We can have anything we want in our world. But maybe there lives a nice little bush right here"
Bob Ross,"We just take a one-inch brush, push in. Indication of a couple little bushes that live right in here, wherever you want em. Wherever you want em, doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"And Ill just take that and go right through some yellow. Because it has a little blue on it, well get a nice green color"
Bob Ross,"Little yellow ochre on it, okay, now, maybe well just put a beautiful little bush in right there. Leave some of these dark areas though, dont kill em all"
Bob Ross,"Thats what separates all your little bushes. Those little dark areas are your good friend. Ooh, theres a nice one, got a lot of yellow ochre in it. See, thats a happy accident"
Bob Ross,"Now then, tell you what, tell you what, we can take just our clean knife, and here and there, just scrape in an indication of a few sticks and twigs wherever you want em, let some of the black canvas"
Bob Ross,"show through, thats all were doing. But it helps create that illusion of distance and depth in your painting. Okay, lets have some fun. This is the moment of truth"
Bob Ross,"Lets bring a camera right up here, and lets pull the contact paper off. And well just zip that right off. like so, isnt that something. That is pretty, I like these kind of painting"
Bob Ross,"And you know me, shoot, theres a minute or two left here. Lets have us a happy tree. Well just take the knife, maybe, maybe well have an old birch tree that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"Lets just let it run all the way up here. Now you couldve left the birch tree inside of the oval, but I sorta like it when it sneaks out a little bit"
Bob Ross,"But when you do your painting, you make that decision. If you want him to live inside that oval, you put that rascal in there and keep him in there. There, this is just straight van dyke brown"
Bob Ross,"Just making a basic tree trunk. Now you could also do this just by taking the fan brush and making one stroke, and you can create a trunk in one stroke"
Bob Ross,"Just thought wed do it with a knife today, just a little different. There. Okay, that gives us a basic trunk"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take some titanium white, a little titanium white, pull it out as flat as you can get it, cut across, and we have our small roll of paint, see, right on the edge"
Bob Ross,"Heres our light, so maybe its gonna hit right here, and just sorta pull around a little. But when you do this, let me exaggerate, grab it and pull around, hope you can see that"
Bob Ross,"See there, and that gives a roundness to your tree. There we go. Wherever you want him to go, here he goes, bloop, bloop. Helps to make those little noises"
Bob Ross,"Of course people look at you a little strange, but thats all right, thats all right. Now then, well take some paint thinner, some paint thinner. A little bit of brown"
Bob Ross,"We want this to be very thin, though, ink consistency. Okay, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe theres a big old elm that lives right here, and you can let it come right on out of the oval if you want to, its okay. Its yours, you can do with it anything that you please"
Bob Ross,"Heres one, comes right up in the sky, maybe it comes right on in front. Maybe theres just a little shorty there, gotta have some of those, too. Wherever, wherever. See, there they go"
Bob Ross,"And right on up here. There, but just make all kinds of happy little tree limbs and things that make you happy. Now a few on this other one right over here. Like that"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, this little old trees coming right along here. This is a beautiful painting. I really hope you try it, you will find it works very well, its an easy little painting"
Bob Ross,"You can do it without any problem. Tell you what, lets sign that. Well take a little bit of red, come right in here, and well sign her, and with that, well call this one finished"
Bob Ross,"I hope youve enjoyed this. From all of us, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless"
Bob Ross,"light music - Voiceover This program is brought to you by North Light Books, publisher of over 200 how-to books and videos for fine artists and graphic designers"
Bob Ross,"And by Langnickel, manufacturers of selected artist brushes"
Bob Ross,"- Welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today. Its a fantastic day here, and I hope it is wherever you are"
Bob Ross,"So Ill tell you what, lets start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me at home"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, let me tell you what Ive already done here"
Bob Ross,"I have my standard ol 18 by 24-inch canvas, double primed, pre-stretched canvas, and Ive covered it with a thin, even coat of the liquid white, so its all wet and slick and ready to go so lets go"
Bob Ross,"I thought today wed just do a beautiful little painting, maybe well do something with fall colors. Its a good day so lets just, lets start out and do a very simple little sky"
Bob Ross,"Very simple, nondescript-type little sky. Well take a little bit of the yellow ochre on the 2-inch brush, very small amount"
Bob Ross,"Maybe just go up in here, and lets just begin blending in some nice warm little colors here"
Bob Ross,"This is just yellow ochre, but its mixing with the liquid white, and itll be very pale and very, very soft. There, maybe a touch more color right about in here, wherever, wherever. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, tell you what, tell you what lets take a little touch of the alizarin crimson on the 2-inch brush and some very small amount"
Bob Ross,Just pull a little bit out and tap the bristles firmly into the paint. That assures a nice even distribution of color all the way through the bristles
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then, maybe right in here well put a nice little warm spot, little pink spot just like that"
Bob Ross,"And were using little criss-cross strokes or little Xs like that and just blend that color right in. Once again, this is gonna be a very nondescript little sky very, very soft"
Bob Ross,You wont hardly even notice it when the paintings done. There. Now we just blend that crimson and ochre together. Lets have some fun
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, Ill take the knife and well mix up some lavender or purple color. Well take some alizarin crimson, a little bit of phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"Now, proportionately much, much more crimson than blue. The blue is many, many times stronger. Pick it up and turn it all the way over if you really wanna mix it well"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its very difficult to tell what color that is without putting a little white there because its gonna look just basically black, so put a little bit of white, and then you can test your"
Bob Ross,"color. Well put the small amount of that lavendar right here on the 2-inch brush, and maybe theres a little cloud that floats right in here. There, just tap. Its all we have to do"
Bob Ross,"Put in a very basic little idea of a cloud. Maybe right in here well put in a little little color like so, very soft and very gentle. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, with a clean brush were just gonna brush this, so I have several brushes going so I dont have to wash them between each procedure"
Bob Ross,"There we go and that easy we have a very nice, very effective, soft, little sky. Now then, Im gonna continue to use this 2-inch brush. Ill go right into that lavender color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well make some little background trees. Im just tapping the corner into the paint. I dont want a lot of paint on the bristles, just a little. Okay, lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, begin thinking about some very basic little tree shapes, and were not looking for a lot of detail here. This is too far away"
Bob Ross,"If you put too much detail, youll lose that illusion of distance, so be very careful, very careful. It starts working and it feels good and you wanna just, oh you get carried away, there"
Bob Ross,But we want this to be very soft and very distant. There we go
Bob Ross,"And think about little individual trees and bushes and all kinds of little shapes here and just sorta let your imagination take you wherever you wanna go. There, hmm"
Bob Ross,"That looks soft and far away already, and we havent hardly done a thing to it"
Bob Ross,"Now if you wanna create more mist at the base of this, well take a clean, dry brush and tap the bottom of these little bushes and trees but just the bottom, just the bottom"
Bob Ross,"And very lightly, two hairs and some air. Touch and lift upward. There we go. Now then, maybe we want to put several layers in there. Thats pretty easy to do also"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit more of the color on the 2-inch brush and tap firmly, tap firmly. There we are. Now then, we can begin putting in the next layer. Now this is a little bit darker"
Bob Ross,"Each layer, as it gets closer to you in a landscape, should get a little darker. There we go, maybe right here. Wherever you want, just drop them in. Okay, its fantastic already, I like that"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe back in here were beginning to see the first indication of a little bit of color but very small amount so Im going to do a little touch of the yellow ochre, maybe even pick up a little bit"
Bob Ross,"of bright red. Well have a fall scene today. That sounds good. Okay, now then, lets just begin. Youre still using just the top corner just tapping in the indication of a little bit of color"
Bob Ross,"Not too much or, once again, youll lose that illusion of distance and depth. There, just a few little indications. Maybe theres one right here or wherever. And I think today thats about all we need"
Bob Ross,"Now under here I must have a little grassy area, a little grassy area. So Ill just take a little bit more of that same lavender color"
Bob Ross,"Decide basically where your little grassy area is gonna live, and lets come right up in here, and all you have to do is just tap it in. And this is just the dark so our light color will show"
Bob Ross,"Its all were putting in right now. Doesnt matter how you put this in. You could put this in with a paint roller, doesnt matter. Any ol way you wanna do it. There"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, maybe down in here theres a little bit of water. You know me, I love water. And its so much fun to paint with this particular technique. Well take a little bit of the phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,Im still using the same ol dirty brush. There we go. And lets just come right across here. I dont want much water in this. Maybe just a happy little pond way back in the distance somewhere
Bob Ross,So Ill just take a little of the phthalo blue and come right across here like so
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we wanna reflect a little bit of that in there, so Ill take a little bit of the lavender color, same color, touch and just pull it down. Same lavender color, not a great deal"
Bob Ross,"Just enough to indicate a little reflection. Straight down, though. Its most important that these lines come straight down. If they go at an angle, its gonna bother the eye"
Bob Ross,"Itll drive you crazy and maybe you wont even know why. There. Now then, same ol brush. Still havent washed this ol brush. Well take a little yellow ochre, a little Indian yellow, cad yellow"
Bob Ross,Just mix them together. This is gonna be a fall picture. We want a lot of the nice pretty colors. Maybe even a little touch of the bright red here and there
Bob Ross,"But mix these colors on your brush, and that way you get a multitude of things happening on your brush rather than one ol dead color. Okay, lets try that. See what we have here"
Bob Ross,"Lets go right up here slightly above the dark area, and think about the lay of the land here, the way the land flows, and well just begin dropping in some happy little things"
Bob Ross,"There, all kinds of little happenings here. And this is far away, so were still not looking for a lot of detail. All were looking for is basic shape and color"
Bob Ross,"Alright, maybe theres a little land back here. Lets take a little bit of the Van Dyke brown, a little dark sienna mixed together with a knife. Pull it out as flat as we can get it"
Bob Ross,"Just really pull it out flat then cut across and get our little roll of paint. There, you can see it right on the edge of the knife"
Bob Ross,"Now then, up in here, up in here lets just scrub in a little bit of land area. Dont want a lot. Dont want a lot, just enough to give the indication of a little bank there or something. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, go into a little touch of the liquid white. Maybe add the least little touch of phthalo blue to it just to cool it down a little bit. There. Pull it out like that then cut across"
Bob Ross,Thats all there is to it. Now we go up here and act like youre trying to cut a hole right through the canvas. And well just cut in a little water line
Bob Ross,"There, its just a light area between these darks, and it sort of separates and makes things, just makes things look better. There. There might even be a little ripple or two out here. We dont know"
Bob Ross,"In your world, you make these decisions. You decide where all these things are. Okay, now its time to really get crazy. Lets take the ol big brush"
Bob Ross,"Well go right into that lavender color we made, and Ill add some Van Dyke brown to it. Shoot, maybe even some black. Make a good, strong, dark color. A lot of paint in the bristles"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets start deciding how our land is gonna flow here. Maybe its gonna come right about here. And all were doing here is just tapping in some color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres some bushes that live right there. Just push upward with the brush, and it makes all those little bushy effects. Let the brush work for you, shoot"
Bob Ross,"Maybe the land comes, maybe it comes right on up here. I dont know. Just make a decision in your world, and put it wherever you want it. There, maybe thats the way our land will be today"
Bob Ross,"Now we can just really just paint this in just like were painting a barn, shoot. Just wanna cover this with nice dark color. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"When youre using a big ol 2-inch brush, it doesnt take too long to do all this. You can just sorta throw it in. Okay. And maybe we want some trees in our world"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well have, maybe well have a lot of trees. But its up to you. When youre doing your painting, you sorta look around and decide what you want"
Bob Ross,"Cause you can create any kind of world that you want. Well just take the same ol brush, same ol brush. Well go through those same colors. Get some crimson. Maybe well add some sap green, too"
Bob Ross,"Thats a beautiful color. There, just pull it through in one direction. One direction. Now see that creates a curve on that brush. See that round curve on the top. We wanna keep that curve on the top"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up to the canvas. Now, maybe we can bring the camera in here real close, and when we touch, we wanna give it a little push. Give it a push. See that happening. See. Push"
Bob Ross,"And you can create, looky there. There it is. You can really see it now. But see that push. Thats what creates all those beautiful little leafy effects. Maybe theres a bush that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"Got a friend there. Wherever, wherever. Dont be afraid to experiment, though, when youre painting"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes you learn more from making mistakes than you learn from really trying to paint a beautiful masterpiece. Your mistakes can also, lets go up here, right up here"
Bob Ross,"Lets make one way up in the sky. There. Maybe theres a big tree that lives right up here. He looks around, and he watches the little pond here and all the little creatures that live around the pond"
Bob Ross,Cause you know thered be all kinds of little things around the watering hole there. Youd have ducks and squirrels
Bob Ross,"Hope you got to see my little squirrel I showed in one of the earlier shows of this series. Hes a character. Actually, its a she. Something else, though"
Bob Ross,"Maybe Ill, maybe Ill bring the squirrel back in one of the later shows and let you see her. There we go. And I have raised her since she was just a tiny little critter"
Bob Ross,"Didnt even have her eyes opened. There. See, and we have a great big tree now, that easy. Big ol tree. Im getting carried away, now lets have some, lets really have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Ill go back into all these dark colors, just pull them out here. Maybe theres a whole clump of trees lives right here. I dont know, wherever. But push that brush, bend it. Dont let it slide"
Bob Ross,"Look here, if it slides. See, thats what youre gonna get, and we dont want that. Look at the difference. See that nice open, leafy effect. Thats what were looking for"
Bob Ross,Thats whatll make your painting special. The only time we use a sliding effect that I can think of right now is when were making like saw grass that lives in the water. There
Bob Ross,"Sometimes were painting scenes from Florida, Louisiana, et cetera, you have that beautiful grass that grows in the water. And thats the way you make it. There"
Bob Ross,"You see, that easy you can block in a whole forest basically. And you begin seeing things, things. This is almost a natural place right here for a little path to live. Well think about that"
Bob Ross,"We may put a path in there. What the heck, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"You know, in this style of painting, you really dont have to make big decisions, and you look at your work, and you decide what do you see in there. And then you take that and work with it"
Bob Ross,And thats where you really have your fun. Thats where you really become creative. Lets take a fan brush here
Bob Ross,Im gonna take both sides through some brown and then take one side through titanium white. There we are. So we have white on one side and brown on the other. See there. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now then, we have to make a decision right now. Wheres our light coming from. If youre right handed, youll probably find that its easier to have the light coming from the right"
Bob Ross,So put the light side on the right side. Hard to say in one mouthful. And just pull down. And we can put a whole tree trunk in there in one stroke
Bob Ross,"Both sides, the highlight and the shadow, in one stroke. See there. Sneaky, huh. Maybe over here, maybe theres several trees over here. So you decide how many trees live in your clump or group"
Bob Ross,"You decide. And maybe you cant see the entire trunk of all of them. Maybe you can only see that much of that one cause maybe theres a big bush here, I dont know. Just use your imagination"
Bob Ross,"But you dont want every one of them to be exactly the same. You dont want each one of them to be perfectly straight. It becomes very boring very quickly. Maybe, maybe theres a limb here on this one"
Bob Ross,"See. Just whatever you want, though. Maybe over here you can see a little teeny one. Gotta have small trees or youll never have any big ones. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, today lets use a, lets use a 1-inch brush, and Im gonna dip it into a little bit a little bit of the liquid white and then well go through color. Well start with yellow"
Bob Ross,"Ill reach up here and get a little bit of black. Tell ya what, a little red. We just, this is gonna be a fall scene. We need a lot of beautiful colors. Theres some yellow ochre, shew"
Bob Ross,"Put your sunglasses on, this ones gonna be a bright one. But pull this brush in one direction like that. And once again, see the rounded corner. Thats what were looking for"
Bob Ross,"Put that rounded corner to the top. Lets go right here. Go slightly above the dark, and very gently, very gently, begin laying in your shape of your tree. Now remember this tree is not flat"
Bob Ross,It has roundness this way as well as this way. So think about shape and form when youre building your tree
Bob Ross,"Dont just throw a bunch of color on it cause the ol tree will come out looking flat as a board. Give him some character. Let each tree be an individual, there. Theyre like people"
Bob Ross,"They wanna be, they wanna be individuals. Now sometimes when you have fall scenes, maybe Jack Frost doesnt get all of it and theres still a little green here and there. Some plants never turn colors"
Bob Ross,So lets have one of those right here. Just a nice one that has a little green in it. And maybe hes got a little friend that lives here behind this bush. We dont know
Bob Ross,"But once again, and I know you get tired of hearing it all the time, do one bush at a time. Dont be in too big a hurry. Im gonna leave some of these dark things sticking up back here"
Bob Ross,"Theyll be, theyll be nice. And Ill go into my yellow ochre, a little bit of cad yellow. Lets go up here to this tree. And maybe up here in this tree maybe, maybe, yep"
Bob Ross,"Theres some beautiful colors up in in here, too. But once again, think about shape in this tree. So, so important. There. Think about form. There, right across the trunk"
Bob Ross,"Cause you dont see the entire trunk in a tree normally. In nature, theres just about exceptions to every rule, but normally you wont see the entire trunk. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back here theres even a little, we dont know. Lets have some, lets have a firecracker there. Shoot, let me go into a little bit of alizarin crimson and then the yellow"
Bob Ross,"Alizarin crimson and then some cad yellow. We gonna make a, we gonna make a firecracker right there. Thatll be pretty. There, pull the brush in that one direction, though"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe right in here lives, ooh thats nice. That is nice. There, there he is. He just hangs out here around the pond. There. Maybe even a little bright red down here"
Bob Ross,"Mmm, beautiful little bush. Okay, theres a little bit over in here. There he is. Practice some with this brush, though"
Bob Ross,"Youll be surprised, probably be amazed at what you can do with a brush like this. Im gonna go into a little more of the liquid white"
Bob Ross,"If you have trouble making your colors stick, add a little bit liquid white or a little bit of paint thinner but a very small amount of paint thinner"
Bob Ross,The liquid white now will change your color a little bit. Make it brighter. Okay. See. Just have a little bit of green there and well go right here
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a happy little bush that lives right there. Vary these colors, though. In the fall you have every color that you can imagine. There"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, while we have that green, maybe over here theres a nice little bush that lives right there. There we go. But you can begin creating all kinds of effects"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, tell you what, lets go back into our yellow ochre, maybe Ill grab some bright red. Whoo, thats a pretty one. Thats a pretty one. Alright. Lets go right up in here"
Bob Ross,Now sometimes these big trees have a tendency to scare you. But just remember that large trees are nothing more than clumps of bushes put together
Bob Ross,"Its just a whole group of little small bushes that got together and made a big tree. And work on individual shapes inside of this tree. Think of each limb, for example, is just a bush"
Bob Ross,Just a little bush thats sticking out there. And dont be afraid to reload the brush often
Bob Ross,Probably the biggest mistake made is not thinning the paint enough and not putting enough paint on the bristles. There we go
Bob Ross,"And if you dont have enough paint, then you have to hit very hard, and itll, itll just sorta moosh together. There we go"
Bob Ross,See how you can create all those different effects just using an ol 1-inch brush. There. And leave some areas open so you have some of these dark things showing through
Bob Ross,"Let a little trunk show through here and there. All these things are, theyre what make your painting interesting. Make it stand out. There, another little bush down here"
Bob Ross,"Another thing that would help your painting be special, any time you have a large clump of trees like this, this area right in here, you need a dark shadow area, very dark shadow area"
Bob Ross,"Tell ya what, lets go in here. Lets go in here. Take that ol 2-inch brush, tap in a little color, and lets just begin laying in the lay of the land here"
Bob Ross,"Little grassy areas, soft little areas like that. Very soft. Bring this all together. There. We said we might have a little path in here. I think thats an excellent idea"
Bob Ross,"Well put in a little bit of these grassy areas. Im just gonna drop in a little path. Now see by changing the angle here, changing the angle we can create different plains. There we go. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"But just by tapping you can create all of these little illusions of all these things that are happening, and by changing the color a little bit, changing the intensity or the brightness of the color,"
Bob Ross,you can create different plains in your painting. Lets take a fan brush
Bob Ross,"Well put a little bit of little bit of brown on it, little Van Dyke, little dark sienna, and lets just begin creating the illusion of a little path. Look at that, there it comes. There it comes"
Bob Ross,"And that way you clean up the bottom of all these little things, make them any way you want them. Add a little white to the brush. Then you can come back in here. There"
Bob Ross,I like to do this with sort of a rocking motion cause it makes it look like the path is sort of worn there in the center. There we go. Alright
Bob Ross,"Now then we can come back, add a few little finishing touches wherever we want them. Maybe right in here theres another little bush"
Bob Ross,"And you can take this brush sideways, push upward and itll create all kinds of little grassy-looking things, little bushes that live right in here. Well have them work right down the side like so"
Bob Ross,"And bring all this together. Alright, hmm"
Bob Ross,"Now then, with just a clean knife, all Im gonna do is just go in here and scrape in the indication of a few little sticks and twigs and all these little happy things"
Bob Ross,But these also help create that illusion of depth and distance in your painting. There
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we can take our liner brush and go into a little bit of the brown, but we want this paint to be thin like ink. And lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe there lives some little sticks and twigs and just little extra things all over here like that. Okay, tell ya what. Think this ones about finished. Lets take a little of the red"
Bob Ross,"Lets come right in here, and well sign this one. Certainly hope youve enjoyed it. Its a very nice little painting, and I think youll enjoy doing this one"
Bob Ross,"And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. Interlude"
Bob Ross,"Thats still the number one most requested thing that I get letters about is people wanting to do mountains and the fact that theyre having some problems with them, so I thought wed devote this show"
Bob Ross,to some beautiful mountains and well work on those. So lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me
Bob Ross,"As theyre doing that, lets go on up here and let me tell you what Ive done. Have my standard old 18-by-24-inch canvas up here"
Bob Ross,"Its been covered with a nice, thin, even coat of liquid white and its all ready to go"
Bob Ross,"So, lets just do a quick little happy sky here and then well spend most of our time working on mountains today. Ima start with a little touch of the phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"Well use the old two-inch brush and just pull it through a little of the color like so and tap. That gets a nice, even distribution of color all the way through the bristles"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets go up here and well start right at the top, making our little crisscross strokes, little Xs"
Bob Ross,"But start at the top, work all the way across and then go downward, then automatically, automatically, your color will get lighter and lighter toward the horizon"
Bob Ross,"And thats exactly what were looking for in a landscape. Kay, and you can always make it a little darker, if you want it a little darker you can add a little more blue"
Bob Ross,But Id suggest you start at the top and work downward. There we go. Kay
Bob Ross,"But by using these little crisscross strokes, your color will blend together much better than if you just come across like that"
Bob Ross,"And you get little things happening up here, its not just a flat old dead sky. There. Kay, and maybe well have a little water underneath our mountains, I love water. I think its so pretty"
Bob Ross,"And in this technique its one of the nicest things to paint. So without cleaning the brush, well go right into the phthalo blue. And Ill reach over here and get a small amount of the phthalo green"
Bob Ross,"The phthalo green is very strong, be careful with it. Eat up your whole world in just a heartbeat. Kay, now then, lets have a little water here"
Bob Ross,"Now, to make water, if its still water, then its gonna be level. So pull from the outside in. And try to keep these strokes as straight as you can. There. OK, a little more of the paint"
Bob Ross,"Well go on the other side, do the same thing, but Im pulling from the outside in. Outside in. And then I wanna leave a little area here in the center"
Bob Ross,"If everything works just right, when were finished thatll look like a little sheen of light coming across here"
Bob Ross,"But by starting at the bottom and working upward, this should be a little darker than here. Everything in a landscape toward the horizon should be lighter in value. Lets wash our old brush off"
Bob Ross,"And as you know, we wash our brushes with odorless paint thinner. smacking sound chuckles I just beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,"Now, with a clean, dry brush, you can just very gently go all the way across this and bring it all together. That light area still remains in here"
Bob Ross,"But you can pull it and move it any way that you wanted, because the canvas is wet with the liquid white, you can move color. Now then. All right, that gives us a nice, nice little sky and water area"
Bob Ross,"And today, as I mentioned earlier, were gonna spend most of this show working on mountains, so Im not gonna even put any clouds in the sky today"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little black, midnight black, a little bit of the Prussian blue, and some Alizarin crimson. Maybe even a little Van Dyke brown. There we go, something like so"
Bob Ross,"Pull the paint out as flat as you can get it, get tough with it, and go straight down, cut off our little roll of paint, so you have a little roll of paint that lays right out on the edge of the"
Bob Ross,"knife, thats most important. Lets go up here. Now then, first major decision we have to make in this painting is where is our mountains gonna live"
Bob Ross,"Since were gonna devote a lot of time to mountains, lets put several different mountains in here. And all were worried about when we first start is this nice top edge"
Bob Ross,We could care less whats happening in here. All were looking for is this edge. And you can probably hear how hard Im scraping the canvas. You wanna remove all the excess paint
Bob Ross,"Theres actually very little paint on the canvas. Very little paint. Dont be afraid to scrape it hard, youre not gonna hurt this canvas, its tough"
Bob Ross,"And shoot, who knows, maybe this comes over, maybe theres a big mountain up here. Thatll give us a lot of practice space. Maybe theres another bump there, I dont know, wherever you want em"
Bob Ross,"When youre doing mountains, just sorta, just sorta make em up in your mind. The one thing that I would suggest, dont make just a bunch of tepees like that. It ends up looking like wigwam village"
Bob Ross,"The other thing that I would recommend, if this is your first time doing mountains or youre just starting to paint with us, I would strongly suggest that you make your initial mountains with just a"
Bob Ross,"few peaks on em. Its very easy to jump in here and make about 40 little peaks, but each one of those peaks has to have highlight and it has to have shadow on it"
Bob Ross,"So start off simple and as you learn and you become familiar with the equipment, then you can get more and more difficult with what youre doing"
Bob Ross,"Now then, with a large brush, Im just gonna pull this color. Once again, because its wet, you can move color. If this was a dry canvas, youd be in agony city when you try to do this"
Bob Ross,"But you can literally move color, and when youre painting mountains, mountains should always be more distinct on the top than they are on the bottom"
Bob Ross,"And by doing this blending, it does two things, it creates that illusion that its lighter down here than up here, plus it removes excess paint"
Bob Ross,"So youre next layer, or your highlights, will stick much, much easier. There. For years Annette and I taught classes all over the country and this was always the most popular thing for people to do"
Bob Ross,And we liked it because it teaches people to use the old palette knife here. And I want you to make friends with this knife. Its unreal what you can do with it
Bob Ross,"I remember one of the earlier series, we painted an entire scene, the entire painting, using only the knife. And thats how versatile it is if youll just give it a chance"
Bob Ross,"Lets highlight this with just titanium white today. Pull it out very flat, flat as you can get it. And cut across, once again we need that little roll of paint. Lets do that again so you can see it"
Bob Ross,"Flat, then just cut across. Little roll of paint, right out on the edge of the knife. Its very important. Now then, lets make a decision, wheres your light source"
Bob Ross,"Normally, if youre right-handed, its easier to have the light coming from the right"
Bob Ross,"If youre left-handed, it will vary because left-handed people have been forced to do right-handed things their entire life, so it will vary"
Bob Ross,"If youre left-handed, try it both ways and see which way works well for you. Now then, lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Take the point of the knife, put it right up here at the point of this mountain and just come right down, following the angles in the mountain, applying no pressure. Absolutely no pressure at all"
Bob Ross,"No pressure. If you apply a lot of pressure, youre gonna end up with paint here that looks like youve iced a cake"
Bob Ross,"And you can put shape in here, change things, move em, anything that you want, you can do here. Lets put in some highlights, then well come back and do some shadows, maybe well go over here"
Bob Ross,"Lets put a few highlights right here on this great big old mountain. Follow the angles, though. Follow the angles that youve put in here. There we go, see. Those angles are very, very important"
Bob Ross,"Very important. Theyre your best friend when youre doing mountains. The little peak here, maybe theres a little light that just bounces right up here, zing, that has fun"
Bob Ross,"Maybe for practice purposes, lets just bring this all the way down"
Bob Ross,"Now, when I was first learning this, what I would do was get a huge canvas, maybe 30-by-40 inches, and start at the top and paint mountains all the way down to the bottom"
Bob Ross,"And when I got to the bottom, I had a big putty knife, it was about six inches across, take the putty knife and go whhhhttt. Zip it all off"
Bob Ross,"I know it sounds horrible, but thats the best way to learn is by repetition, doing things over and over. So, devote a little time to practicing like that, it will pay you tremendous dividends"
Bob Ross,"OK, lets take a little, well just use a little blue, little phthalo blue and white, thats fine for today. You can very these colors any way you want them to make mountains the way that you see them"
Bob Ross,"Our little roll of paint, once again. Now then, you notice all these angles of highlight color going basically the same angle. Now, all of the shadows will go in the opposing or the opposite"
Bob Ross,"See, just follow right down. Youre still following the basic angles. No pressure, you want that paint to break. Let it break. Now, this is one of the simplest types of mountains there is to make"
Bob Ross,"If this is your first painting or two, I would suggest you do these type of mountains to become familiar with the equipment and what happens in the paints"
Bob Ross,"And, as we mentioned earlier, once you become confident with this, then you can begin making all kinds of beautiful, beautiful mountains. There. See, just sorta let these blend together"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, watch right here, this is neat. You have to make big decisions. Is this peak on this side or on the back side. Lets put it on the back side. To do that, put that shadow in first, like so"
Bob Ross,"Now, this shadow, you wanna bring distinctly through it. Here it comes, here it comes. Look at that, see how it pushed that one right back. You didnt know you had such power, did you"
Bob Ross,"You can move mountains, you really can move mountains. At least on this canvas. On canvas, you can do anything that you wanna do. And you can do it"
Bob Ross,"Kay, now, this one over here, same thing, it needs a shadow. Every highlight needs its own private shadow. There we go. Now, sometimes its fun to make like little areas in here"
Bob Ross,"Little recessed areas. All you have to do is put a shadow in. And they just, watch, if you want one right here, just put a shadow"
Bob Ross,"But notice the angles, all the angles of the shadows are basically the same direction. All the angles of the highlight are basically the same"
Bob Ross,"Cause lights only gonna strike at a given angle when it comes through here. Now, maybe in your world, you decide, hey, I think there should be a peak right here. Watch here. Watch here. See here"
Bob Ross,"No pressure, though, on the knife. This breaking, or the holes left in here, are what really, really create beautiful effects. Look at that. See. Let it float through there"
Bob Ross,"And you can make it wider, any way that you want it. But now, see what it looks like. It doesnt look right until you come back up here and add this shadow in. Look at the difference"
Bob Ross,"Look at the difference, just by putting that little shadow in. And you can carry this on through the whole canvas and make just all kinds of little things"
Bob Ross,"Now, maybe well strengthen this line here and thatll pull it in front. There. And pay attention to whats happening, sometimes a beautiful thing will happen"
Bob Ross,"When that happens, try to remember how you did it. And the next time that you want that effect, then youll know how to do it. There we go. See there"
Bob Ross,"But you can create all kinds of little valleys and hills and youre never limited, you can continually change these. You can add to em or subtract. Anything that you wanna do"
Bob Ross,"Cause if youve painted with me before you know we dont make mistakes, we have happy accidents"
Bob Ross,"You learn to work with everything that happens and thats when you get over any fear of painting and it really becomes fun. Now then, we wanna create the illusion of mist down here at the base"
Bob Ross,"So we take a clean, dry two-inch brush and we just tap. But pay very close attention to angles. If this comes in this angle, you dont wanna tap it like that. Follow the angles"
Bob Ross,"I know that sounds sorta silly to say, but sometimes we get carried away and we just go across the bottom and hit like that and it looks like somebody took a big ax and whacked the bottom of it off"
Bob Ross,"Follow the angles. Over on this side, you go in this direction. See. Wherever they go. Like here, you could blend these two together a little bit, but the angles are very important"
Bob Ross,"Just softly bring em together. Now lift upward, once again following the angles. That removes all the little tap marks, brings everything together. There"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that a fantastic way, though, to make some very effective little mountains. And itll work for you. It will work for you. There we go. Now lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets do, lets take, well just use that old mountain color that we had and add some sap green to it. Just whatever, were just looking basically for a dark color"
Bob Ross,"Well put a little bit of white in it. There we go, just to sparkle it up some. A little bit of white. There. Dont over-mix your color, look at all the different things that are happening in there"
Bob Ross,"Let me wipe my knife off. There. Now then, we can just use the old two-inch brush, it doesnt matter. Just tap a little of that right in there"
Bob Ross,"See, just get a little color right on that two-inch brush. And well make some little footie hills that live way back here. There"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe in our world, maybe theres a little area back in here where theres all kinds of little trees growing down at the base of these big mountains"
Bob Ross,"And we dont know where they go, dont know that we care. Just wanna put all these little shapes in here. There. And you can do this with a fan brush, one-inch brush, any old thing"
Bob Ross,"All were doing, though, is using just the corner"
Bob Ross,"Now, another little thing thats fun, if you wanna make it look like little trees back here, Ill just use the one-inch brush today cause I picked that up, two-inchll work just as well, lift gently"
Bob Ross,"Just the other day there was a letter in our newsletter, somebody had written, saying they were having problems with this, and usually the problem comes from making big strokes, you go from bottom all"
Bob Ross,"the way up. Make tiny little strokes and work in layers. OK, now then, lets go back, same old brush, and lets come right in here and drop in a little thing that lives right there. Like so. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe it comes right on up here. There we go. OK, maybe it comes right over here. Like so. Wherever you want em, just let em go"
Bob Ross,"But you can make layer after layer after layer of these little foothills. The only thing, that little misty area is all that separates em"
Bob Ross,"So its very important, dont let that little misty area get away from ya. There we go. Now, while we have that color on the brush, maybe theres some reflections into the water here"
Bob Ross,"And all we gotta do is touch and pull down. Just touch it and pull down. See there. There. Now, let me find a relatively clean brush here. Pull it down"
Bob Ross,"Now then, its important that these come straight down. Now well go across. And you can moves those. You can push em. Cause the canvas is wet, you can move this anywhere you want it to go"
Bob Ross,"And you can make those little lines wiggle and jiggle. And it gives the feeling of water, that easy. Maybe one of the nicest things that happened in this technique is making reflections"
Bob Ross,"When I was a traditional painter, reflections used to drive me crazy"
Bob Ross,I can remember even taking and turning the canvas upside down and repainting the picture over and then try to make it go wiggle-wiggle and all that and tshhh
Bob Ross,"Take a little bit of the liquid white, a little touch of titanium white, I put the liquid white in there only to thin the titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Now, Ill be right back, get a little touch of the brown, little touch of dark sienna. Now, this paint is thinner than what we would normally use, so itll slide on easier"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna get a tiny little roll of paint, right on the edge"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets go up in here and put the indication, and Im scrubbing quite hard, the indication here of a little sand, little sand bars and all that that happen, right here at the waters edge"
Bob Ross,"There we go. But you can probably hear how hard Im scrubbing. Really get in there and work on it. See, maybe theres a little recessed are in there. That sorta happens. There it comes, see it"
Bob Ross,"Now, thats where that big trout lives, right up in there. So when youre out in your canoe fishing, this is where you wanna go. I love to fish. Love to fish. Im not a very good fisherman, though"
Bob Ross,"I catch one and I put a Band-Aid on his lip and give him a little CPR and pat him on the tutu, put him back in the water. Hope I can catch him again some other day"
Bob Ross,"OK, that gives us a nice mountain and a little background area, very easily. I hope this has really helped you with mountains if youre having any problems with em"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets just put something down here to finish up the painting. Doesnt really matter. Clean off my palette"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some black, Prussian blue, a little of the sap green, crimson, any old dark color you got, any old dark color. Mix em up a little bit, let me clean off my knife here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, today, Ill tell you what, let me find a fan brush here thats clean. There. Lets use the old fan brush. Put a lot of color on, lot of color. Kay, lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, the first big decision we have to make, if were gonna have a tree, for example, here is wheres that tree gonna live. Lets put him right about there. Start off with just a little line"
Bob Ross,"And normally when were making these trees, we push downward with the fan brush so it has little hangy-downs all underneath it"
Bob Ross,I think today what Ill do is maybe make a different kind of tree and well push it upward and see how that works. Kay. Come right up here. Give it a little upward push. Like so
Bob Ross,"See, push, and the farther down the tree you work, Im still using the corner of the brush, I just push harder and harder so that the bristles spread out more and more and automatically your tree will"
Bob Ross,"get bigger down toward the base. There we go. Super nice easy way of making a little tree. Now then, lets go on the other side of the canvas over here, we dont want it left out"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a tree that lives over here. Same thing, give it a little upward push. And maybe where you live, you want evergreen trees that have limbs that hang down. All you do is reverse the brush"
Bob Ross,"Push it downward, any way that you wanna make em. Its completely and totally up to you. There we go. All right, well just keep on going here. And you can make this tree as big as you want it"
Bob Ross,"These are also very nice to make with a one or two-inch brush. Works just as well, not quite as much detail, but still works"
Bob Ross,"Now, sometimes when youre going over a lot of thick, white paint like this, its very difficult to get the paint to stick"
Bob Ross,"If that should happen, we didnt have any problems this time, but if it should happen, add a little bit, little bit of paint thinner to your paint"
Bob Ross,"And thatll thin it down enough that itll stick right in there. There we go, while we got that old brush going, Ill just go right through a little bit of cad yellow"
Bob Ross,"And since theres blue in that color, automatically, well get a beautiful green. Maybe we can come back here and just highlight these trees a little. Dont overdo. Evergreens are normally quite dark"
Bob Ross,"Quite dark. And you can kill that beautiful darkness real easy. Lets go back on the other side, get that one while were working. There we are. OK"
Bob Ross,"See, and that makes all those little limbs and things that are so pretty in a painting. OK. Lets get old two-inch brush, well go right into that dark color"
Bob Ross,"Now, under this tree we have a nice collection of bushes. There they are. Just drop em in. Just drop em in. See. Push upward with this brush, though, to make all those things just happen. There"
Bob Ross,"And all were doing is just filling this in, you could do this with your shoe, it doesnt matter. Whatever. Were just filling in a lot of area very quickly and a big old brush works very nice"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take, well use the old one-inch brush today and dip it into a little of the liquid white, lets go through some of the cad yellow. Now, maybe you wanna show a spring"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little of the phthalo green and mix it right in there. Lot of paint on the bristles, though, kay. Now then, spring is usually brighter, cheerier"
Bob Ross,"The phthalo green will make a very bright, shiny green. Whew. Hurt your eyes if youre not careful. There we go. And work in layers, do one bush at a time, dont get in too big a hurry. There we are"
Bob Ross,"See how you can just make layer after layer, though, using just one color. And I will warn you, though, using one color is much more difficult than using a lot of colors"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its easier to use quite a few colors, and that way color separates as well as differences in values or intensity or dark against light. There"
Bob Ross,"Kay, maybe theres a happy little bush right there. And you can just bring all these together, it doesnt much matter. The big thing was we wanted to work on some beautiful little mountains today"
Bob Ross,"Show you how to do those. As I say, that still is the number one thing that we get requests for. Its also the number one thing that I hear that people are having problems with"
Bob Ross,"So I hope this has really helped you, if you are having problems. And chances are maybe youre not having the problem. But if you are, I hope this helps eliminate it"
Bob Ross,Here were just using the side of the brush and dropping in some little bushy areas. That easy. Maybe one right here
Bob Ross,"And we can take a clean knife, just go around, scrape in a few little sticks, little twigs, happy little things like that. Shoot, you about have a finished painting. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"And I really hope, once again, if you are having any problems with mountains, this has helped cure your problems. Let me hear from ya, drop me a line sometime. Were gonna call this one finished"
Bob Ross,"From all of us, happy painting, and God bless, my friend. happy little music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today, cause today, I thought wed do just a happy little painting"
Bob Ross,"In fact, I thought today wed do the little painting that you see at the opening of each show of this series. The little soft painting that has all the little yellows in it"
Bob Ross,"Ill show you exactly how that one was made. It may not be an exact duplicate of the one that we show, but itll be close enough that youll know exactly how to do your own at home"
Bob Ross,"So, I tell you what. Let me show you what Ive done up here. Ive got my standard ol 18 x 24 inch canvas, but Ive taken Black Gesso and Ive painted this whole area around here"
Bob Ross,"Sorta looks like a big wave. And allowed the Black Gesso to dry completely. Then on top of that, weve put transparent color, or semi-transparent, its transparent enough for what were doing"
Bob Ross,"I started here and theres several colors, so Ill go through em. With Indian Yellow, right about here. And just let it blend back"
Bob Ross,"Then Ive added a little bit of Dark Sienna, mixed with a little Alizarin Crimson, and Ive just blended that back. Then on the edges, weve put a little Van Dyke Brown so itll be very dark"
Bob Ross,"So, I tell you what. Lets start out, have em run all the colors across the screen, that you need to paint this little picture. While theyre doing that, shoot, lets go on up here and get started"
Bob Ross,"Today, lets start with a small amount of Yellow Ochre. Just a little Yellow Ochre. Lets go right up here in the light area and begin putting in some color"
Bob Ross,"All were gonna do is take this Yellow Ochre, and just put it right in here. Beautiful color, its a nice golden color. And its mixing with the liquid white thats on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"This little white area here has Liquid White on it. Itll mix with that and itll blend into some beautiful, beautiful colors"
Bob Ross,"Then without cleaning the brush, Im gonna pick up the least little amount of Alizarin Crimson, and just apply it. Least little amount though. I dont want this to get very bright"
Bob Ross,"Want this to stay very soft and very muted. brush sweeping across canvas There, but I want it to get a little darker. This is going to be our light source in here"
Bob Ross,"This Black Gesso does some of the most fantastic things. Its a wonderful, wonderful thing to play with. There we go, now then. Still without cleaning the brush, take a little bit of the Dark Sienna"
Bob Ross,"Little Dark Sienna, its a very warm brownish color. And just blend that right in, like so. That gives us our color that we want. Now then, I wanna create that very bright effect"
Bob Ross,"So let me take another brush. I have several brushes going, so I dont have to spend all my time washing em. Even though that is the fun part"
Bob Ross,"Right into Titanium White, here with the old two-inch brush. Im loading quite a bit of the color on there. Okay, lets go back up here"
Bob Ross,"Now if our light source is going to be in here, start right up against that dark area. Begin blending that outward. Thats going to mix with all the colors that you have"
Bob Ross,"Itll create a very light area. It may not look as light now, as it will when were finished. Because well put all kinds of things in there. Now you can do this as many times as you want"
Bob Ross,"To achieve a desired lightness. But each time, I recommend that you wash your brush, clean it, dry it. Start with a nice fresh brush and fresh color back up in the light area"
Bob Ross,brush thwacking Bob snickering And that is the fun part of this. Get a little bit more of the Titanium White. Lets go right back up here. Just blend that right in
Bob Ross,"As I say, you can do this, three, four times, if you wanted to. Each time though, Id really recommend you clean the brush"
Bob Ross,"You dont, youre gonna take that contaminated, dirty color, dark color, back into this light area. Youll lose this beautiful glow. Okay, now then, just very lightly. Just sort of pull that out"
Bob Ross,"There. Now, when were done, thats going to be very bright. Very bright and very effective. paint thinner splashing brush slapping and thwacking There we are. We just beat that ol brush to death"
Bob Ross,"Good way of taking out all your frustrations and hostilities and all that. Now then, lets take a little. Well just mix these on the brush"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little Titanium White, little bit of the Dark Sienna. Wanna keep this color quite subdued. Little bit of Alizarin Crimson into it, but I dont want this to get very dark. There, all right"
Bob Ross,"We have color in the brush. Lets go right up here. Now then, lets start making the indication of all kinds of little bushes that live back in here"
Bob Ross,"Now, I want this color to be so close to whats up there that you almost cant see it. This will make all the things that are so far away. All were using is the corner of the brush, pushing upward"
Bob Ross,Just push upward. There. I like these very soft little paintings. I hope you can see that there is something there. This first layer we want to be very subdued though
Bob Ross,"As we put more layers in there, then we can get a little darker with it. All were doing is just pushing in some basic little shapes though. Okay, now then"
Bob Ross,"Add a little more of the Dark Sienna to the same color. Just white, a little Dark Sienna, little touch of Alizarin Crimson. There, now its gettin a little darker"
Bob Ross,"Little darker, and we can put in another layer. This one will show up even more. You can put as many layers of these little bushes in here that you want. There we go"
Bob Ross,"See there, maybe theres a nice little thing that lives right there. Let your imagination go. Just make all kinds of little things. There. Heres one over here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well add a little bit more of the dark color to that, so it stands out a little more. There. See there. Just use a corner of the brush and just sort of rub these on"
Bob Ross,"In that upstroke, youre pushing outward. Thats where you get the nice little edges. But you can create the illusion of a lot of little bushes and trees back here. Just by doing that"
Bob Ross,"Many or as few as you want. Maybe right here, maybe theres one that lives there. We dont know, shoot, maybe it goes all the way up in here"
Bob Ross,"As I mentioned earlier, this will not be an exact duplicate of what you see at the beginning of the show, but it will certainly give you an idea of how it was made"
Bob Ross,"brush scrubbing canvas There we are. Now then, Im gonna darken that color a little bit more, Dark Sienna, white. You can even add a little bit of Van Dyke Brown, here and there"
Bob Ross,If you want it to get dark. Dont let it get too dark too quick. Im gonna put the indication of another bush that lives right here. There
Bob Ross,"And you can come right over the Black Gesso, because this white here is opaque. Itll cover right over that dark"
Bob Ross,"You can just make layer after layer, after layer of all kinds of just happy little things. Its a super way to make little scenes that look like theyre deep in the woods. There. Now then, lets take"
Bob Ross,"Add a little more white to that same color. I wanna lighten it back up again. There we go, get a little touch of the crimson in there. Lot of color on the brush though. There. Maybe back in here"
Bob Ross,"Lets come right in here. Maybe there lives, in our world, a happy little tree. Right there. makes light zooming sound There he his, make him a little bit stronger. Well give him a little friend"
Bob Ross,"Everybody needs a friend. There. brush tapping palette Shoot, maybe hes got two friends. Maybe hes real popular. Well take our liner brush, little paint thinner on it"
Bob Ross,"Well go right into the same color again. Want this paint though to be very thin. Then you can go up here. Well put the indication here and there. Few little limbs and branches, sticks, twigs"
Bob Ross,"Whatever you want to call em. All kinda little things. If you have trouble making your paint flow, add more paint thinner. Its just too thick, thats the only thing thats wrong with it"
Bob Ross,"Just add a little more thinner. Now, while we have that going, maybe here and there we can see the indication of some little things that are"
Bob Ross,"Little stems that are in some of these bushes that are far back here. But were not looking for a lot of detail. Were gonna lose this illusion of soft, misty, distant area. All right"
Bob Ross,"splashing brush in paint thinner Well just go back to our old two-inch brush here. Well go right into that same color. Ill just tap it, firmly tap it"
Bob Ross,brush tapping palette Load a little color on it. Lets go back up here. Maybe theres indication of some nice little leaves here. Were just using the corner of the two-inch brush
Bob Ross,"We can just begin putting in all kinds of little things. These are sorta just like little silhouettes, way back in the distance. Not very strong, not very bright, at this point"
Bob Ross,"Well get brighter and darker as we move forward. But back here, we just want little silhouettes. Really all were looking for. There. Same old colors, the browns and the crimson and white"
Bob Ross,"Just mix em up real good here. Now then, maybe a little bit darker, so it stands out against that. There, beautiful, just right. Just right. Tastes good. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Were beginning to get many layers in here. That quickly though, it looks likes theres just tremendous depth in there. Only because youre playing with color and that little misty area in between"
Bob Ross,"Thats all you have to do to create that illusion of distance and mist. There we go. Now, go back to my old two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Now we can start working forward and getting some of these big trees that hang over. Well take some Dark Sienna, Van Dyke Brown, a little crimson, same ol colors. Shoot, doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Maybe even a little bit of the Midnight Black. Were getting quite dark now though. Push that brush into the paint. See, push. That creates that little ridge right out on the end of the bristles"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets go right up in here. And begin thinking about shape and form of your big trees that are hanging over here. brush tapping canvas There. Look at that"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that fantastic, that you can do that with a big ol two-inch brush. You can. You really can. All those things, just sort of happen here. Looks like a lot of trees and stuff already"
Bob Ross,"brush tapping canvas Maybe down in here, some bushes. They live right along in here. Well make a few little individual things. Wherever you want em"
Bob Ross,"Now, because we have this Black Gesso and all this under color, a lot of this is gonna happen automatically for you. You dont have to spend a great deal of time working and worrying"
Bob Ross,"Allow it to happen on the canvas. There. Now, use the same old brush. Im gonna go right into a little bit of the Cad Yellow, the Yellow Ochre. Load it the same way"
Bob Ross,"I left that dark color on the brush, so it will mix with this and youll get a much nicer color. All right, lets go back up here. Now we can come back in here and lets highlight some of these"
Bob Ross,"There, dont wanna put too much highlight on here or well lose that beautiful darkness. If you lose the darkness, then this light area back here is not near as effective"
Bob Ross,"Thats what makes this painting sing. Is those beautiful dark areas. In that contrasting light, it looks like theres a sun beam back here, just playing. There we go. Think about shape and form"
Bob Ross,Dont just throw these on. Each ones an individual. Each ones your friend. Treat it well. Treat it good. But you can put as many or as few little things as you want here
Bob Ross,"If youre out demonstrating for people, this is one of those paintings that if people are watching you paint it publicly, or if youre just painting for a group of friends, theyll be so excited by"
Bob Ross,the time youre done. Theyll be lookin for their paintbrush. There. Lets take a little bit of the Titanium White. Lets have some fun back in the background back here
Bob Ross,"We have color on the canvas, so when we take white, maybe well have a little bit of water right here. Think there was a little water in that painting. Just grab it, and pull down"
Bob Ross,"Thats gonna mix with whats already on the canvas and automatically youll get beautiful little water effects, without doin hardly a thing. Maybe it comes right on back. Think this is the way it"
Bob Ross,Think it went right on back like that. Wherever you want it to go. Maybe you want yours to come around this way. Thats all right
Bob Ross,"Painting, and you hear me say this all the time, painting should make you happy. If it does nothing else, it should make you happy. If it doesnt make you happy, then youre doing the wrong thing"
Bob Ross,"Okay. Now then, after you get that pulled down and blended the way you want it, very lightly, two hairs and some air. Let me get a clean brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets just go across and this will create that illusion of reflections of water and that shimmer. Its a very nice and easy way to do it. Now then, lets go back to our two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets begin building all kinds of things. Take a little Bright Red, little Indian Yellow. Makes a beautiful color. There. Lets go up here, maybe right in here"
Bob Ross,"Well put, theres a happy little bush lives there. Once in a while, you can dip your brush into a little bit of the Liquid White to make it a little thinner and a little brighter"
Bob Ross,"Itll make it pop right out of there. In my mind, I think theres light zingin right through there. Maybe theres another one that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"Now, all you have to do is just sort of pick out where you think theres bushes and big ferns. Whatever"
Bob Ross,I used to spend a lot of time in Oregon and Oregon has some of the most beautiful ferns and stuff that hang off everything like that. Its unreal. Maybe up in here
Bob Ross,"Theres a big bush, little bit of highlight up here. Wanna keep that pretty dark, dont wanna lose that nice darkness"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take a little of the Dark Sienna and a little bit of the Yellow Ochre mixed together. Tap a little of that color right into the bristles"
Bob Ross,"Maybe up in here, maybe theres a big tree that lives here and you can make out some of these branches hanging off. Just let them overlap, dont worry about it"
Bob Ross,"Go right over the top of the other one, if you think thats where it should live. Just go right over it. That way itll look natural. It looks like theres very thick foliage"
Bob Ross,"Still just tapping with a top corner of the brush. All there is to it. As we work down here, I want it to get darker and darker"
Bob Ross,"In fact, let me show you, you could take some of this dark color on the knife. Maybe we want to put the indication here that theres a tree trunk here"
Bob Ross,"Since the darks there, all you got to do is put a little light, like so. Its really all that we need. Now then"
Bob Ross,"brush tapping palette Bring some of these nice highlights right over the top of that trunk. Maybe down below it down here, get a little more color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, yeah, theres a nice little bush that lives down here. But it leaves that dark area in there and that dark area gives shadow. Thats where the little creatures live. They hide in there"
Bob Ross,Thats where they stay. Always have to leave a place for them little rascals. Thats where my little squirrel hides. There we go
Bob Ross,"Work in layers, if you work in layers, creates the indication of a lot of bushes, rather than just one big bush. Gives more depth. Now, lets take the old fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Weve been using the old fan brush here. We can come right up in here in this dark, and just by rubbing with a little color, it doesnt take much color"
Bob Ross,"You can begin putting in all your little land areas. Leave some of that dark, especially along this edge. Itll make it look like a bank. And you wont have to do anything"
Bob Ross,"Im lazy, if I can find an easy way to make paintings work, thats what Im looking for. See there. Already, it looks like theres a bank there. And you havent done anything"
Bob Ross,"Really havent done anything. Thats sneaky, huh. I like that. Lets go back into some of the Yellow Ochre, a little Dark Sienna, Cad Yellow, Indian Yellow, all those pretty colors. Tap a little"
Bob Ross,"Right on the corner of the brush again. But see that pushing, thats so important. Get that ridge of paint, being pushed up there. Okay, lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, there lives some bushes and stuff over in here. There he is, there is a nice little bush. Beautiful little bush. Think about shape though. And hes got a friend, right there"
Bob Ross,"See there, maybe theres a bigger one, lives right here. They come in all sizes and shapes. All kinds of personalities, just like people"
Bob Ross,"But no matter, who you are, or what your size or shape, or anything else is, you still need a friend. Everybody needs a friend. Oh, isnt theres a nice bright red one"
Bob Ross,"That rascal jump out and grab you. I like that so much, maybe well just do another one. Reds pretty in there. Little more of the yellows"
Bob Ross,"Now well begin layering, and heres another bush in front of those"
Bob Ross,"This layering effect will, once again, I know you get tired of hearing it, but this layering effect causes the distance and depth in your painting"
Bob Ross,"Now, you can begin thinking about maybe little grassy areas are growing over here. Just by tapping downward, we can create that illusion. Maybe they come right on out like that. I dont know"
Bob Ross,"brush tapping canvas Let your imagination go. Let it go. There. See there, that sorta begins giving you the lay of the land. This side has much more of an angle on it than the other side"
Bob Ross,"That keeps em from both being the same. Maybe it helps it from being boring. All right, going back to my fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little dark color, and lets just go in here and scrub in the indication of a little land underneath this. There, we just scrub it in with a fan brush"
Bob Ross,"You could do it with a knife, if you wanted to. Doesnt much matter. Maybe theres a sandbar here. Seems like we had a nice sandbar. Put in a little dark color first"
Bob Ross,"brush sweeping across canvas Then we can go back with a little white and brown. Very gently, grab it, and go back. Thats all you need to create that illusion"
Bob Ross,"There, but dont kill all that dark area. Leave some of those nice dark areas. Maybe the sands wet there, or somethin. We dont know"
Bob Ross,"Look at there though, thats just such a super way of making a very effective little painting. Now then, lets go on with our little bushy things. Maybe theres a little touch of green here and there"
Bob Ross,"Little Sap Green, not much, but a little. This comes down, now think about this. This is laying flat and this is coming down at quite an angle. So we want to show that"
Bob Ross,"So begin creating that very angle. Maybe, tell you what, maybe were standing up here in the hills, sorta overlooking this and it comes right on around. Right on around like that"
Bob Ross,"brush tapping canvas There we go. But the angles here are most important. Watch here, watch here, watch. See. Just think of the lay of the land and have your brush going that basic direction"
Bob Ross,Thats really all you have to do. Thats all you have to do. The Black Gesso works for you. It puts all the dark in here for you
Bob Ross,"In that under color, the transparent color we put on top, mixes with all this and it keeps your colors beautiful. Just nice things happen"
Bob Ross,"Let me find another fan brush here, I have several of em going. We had a couple of trees in that. So lets take Van Dyke Brown on the fan brush. Just back and forth quite a bit. Maybe touch"
Bob Ross,makes swooshing sound Be brave. This is your bravery test. Lets give him a friend too. makes cascading sound Well do a couple of happy little trees here. Maybe this ones a little stronger
Bob Ross,That way one looks bigger than the other one. Maybe he takes care of this little one. Doesnt allow anybody to hurt him. Everybody needs a big friend
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, maybe this is one tree and maybe its dead. Maybe its dead. In nature, you have a lot of dead trees out in the woods"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes, we avoid painting them, but dead trees are also part of nature. There we go, little bit of paint thinner on the liner brush. Lets go right up in here"
Bob Ross,"Lets just begin putting in all kinds of little limbs that are still hanging on here, even though the tree is dead. There are still a few of em here that are hanging on for dear life"
Bob Ross,"Think thats not right, theyre hangin on for dear life, theyre not dead. But anyway, you know what I mean. Theyre hangin in there. And you put as many or as few"
Bob Ross,"You have to determine how dead your tree is. Maybe it doesnt have hardly any limbs left on it. Its also fun, try this, maybe, and put one of them thats fell down right across the stream there"
Bob Ross,"Make a little natural bridge. That way the little raccoon has a place to sneak across there. There we go. And, whatever you want. Now then, maybe a little highlight on those trees"
Bob Ross,"In my mind, lights gonna be zingin through here. Take a little bit of that light brown and white. Im just gonna take and touch"
Bob Ross,"Just touch, just touch, the canvas will pull off what it wants, and as you work back, because youre pickin up that dirt, dark color. Itll get darker and darker automatically"
Bob Ross,"There, just enough to give it a little highlight. Thats all were looking for. There we go, see. Sometimes, its fun if were gonna have light coming through here, sometimes its fun to take"
Bob Ross,"Ive got the same ol brush here that I had all the yellows on, etc. That I was makin the grass with, and I went right into a little bit of the Titanium White. Wanna lighten. Push it, same way"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up here. Now, think where the lights gonna come"
Bob Ross,"If its coming right through here, you can just take this and tap a little bit of highlight, right in the areas where you think light would strike the strongest. Right in here, okay"
Bob Ross,But dont overdo it. If you overdo it loses its effectiveness. There. Something like so. I think we about have a finished painting with that
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take the liner brush, little bit of paint thinner, little of the Bright Red. Im gonna sign this one. I really hope youve enjoyed it. Its a lot of fun"
Bob Ross,"Allows you to show how our opening was made. It only takes a couple of minutes to paint it, but it takes a lot of fantastic people a great deal of time to stick it in that little square that you see"
Bob Ross,"I sincerely appreciate everything they do. So from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting. God bless, and Ill see you next time"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, Im glad you could join me today, because today I think well do a fantastic little winter scene and I think youll really like this one"
Bob Ross,"So I tell you what, lets start out, have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us"
Bob Ross,"Okay, I have my standard old 18 X 24 inch canvas up here and today weve taken a piece of contact paper and weve just cut a design out, sort of a little half circle type thing in whatever kind of"
Bob Ross,"design you like. Then Ive covered this with liquid white. So its all wet and slick and its ready to go. So, lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes when we do winter scenes, we use so many blues and cold colors that theyre almost uncomfortable, so I sort of like to make very warm winter scenes"
Bob Ross,"Well start with a little Alizarin Crimson today on a 2-inch brush, and just tap a little color right into the bristles,like so"
Bob Ross,"Lets go right up here and maybe right in here well just use our little criss-cross strokes, put in a happy little sky, just making little Xs"
Bob Ross,"It takes very very little color, because if youre not careful, you could set the sky on fire, and we dont want to do that. We dont want to set it on fire. All we want to do is warm it up a little"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Okay, maybe well have a little of that same color down here"
Bob Ross,"If its going to be a winter scene, well have some snow in here, and this will come through and make some very nice highlights and shadows in the snow"
Bob Ross,Its also a good way to clean all the excess paint off your brush. Now then
Bob Ross,"Lets take-- we just mix it on the brush here, well take little more of the Alizarin Crimson, get a little touch of the Phthalo Blue"
Bob Ross,"Proportionately much more crimson than blue and you can just mix these on the brush, see. Like so. You dont have to worry about it"
Bob Ross,"Try and make sort of a nice lavender color, and you can take it to the blue side or the red side, depending on what kind of mood youre in"
Bob Ross,"Today is such a beautiful day, lets just make a very nice, very nice lavender, sort of to the reddish side. And lets just go right up in here and just drop that in, like that"
Bob Ross,Still using the criss-cross strokes. There. And maybe well use a nice little cloud that comes right out here. We just take the brush and tap. Just tap it wherever you want. Its up to you
Bob Ross,Its up to you. Its very individual
Bob Ross,"And maybe down in here, we know, we can just scrub in a basic little cloud shape were really not looking for a lot of detail at this point, all were doing is just building us a happy little sky"
Bob Ross,"There. And we can take a little bit of that same color and once again, just lay some of it down here, where we know theres going to be snow. At this point we really dont care where its going to be"
Bob Ross,"Anything we dont like we just cover up. Were not committed at all. Okay, lets do the fun part here, lets wash the old brush"
Bob Ross,"As you know, we wash our brush with odorless thinner, and we shake off the excess, and just beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,"I really recommend if youre going to do this at home, dont do this in your living room, or your popularity is going to go down about 38 points in one brush cleaning"
Bob Ross,"They make a thing called a brush beater where you put it down in the bottom of a trash can, you shake the brush inside of the can, then beat it on this rack"
Bob Ross,All of its done inside the can and it contains every bit of this
Bob Ross,"And just to stay in good around the homefront, I really recommend you get some kind of procedure not to do this in the living room, or wherever you paint"
Bob Ross,"Take a little bit of the Titanium White on the fan brush just a little, both sides full of color. Okay, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe there lives in our world a beautiful little cloud and it just floats around up here in the sky, it just enjoys looking over the scene"
Bob Ross,"Just use the corner of the brush, thats all were using, just the corner, making tight little circles. There. Very, very tight little circles"
Bob Ross,"And we dont know where this goes, maybe just sort of disappears up here. Well just sort of leave it to your imagination. There"
Bob Ross,"A little more white down here, maybe theres a big old floater that just floats around down here close to the horizon. Alright, now then"
Bob Ross,"With a clean, dry, and it really needs to be clean and dry, 2-inch brush, we want to blend just the base. Were not touching the top at all. Just the base"
Bob Ross,"Very gently, and you just sort of wind it up, blend it together on the base. On the bottom. There. Very gently. And were only using the very top corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,"Thats all thats touching the canvas. There, see there. Just a little. Mix it up, wind it. Now, very gently, big circular strokes will lift that. This fluffs your cloud up. There"
Bob Ross,"Just fluff it up, very lightly. mumbling Just blend it a little, and that whole thing will come together just as neat. And then you go back in here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world there lives another little cloud right here. Work in layers, though. Do the cloud that in your mind is the farthest away. And then work forward"
Bob Ross,"Maybe hes got a little arm sticks right out like that. There. Okay, back to our cleaning. Dry, 2-inch brush, and I do the same thing over again. Thats all there is to it. Okay, fluff it"
Bob Ross,"And very gently, just blend it. Isnt that a beautiful way to make a very effective little sky. And you can do that. You really can do it. Its quite simple. Okay, tell you what"
Bob Ross,"Lets take the old round brush today and Ill make some little background trees back here, just some beautiful little things, maybe well even put some snow on them, who knows"
Bob Ross,"Lets go right up in here, well take-- let me mix up some color. Lets mix up some Phthalo Blue and some Alizarin Crimson Well just make a nice lavender color today"
Bob Ross,"And this mixture proportionately, much much more crimson than blue. Because the blue is 100 times stronger than the crimson. There we are"
Bob Ross,"And if you want to tell what color that is, you need to take a little bit of white and mix it up. Its hard to tell, that just looks black"
Bob Ross,"Thats a little bluer than I really want, so Ill add a little more of the crimson to it. See. You can change your mind, you can change the taste, the flavor, whatever"
Bob Ross,"Maybe you want it into the bluish side. Its very individual. Its up to you. Now then, lets use the old round brush today, its a fantastic brush, make some nice little trees and stuff"
Bob Ross,"And well just tap a little color right into the bristles. Tap firmly. See there. Its hard to see, the old brush is so dark. There we go, just tap it. Now, then"
Bob Ross,"You know, its interesting, in one of the earlier shows I showed my little pet squirrel and we got so many cards and letters Im going to put that little rascal up there again and let you see, because"
Bob Ross,"he was the cutest little thing. This is how it looked when we first got him, and thatll give you an idea, hes sitting on Annettes hand. Now theres what he looks like today"
Bob Ross,"Hes just the cutest little devil, we call her Bobette. And she is a mess. But she lives with me, has a great big cage, we call Squirrel Hilton. Oh. Got me on the nose there. Son of a gun"
Bob Ross,Squirrels are something else. But shes about to the age where shes not going to be friendly anymore. About ready to go back to the wild. So well turn her loose here very soon
Bob Ross,But she is something else. I thought you might enjoy just seeing that little rascal. All Im doing is just tapping in some basic little tree shapes. I have a tremendous love for these little creatures
Bob Ross,And devote a lot of my free time into helping them and taking care of them. Whatever I can do to make their life a little easier
Bob Ross,"And if were going to have animals around, we all have to be concerned about them. Help us out"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, if youve got a little creature that lives in your yard or around where youre at, help him out a little if you can"
Bob Ross,"We have our basic shapes in and we can take a liner brush and put a lot of trunks in there if you want to or we can just take the point of the knife and scrape in all kinds of little tree shapes,"
Bob Ross,"little trunks, little stems, little sticks. Whatever. Now, when this dries, people look at your work and theyll think that you spent hours with your little one-haired brush doing all these"
Bob Ross,"And you wont tell them any different. All you do is up the price a little if youre selling your work. There. Okay. I have several of these old round brushes going, let me grab another one here"
Bob Ross,"Im going to dip it into a little bit of the liquid white. And the liquid white is only to thin the firm white, because remember our golden rule"
Bob Ross,"Remember our golden rule, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. And go right back and get a little of that Bright Red here. I want to put a little pinkish glow into this. There. Now just tap, see"
Bob Ross,"Thats how you load this brush. All you have to do is tap it. Just go up here. Now then, go slightly above the dark and just begin tapping it. All kinds of little snow-covered leaves"
Bob Ross,"In Alaska where I lived for so many years we have ice fog and it would cover everything and just make everything look like this, it was absolutely spectacular"
Bob Ross,"You never think about Alaska, and cold countries like that being beautiful in the winter. But some of the most beautiful, beautiful scenery happens in the winter. There"
Bob Ross,"And I loved to sit inside my warm house and look out at it. Theres a reason I moved back to Florida. In my old age, the cold winters just sort of got me. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And maybe right in here theres another one. Now, you dont have to kill all the dark. Leave some of that dark in there. It makes it look like things are hid back there in the shadows. There"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, this big one back here, Im going to take a little paint thinner, a little of Dark Sienna, and well just thin it down to this like ink and lets just put the indication of a little"
Bob Ross,"tree trunk back here. Its big enough, maybe we can really see a tree trunk in here. There. And you can put as many or as few limbs on your tree trunk as you want"
Bob Ross,"Now, that little touch of the liquid white, a little bit more of the Bright Red, Titanium White, just mix them together on the brush, give it a good tap, tap"
Bob Ross,"And lets go up in here and look at the basic shape of your tree, think about where the light would play through here and hit it. Worry about form and shape. See"
Bob Ross,Theres another little thing right there. These are really fantastic little paintings
Bob Ross,"And, as Ive mentioned every so often, if youre interested in selling paintings, these paintings will sell like hotcakes. Probably more for color than for content"
Bob Ross,And a lot of people buy paintings more for color than for content. Because theyre looking for something to fit a specific need. There we go
Bob Ross,"Lets go all the way over here on the right and put a little bit on this nice tree over here. We dont want him left out, he thought I was about to forget him. Hed have been angry with me"
Bob Ross,"Nobody wants to be left out. Okay, and other one right there. Or wherever. But notice the dark areas in between. See those dark areas. Thats what gives dimension and shape"
Bob Ross,"Dont kill all those dark areas, theyre your very good friend. And we can go back in here, just scrape in a few little sticks and twigs, but mainly in the dark areas. Put them mainly in the dark"
Bob Ross,"And this is just a clean knife. However many you want. Now, time to really have some fun. Lets take the old big brush, well go right into Titanium White. Just load a lot of white paint in there"
Bob Ross,"And its time to make some very big decisions in our painting. Okay, now then, lets go up here and make a decision"
Bob Ross,"If were going to have snow in here, we have to start deciding where our snows going to live. So, make a decision, just put your brush down here, and this big brush will do this very rapidly"
Bob Ross,"And just pull. See there. Thats all there is to it. Just pull it. And begin deciding where all these things are. Be concerned with the lay of the land, now. Begin worrying about angles. There"
Bob Ross,"And just let it flow right out there. Very nice, easy way of laying in a great deal of snow very rapidly. And sometimes you can touch a little touch of the Phthalo Blue"
Bob Ross,"And just blend that in, and itll create the illusion of shadows here and there. And it also makes cool areas in your snow so its not all too warm, that way you have some cool areas"
Bob Ross,"Alright, and well just take out all the brush strokes. It becomes very smooth"
Bob Ross,"Now, well take a fan brush, a little bit of liquid white, a little Titanium White, a little touch of that Bright Red again. And well just mix them together right on the brush. Lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"And then, by pushing upward we can make the indication of some little bushes and stuff that grow right down these snowbanks. Its a nice way of covering up these edges, it brings it all together"
Bob Ross,"There. Just wherever you think they should be. Just push upward. And allow the bristles to bend. Then we take the bottom of it, and blend it right in"
Bob Ross,"Super easy way of making some very effective little areas in your painting. And it pushes all--look how those bushes there now are all pushed back in there, only because of these little things"
Bob Ross,"And youre working with planes. And those planes cause dimension and depth in your painting. Okay, shoot. Were having so much fun. Lets get crazy. Im going to go right into some Phthalo Blue here"
Bob Ross,"Not much. Not much. In fact, there was still some white left on the bristles from the snow. A little Phthalo Blue"
Bob Ross,"Im going to put a little water in here, you know me and my water, I like to have water in all my paintings, nearly. Touch, and pull straight down"
Bob Ross,"You just have to make a decision where your water lives. Touch and pull down. Now, once again, this blue is a very cool color"
Bob Ross,Itll really do nice things against all these pinks and stuff that we have in here. A very cool color. Maybe theres just a happy little pond here that comes right around in there
Bob Ross,I dont know exactly. Well decide that later. Pull straight down. Most important to pull straight down. Now get a clean brush
Bob Ross,"I have several brushes going here so I dont have to spend all my time washing brushes, as much fun as it is, and as much as the camera people hate it, we wont do all that. There. Now, that quick"
Bob Ross,"That gives us a nice little watery area. Now, take a touch of the liquid white on the knife, a little Titanium White, and well mix them together. Liquid white and Titanium White"
Bob Ross,"The liquid white is in there only to thin the Titanium White a little bit. And Ive put at least a little touch of the Bright Red in there. Now, cut me off a little roll of paint, and lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Now Im going to put a little snow lane right along in here, so we touch and just sort of let it work its way right off the blade there. Get a little more paint. There. See how well that works"
Bob Ross,"Maybe comes right around the corner here. We dont know. Just put it right around. That easy. Now, then. Clean off my old knife. Lets go back to our round brush and our lavender color"
Bob Ross,"Well tap a little color into the bristles. Just like so, just tap it. Maybe over in here. Maybe. Yep. Yep, there is now. Well put a happy little bush or two that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"Now, I want to leave this little bit of water showing through so you can see that theres water behind there, I think itll make that look nice. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Underneath that, well pull a little bit of that color down. There. Now, then. Now, well take the other round brush, a little liquid white, a little bit of the Bright Red, not much"
Bob Ross,Be very careful of the Bright Red. Itll set your whole world on fire in one heartbeat
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go right up here, got the brush loaded up and lets put in some nice little frosted areas right on these bushes. Once again, work on one bush at a time"
Bob Ross,"Dont get too carried away, we have plenty of time. Dont worry about it. One little bush at a time. There. See there. And if you do one at a time, then you have depth"
Bob Ross,"I know you get tired of hearing that, I really think its important though. There we go. Now, go back to our"
Bob Ross,"This is liquid white, mixed with a little bit of Titanium White, then go right in here and put all of our little snow-covered ground areas. There"
Bob Ross,"Alright, and this reflection, we pull it straight down then we go gently across. Then we go back in here with our clean knife and just scratch out a few little sticks and twigs, wherever you want"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Now, tell you what. Shoot, maybe lets take some Van Dyke Brown, get us a little roll of paint maybe right up here, lives a happy little tree. There it goes. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"Just straight Van Dyke Brown. Then we do the other side. Now, lets give him a friend. Shoot, we dont need him to be alone. Lifes too short to be alone. Too precious. Share it with a friend. There"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take a little Titanium White, a little roll of paint on the knife, and lets have--maybe this is a birch tree. What the heck. Touch, give it a little pull around. Give it a little pull"
Bob Ross,"Birch trees may be one of the easiest kind of trees there are to make. And if theres not birch trees in your area, shoot, you can paint any kind of little tree that you want"
Bob Ross,"Maybe you want to paint a big maple tree in yours, or oak tree, or whatever. Its okay. A little paint thinner, a little bit of the Van Dyke Brown. Turn the bristles"
Bob Ross,"Turn it, it brings it to a nice sharp point. Lets go right up in here, well put the indication here and there of some little trunks, or little limbs. Off the trunk"
Bob Ross,"Ill get it straight here in a second, bear with me. There we go. Wherever you think they should live. There. Okay, theres another one. Theres one"
Bob Ross,"And try not to make all your limbs just perfectly straight, put some character in them, shoot. Tree limbs grow every which old way. Whatever makes them happy. Theyre independent little devils"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres just one old one thats sticking out here. Shoot, like that. Whatever. We dont care. See. You can have as many or as few as you want in your world. I like that"
Bob Ross,"Lets make a different kind of tree. Lets go over here. Shoot, tell you what. Lets make--well just use the fan brush. Lets make a tree that lives right about. Big old tree. There"
Bob Ross,"Big old tree, well give him another arm right there. See. We draw the trunk in right there. That easy"
Bob Ross,"Now, then we can take a little bit of the white, and this time instead of pulling it around like a birch tree all Im going to do is touch the canvas, maybe this is a different kind of tree"
Bob Ross,"Show you how to make two or three different kinds of trees. All youre doing is just touching it with the knife, though. Just touch. The canvas will pull off what it wants, give you back whats left"
Bob Ross,There. And as you work around itll get darker and darker and darker. A little bit of brown there. And all were doing is just touching the canvas. This makes a very effective tree
Bob Ross,And when its dry you can almost feel that bark. Everybody will want to touch your painting. There. Just be sure its dry before you let them touch it
Bob Ross,"Because thatll upset you, if somebody touches it while its wet. Lets put some limbs out here, just using the Van Dyke Brown, the liner brush, a little thinner on it. There we go"
Bob Ross,"We dont know where it goes. Wherever. Wherever. Every trees an individual. Its different, so chances are no matter how you paint it somewhere theres a tree just like that. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe theres a baby tree that lives right here. There. And when spring comes, hes going to have leaves all over and hell be a beauty. Hell be a beauty"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets put some bushes down here around its foots. Got to have a bush or two down there. Maybe it comes right on out like that"
Bob Ross,"Okay, then our other round brush with a light color on it, liquid white, Titanium White, a little Bright Red"
Bob Ross,"And Ill put the Bright Red, and Im going to give this a nice pinkish glow, makes it a little prettier. As I mentioned earlier, it keeps it from being so cold that its distasteful"
Bob Ross,"Makes it a beautiful little warm scene. There we go. Maybe in our world, maybe at one time a long time ago, maybe there was an old fence here. Maybe a couple of old posts still hanging out"
Bob Ross,"Little highlight on them. Shoot, who knows. Maybe theres still a wire or two hanging in there, wherever you want them. Up to you. A little Titanium White, and go right in here now"
Bob Ross,"Grab that, pull it right on over. Look at that. See. Sort of brings it all together. Shoot, that easy. Tell you what"
Bob Ross,"Lets bring the camera up here, and lets take the contact paper off and see what we have. This is the moment of truth right here. I love these little contact paper things, theyre so pretty"
Bob Ross,"And, as wed mentioned before, if youre out selling your work, these son of a guns will sell. I think Ill sign this one right here. And call him finished. I hope this is one youll try"
Bob Ross,"Because its a beautiful, beautiful little scene. Itll make you happy inside. And as we mentioned earlier, thats what paintings all about. Thats the joy of painting. From all of us here"
Bob Ross,"Happy painting, and God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,"lighthearted guitar music - This program is brought to you by North Light Books, publisher of over 200 how-to books and videos for fine artists and graphic designers"
Bob Ross,"And by Langnickel, manufacturers of selected artist brushes"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, Im certainly glad you could join me today. Today I thought wed do just a fantastic little seascape, and just have a super time together"
Bob Ross,"So Ill tell you what, lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this little seascape with me"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive already done. Standard old 18 by 24 inch double primed pre-stretched canvas"
Bob Ross,"And I coated the bottom of it here with Black Gesso, and allowed that to dry completely. Then I just put a little piece of masking tape across here"
Bob Ross,The masking tape is only to keep the horizon line straight
Bob Ross,"Underneath here Ive covered this with a mixture of Sap Green and Van Dyke Brown mixed about half way, little bit of Indian Yellow, and right here in the corner a little Dark Sienna"
Bob Ross,"Now these colors are all transparent enough, this still looks black"
Bob Ross,"The top of this, I sort of put in a little basic cloud shape I wanna big cloud here, with Black Gesso, and the we just covered this with a thin even coat of the liquid white"
Bob Ross,"So its all wet and ready to go, so lets have some fun. Lets start out today with a little touch of the Yellow Ochre, very small amount is all we need on the two inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Just a tiny little bit, maybe well add a little of the Cad Yellow to it, there. Just mix those two sort of together"
Bob Ross,"And lets go right up here, and just lay in a little bit of this yellow, right across here. Just using little crisscross strokes. There. Something about like so"
Bob Ross,"Then well go back into a little more of the Yellow Ochre, and lay that right in there. Little touch more, didnt get quite enough there. Then well just let that one blend right on down"
Bob Ross,"This is just Yellow Ochre, and a little bit of Cad Yellow. Thats all we have here. Right in the bottom. Help me just do a beautiful, beautiful sky today"
Bob Ross,Well spend most of our time working on the sky. Then well put a little seascape down in here
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe the least little touch, least little touch, of a little bit of the Alizarin Crimson, right along there. So were just sort of playing with nice warm colors. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Okay, blend that all together. Let me clean the old brush. Just wash your brush with odorless thinner. Shake it off. laughs Then just cover everybody in the studio"
Bob Ross,"Alright, lets make us a nice lavender color. For that well take some Alizarin Crimson, and Phthalo Blue. Crimson and Blue. Okay, a little more blue. I want this sort of to the blueish side today"
Bob Ross,"And depending on your mood, you may want it to the red side or to the blue side. Take a little white, check it out and see what we have. Thats not bad, thats a good color"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets clean off the old knife. Today lets use the fan brush. Well take a fan brush, add a little bit of this lavender color onto it we made. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"And lets just go up in here, and using little, Im gonna exaggerate, little rocking strokes like that. Lets just begin putting in some very basic little, little cloud formations here. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And I use this lavender color, mainly, so in case it touches some of this yellow, it wont turn a bright green on us. Green skies are alright, I guess, but thats not what were looking for today"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Today were looking for just a nice beautiful sky, we dont want it to be green. Okay, maybe this runs right up in here, wherever. Just be very loose with this, and just throw it in"
Bob Ross,"Ive got the Black Gesso underneath this, only so that dark shows through. It really helps make this a lot easier"
Bob Ross,"Now then, while I have that little bit of lavender on here, lets go right in here, and maybe just put the indication of a happy little cloud or two, thats just sort of floating around and having a"
Bob Ross,good time. Wherever you think they would live. Just sort of pull them out there. Maybe Im gonna add a little more of the crimson to that
Bob Ross,"And right on down in here, maybe right at the water line, maybe theres a nice cloud thats living right here. There"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of make up little stories, and little, little things like that and let your imagination sort of just take you everywhere. There it goes. Maybe it comes all the way over, who cares"
Bob Ross,"Then it turns around and comes back, see. But you can do anything in here. Any old thing that you want to do. Maybe, maybe right up in here we have a nice bright area"
Bob Ross,"We can put that in too, take a little white, and just begin working it. In fact, maybe its right here. There, just let that work right on out. This is just straight Titanium White. There we go"
Bob Ross,"You could even go so far as take your finger, with a little white on it, and make the indication of a little sun in there if you wanted to. You can do that. There, and very gently just blend over it"
Bob Ross,"And the indication will still be there, and that white that you put on then becomes the bright area around it. There"
Bob Ross,"There we can just blend these little clouds, and we can blend those right into the sky. That easy"
Bob Ross,"In fact, tell you what, lets have a little cloud, comes right around like this, maybe he just floats around in the sky, maybe he comes right on down here"
Bob Ross,"We dont know where he goes, wherever you want him, thats where he should be. There. Then take our big brush, and just blend. Alright"
Bob Ross,"I have several old fan brushes going so I dont have to spend all my time washing brushes. Im gonna take a little white on the fan brush here. Okay, lets go back up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little highlight that lives right here on this cloud. Dont want a great deal, just enough to make it stand out a little. There, a little over here"
Bob Ross,"See, theres your light source, so wherever you think light would hit it, just make that decision and drop it in. Just drop it in. Maybe theres a little up here on top of this. Wherever. Wherever"
Bob Ross,"There. Now when youre doing this at home you can put a lot more detain into it, you have unlimited amounts of time. Here if I go over 30 minutes, this mean old director gets all over me"
Bob Ross,"But at home you can do it any way that you want to do it. Now we can fluff that up, blend it a little. And it makes quite a nice sky down here. Now then, lets go back into our fan brush"
Bob Ross,"And lets go up in here, and lets just begin picking out some little shapes and things that are happening. All were gonna do is just bounce a little highlight here and there, just bounce it in"
Bob Ross,Then well come back and blend it a little bit. There. Were really working that paint right into the fabric. Okay. Maybe a little right over in here
Bob Ross,"Let me add a little crimson into my white, a little Alizarin Crimson to brighten it up just a tiny bit. There. See we can put all kinds of little things for the light zinging through there"
Bob Ross,There we go. In between some of these maybe theres even a little bit of Phthalo Blue. There. mumbles Then we can take a clean dry two inch brush. And this is where we can blend all of this together
Bob Ross,"Just using the corner of the brush. And lift it, blend it, and very lightly, very lightly just work it all together. There. But work with each individual cloud, make friends with it"
Bob Ross,Begin to see things happening in it. Then you can create some of the most beautiful illusions imaginable. There we go. Some little highlights up in here zinging around
Bob Ross,"There, some little things in here, just drop them in, just drop them in, then blend them, bring them together. There we are. Clean dry two inch brush, and just very gently bring all this together"
Bob Ross,"See there. Fluff it, blend it. There we go. You can make some unbelievable skies, very simply, all you have to do is just practice a little bit. And you wouldnt believe what you could make"
Bob Ross,"Would not believe. Alright, maybe somewhere up in here even, there we go. Just put all these things in, I see another one right here. Wherever you want them"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of look around it and make big decisions where you think they should live. There we are, that one runs right along. Right along the top up there"
Bob Ross,"We dont even know where it goes, we dont care where it goes. Its up here somewhere though. Way up here in the sky. Theres something over in here, Wherever you think they should live"
Bob Ross,"Okay, back to our clean dry two inch brush. And very gently just blend. There we go. There"
Bob Ross,"Yeah I talk about this mean old director all the time, we want to put a picture of her in the newsletter so you can see what she looks like. There. Okay. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now you can continue to work with this, and just create all kinds of beautiful things. Just work with it"
Bob Ross,"Keep building, but kill all your dark areas, its very easy to get carried away, kill all the dark areas. Those dark areas are what give it depth and strength. Make it look big, and powerful"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Okay, we dont want to spend the whole show working on the sky so Ill, move on down here a little bit. Because I love to play with skies and I could spend the rest of the day here"
Bob Ross,"Not just the show, but the rest of the whole day here. Because I think this is really a great deal of fun. Alright. Now, as I mentioned when we started, I have a piece of masking tape right here"
Bob Ross,"The masking tape is only to keep the horizon straight. So well take that off. But now underneath that tape of course, Theres none of the color that we put up there"
Bob Ross,"Because the tape wouldnt stick to that. So well take a little Van Dyke Brown, a little Sap Green. And Ill just run right in here. And well just lay on a little bit of color"
Bob Ross,"Right up to the horizon line. There we are, okay. Were in business. Now then, what I would recommend when youre doing a seascape, first of all, well just take the old filbert brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets lay out our major wave here, thatll make everything much easier if you have that laid out. And so, lets say its gonna come up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe its gonna crash over and go imitates wave breaking right in here somewhere, and itll come out like this. Then all your waves back here will, they will spread out like a fan"
Bob Ross,"Just like a fan, okay. Now then, clean off the old brush here. Wipe it down, this filbert brush we just, clean with paint thinner and then wipe it off"
Bob Ross,"Grab my fan brush, well take a little bit of the Titanium White, lets go right back here and decide where our waves behind the major waves are gonna live. Maybe theyre right here"
Bob Ross,"All you have to do is sort of block it in. Just about like so. Maybe put the indication back here of, another one. Okay, then well wipe all the excess paint off our brush"
Bob Ross,"And very gently grab that, and begin working it back, back, back. See. And that light becomes the trough, or the area in between the waves. Then well just sort of let these blend back"
Bob Ross,A little more white and we can go back here to the horizon. Begin adding in all kinds of little distant things. We just want indications way back here
Bob Ross,Itll pick up that Sap Green thats underneath and automatically thatll jump right out at you
Bob Ross,"Maybe this waves gonna come right down through here, and then, let me wipe off that excess, then well blend that back. Very lightly, very very lightly"
Bob Ross,"Dont wanna lose that dark area right there, that little dark area right there is very important to us. Thats our friend and we want to take care of it"
Bob Ross,"Now the fun part of any wave is this eye right here, or the transparency"
Bob Ross,"So lets take a little bit of the Titanium White, least least little touch of the Cad Yellow in it, and well use the old filbert brush. Load the color into it and lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Decide where this transparency is gonna live. Or the eye of the wave. And just really scrub this color in, scrub it right in. And you can do this as many times as you want"
Bob Ross,"To achieve the desired lightness. There we go. Okay now well take a clean, dry two inch brush and just use the top corner, and very gently, just sort of wind it up. The brush is hardly moving"
Bob Ross,It just sort of stays in one place and goes around and around and thatll blend all that together. And itll get just as smooth as silk. Just as smooth as it can be
Bob Ross,"We just let that run right on out til it disappears. Now we can begin thinking about the shape, and blend. There we go. And already we begin having the general outline of our wave there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, Im gonna clean up some brushes here. Wash this old filbert brush off. Be sure its dry. Okay, now then, I have several fan brushes going"
Bob Ross,"So, lets take a little of the Titanium White, put it on the fan brush. And lets make this wave curve over. Maybe it comes right here goes imitates wave breaking gotta make those little noises"
Bob Ross,"And have it just curve right over. Maybe it curves to right there, we dont know where it goes. Dont know that we really care. Just bring it right over, there we go. Now, back to our filbert"
Bob Ross,"Well use a little of this, oh we can use a little lavender color, it doesnt matter, what the heck. And lets go in here, and just put in some shadow indications for foam"
Bob Ross,"This is just basically the lavender color. And maybe it comes right on up, there it is. Just like so, there"
Bob Ross,"And right on around, there is a nice splash, churn, imitates wave breaking wherever you want it. Wherever you want it, there we go. Okay, wash off the old brush"
Bob Ross,"Dry it off, and well go right into a little bit of that Titanium White, you could even put the least little bit of that purple into it, just to give it a little lavender hue, but not much"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe lets go right in here. Now lets put a little highlight on this foam. Push very hard, make it just jump right off there. There, little more color"
Bob Ross,"Same over here, were gonna have all these nice splashes and crashes. When your color gets contaminated, just wipe your brush off real good, and go back into it, there"
Bob Ross,Well have a nice crashing up in here. Wherever you think it should be. Just sort of look at it and figure out where it should go. There. Comes right on down in there
Bob Ross,"Now then, back to our large brush. But be sure its dry, if its not dry, youre gonna mix this all up into mud and youre gonna be very upset with me"
Bob Ross,"Just using the top bristles, and I find the two inch brush works better than the one inch, but you might wanna try the one inch"
Bob Ross,"A lot of people seem to like it better, I just prefer the two inch, theres more hair thats actually touching the canvas than with the one inch. There we go. mumbles That easy"
Bob Ross,"Keep your brush clean, and dry. Alright. And then we can take our liner brush, liner brush, liner brush. Well take some of the white, this is just Titanium White with paint thinner"
Bob Ross,And we can go right along here and we can begin highlighting some of these little things right in here. imitates wave breaking See now. There we go
Bob Ross,"And heres our light source, so thats where we want this to be the lightest. And we can come right back in here, just begin dropping in some little highlights and stuff. There"
Bob Ross,"Then well start adding a little lavender here and there as I work away from that light area, so it wont be quite as bright. I wanna retain that brightness"
Bob Ross,"Then we can begin just putting in all kinds of little things. There, see. And the more of these little details that you put in, the better your particular painting will look"
Bob Ross,"And thatll make you happy, when they look good like that. There we go. Maybe back in here, let some of these go back. There. And these little lines create shape and form"
Bob Ross,And back in here theres a few. This gives your wave roundness and shows foam patterns and stuff that are working all up in here and playing. But this is where it all comes together
Bob Ross,"All these little things, little happy things here. Then you can take a little of the darker color, and come right around here, put a little line under there. And thatll act as your separator"
Bob Ross,"See, bring it right in there. Just like so. Now maybe, lets have a little shimmer on the water, shoot, lets have some fun. Take a little Titanium White, Theres our light source"
Bob Ross,"Lets just pull this right down. Straight down, right there. All were using is a little Titanium White, but all those beautiful colors are underneath here"
Bob Ross,"This is the Indian Yellow and the Dark Sienna, and its all coming alive now. You dont hardly even know its there until you start putting a little white on there"
Bob Ross,"And then, kaboom, jumps right out at you. There we go. Wherever you want them. Sort of look at where your light source is, now, very lightly, we go across"
Bob Ross,"And thatll give the indication, of very wet areas. So blend it together, there we go. See how that just comes right together. Sneaky"
Bob Ross,"Now lets take the small knife, I like a little knife for this, and well take a little bit of the white, Titanium White. Now, come right down in here, so we can watch right in here"
Bob Ross,"See where this is gonna come. Push very firmly, very firmly. Re-load the knife. Just that little roll of paint causes that though. See there, there we go"
Bob Ross,"This little knife really works better for this than the big knife, really works better. Put a few little things in here. See how you can make all those little ripples and stuff. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you think they should be. Then we can take a fan brush, and very lightly grab that and blend it back"
Bob Ross,"See, and leave some of those shiny things showing through, it looks like wetter it is there. Beautiful, very pretty. We get all of our foam thats travelling up the wave. There we go, Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, back to our little liner brush. And maybe here theres some, there you go, thats the last little watery area, goes right there. Like so, Okay, there it is. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, in here, just all kinds of little things"
Bob Ross,"Did I say, at home you have time to do this in a lot of detail, and youll be amazed at what an effective way this is to do some very beautiful seascapes, just spectacular at times. There we are"
Bob Ross,"And anybody can do them. And I do these kind rather than just the little, little ones that look like that. Because theyre a little more interesting. There"
Bob Ross,Its easy to make those just look like one little wave that sort of fell over
Bob Ross,"I like to make something thats got a nice wave going in them and some action, and, shoot, maybe well even put a rock or two in here, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"I like to put rocks in there, gives a wave something to splash against, and fun with. Now we got that old brush wet, Ill take a little bit of the brown, maybe up here, there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe there, well put some little seagulls or M birds, as theyre called. There we go. See, theres some happy little birds floating around up in there. Tell you what, lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Lets take, lets take that old filbert brush, well put some Van Dyke in it. Let me reach over here and get a little a little bit of the liquid white"
Bob Ross,"Well put some Dark Sienna, a little Yellow Ochre in it. Pile it up"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Im gonna put Van Dyke Brown on both sides of the filbert, and then pull one side, just one side, right through this light color. Now then, maybe theres some stones live right out in here"
Bob Ross,"In the water. This is the easiest way Ive ever seen, of making some very effective little stones. Maybe hes got a little friend lives there. You know, however many you want, maybe well have three"
Bob Ross,"See, and just let that highlight come right off there. Take our liner brush, little bit of thin white paint on it, put a little bottom around these stones"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, were about to have a finished painting"
Bob Ross,"But give this one a try, and if you have time, drop me a line, let me see what kind of result youre having because that makes it all worthwhile if its working for you, and Id love to hear from you"
Bob Ross,"I think well call this one finished. So, give this one a try as I say, and drop me a line"
Bob Ross,"We take all the pictures sometime, put them together and we like to show them on TV, so maybe youll see yours here. From all of us here, happy painting and God bless my friend. jazzy music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, Im certainly glad you could join me today because its a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever youre at. Tell you what, lets just do a beautiful little painting today"
Bob Ross,"Every days sort of crazy around here, so I thought today wed start with something a little different"
Bob Ross,"So I tell you what, lets have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that let me tell you what I already done up here"
Bob Ross,"Ive taken a piece of contact paper and put it on my standard old 18 by 24 inch canvas here, and Ive cut two ovals out of it"
Bob Ross,"And then Ive coated the inside of these two ovals with a mixture of liquid white and liquid black, so I guess youd call it liquid grey"
Bob Ross,"And we just put a nice thin, even coat and its all ready to go. The rest of this is just decoration, because its getting a little crazy here. So I thought wed have some fun today"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little bit of the midnight black, well use the old two inch brush, midnight black, little of the, oh, well do some dark sienna, reach over here, Ill get a little alizarin crimson"
Bob Ross,"Just mix em together, like so. Black, dark sienna, little alizarin crimson, very dark color though. Very dark color. Alright, maybe today well do a scene thats deep in the woods here"
Bob Ross,"I dont know, lets just start off and have some fun. Lets just take and begin putting in the indication of all kinds of little shapes"
Bob Ross,And well just start off tapping in some very basic little shapes and sort of see what happens. Just see what happens. Now I made this grey mixture today because I want this to be very subdued
Bob Ross,And this grey will mix with everything that we put on there and itll cause that to happen automatically. And if theres any of this grey showing through then itll look just right. There
Bob Ross,Just begin laying in all kinds of little shapes. And right now all were looking for is just some basic ideas. Were not looking for a lot of detail
Bob Ross,Well come back and look at what we have and then well begin picking out each individual little thing. Right now all were doing basically is blocking in some ideas
Bob Ross,"So we have the midnight black, dark sienna, a little alizarin crimson, maybe right here, what the heck. Well have some here too. Just let these things run right on through. There"
Bob Ross,"Now when youre playing at home try this liquid grey, as I call it, itll make some beautiful effects for you. Mix these mediums together. We have the clear, the black, the white, mix em together"
Bob Ross,"You wont believe some of the effects. Personally, I like to take a little of the liquid white and clear and put it together. And it gives the white, oh, it gives it a little bit of transparence"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes that comes in very handy for creating certain effects and certain illusions. There we go. Okay, a little bit more of the black and the crimson. There"
Bob Ross,"But see you can begin finding little shapes in here and all were using is just the corner of the two inch brush. But these little shapes will, theyll just sort of begin to appear. Its real easy"
Bob Ross,Its one of the nicest ways to sort of just lay out a little painting. There
Bob Ross,"Okay, now lets take our liner brush, well dip it in some paint thinner, and well go right into some of the brown, a little Van Dyke brown is fine"
Bob Ross,"Make this paint very thin, turn it, bring the bristles to a nice, sharp point. See how sharp that is. We like paint in there. Now then we can go up here and begin picking out little individual things"
Bob Ross,"If you have trouble making the paint flow off your liner brush then add more paint thinner. Its all you have to do. Keep the paint very thin, very loose, and itll just slide right off your brush"
Bob Ross,"See, and we can just put the indication of all kinds of little things"
Bob Ross,"In some of these light areas, these little holes here, there you just put the indication of a few little sticks and twigs that are showing through. There. See, maybe right in here, we dont know"
Bob Ross,"Well separate all this with highlights, were gonna come back in put all kinds of little highlights"
Bob Ross,"Right now all were interested in is just creating the illusion of a lot of little things happening in here. Okay, lets do that also over here on the other side"
Bob Ross,"Well need something going on over here too. There, maybe theres a tree there too, we dont know. Wherever, wherever. There. See, maybe back in here. All kinds of little doers"
Bob Ross,"There, and then you say, say theres one there. There he goes, right on up. Just sort of let your imagination just take you astray here. There we go. Maybe right in here"
Bob Ross,"But see, just by putting these little sticks in here you begin making out little individual things that easy. And itll just happen for you automatically"
Bob Ross,Practice this a little bit and youll be amazed at what you can do by just throwing some color on a canvas. Alright. Wash the old brush. And well just wipe it off on a paper towel
Bob Ross,And Ill just use the same little dirty brush since I have it going here
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little bit of the yellow, a little yellow, reach up here, grab a little black, we put that in there and thatll make a beautiful green color. There, tap it a little bit"
Bob Ross,"That gets that little roll of paint right out on the edge of the bristles. Okay. Now then, lets go up in here and begin picking up all these little individual things"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back in here lives a happy tree right there. Just think about form and shape for this tree. And just begin dropping him out. There. See there. There he is. We knew he was there, didnt we. Yeah"
Bob Ross,"And maybe add a little of the yellow ochre and Indian yellow, maybe way back in there, oh, there he is, theres another little rascal. Boy, my little squirrel would love to live back in here"
Bob Ross,"Theres so many things happening. There. So you just, just sort of look at these things though and drop em in. And all were doing is just using the corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,"Its really all we have going here, just the corner of the brush. But think about individuals. Lets add a little touch of the bright red here and there. There, oh, thats nice"
Bob Ross,"Ive probably painted 25, 30 thousand paintings now and I still get excited every time I see this work. Its fascinating. There we go. Are you beginning to see all these little things"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that exciting that it happens that easy. Shoot. Thats the joy of painting. That truly is the joy of painting, when you get to the point that you have no fear"
Bob Ross,"Lets go over on the other oval over on the other side here. We dont want him left out. See there, theres another little tree, little bush"
Bob Ross,"Little Indian yellow maybe and a little touch of the bright red, put a little sparkler way back there. See, just by varying color and shape and form you can create all kinds of things"
Bob Ross,"All kinds of things. There. I like these little paintings. They make you feel good inside and thats what lifes all about. Makes you happy. There. See, layer after layer"
Bob Ross,This layering effect is what causes it to have depth and distance and keeps it from being just a flat old piece of canvas. Theres dimension in there just because of the layers
Bob Ross,"Im gonna dip the brush into the least little touch of liquid white, just the least little touch. There. Okay. And we can come back in here and drop in all kinds of little rascals, theres another"
Bob Ross,"There. But see how, see how nice that grey works back in there for you. Its really a fantastic way to paint. Maybe Ill put another one right here"
Bob Ross,"See, you just keep seeing things and you just add more and more. There. Boy, I bet theres a mosquito or two that lives back in there. Thats a beautiful place. But you know what"
Bob Ross,"You know me, I think there oughta be, maybe lets have, lets have, I see something happening right here"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little liquid white, a little bit of the, little bit of the titanium white, Ill be right back, dont go away, and a little touch of the phthalo blue. Little touch"
Bob Ross,"Okay, we have a very light blue on there now. Lets go right up in here. And maybe in our world, look right here, watch, watch, watch, watch"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little bit of water just plays along and blip, falls over. See, just let it, blip. Gotta make that little noise. Maybe it just spills right along like that"
Bob Ross,"Comes right outta there, blip, there it fell again. Son of a gun, blip. Look at that, see, just blip, and splash when it hits. Push upward to make that splashy effect"
Bob Ross,And we have a happy little stream thats just running right outta there. That easy. Where is it gonna go. Now we have to start making some big decisions here
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets just take a, well grab a one inch brush here, and well take a little touch of sap green. Im just gonna throw it right there"
Bob Ross,"I wanna reflect all these nice colors right into the water. Put a little sap green there. Maybe, maybe a little yellow ochre. Oh, thats pretty. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe even a little touch of white right through there. And there, a little bright spot. Maybe back to some green. This is just sap green on a one inch brush. Im pulling it straight down"
Bob Ross,"Straight down. Thisll let that blend together. Lets go over on the other side over here. Over in here maybe well have a little more of that. Shoot, that looks good. That looks good enough to eat"
Bob Ross,"A little yellow ochre right in there. Maybe, maybe, maybe a little more green. I dont know, but you can just put all kinds of beautiful colors right in here like this"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we get a clean two inch brush and I wanna grab that firmly and pull it down. Very firm. Grab it and pull down. Straight down, like so. And then across"
Bob Ross,"See that, makes it look like reflections in the water. There. Now then, lets go back to our little fan brush here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this water comes right on down here, bounces around, and just begins to play and have fun. Shoot, we dont know where it goes. Just make all kinds of beautiful effects. You know what we need"
Bob Ross,"Lets have some little stones that live out here. For that let me get out a little liquid white and well put that right up here, like so"
Bob Ross,"And Im gonna add a little bit of dark sienna to that, maybe even a little yellow ochre. Just make a very nice, warm little light brown color. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, well take our, lets use the old filbert brush, well go right into, well go right into a little dark sienna and Van Dyke brown mixed together"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then, both sides of the brush, now right here well take one side and go through this thin color that weve made, see. Its brown on one side, light on the other"
Bob Ross,"And maybe up in here in our world maybe theres just all kinds of little stones. Look at that, see em. Just all kinds of happy little stones live up in here"
Bob Ross,And you can make as many or as few as you want in your world. Theres another one. These are just everywhere. They live right here in this brush. Maybe they come right over here. Just all kinds of em
Bob Ross,"All kinds of em. Maybe theres a big one here. Great old big one. Maybe, more paint, maybe, maybe right here. Just sort of make up your mind where you think they should live and drop em in"
Bob Ross,"Theres some. But make em all different sizes. Some are big, some are small. Theyre like people"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna grab the bottom of these and pull em down just a little bit, just the bottom, and then go lightly across. Thatll create a little reflection in the water. Just a little reflection. There"
Bob Ross,"See there. Now then, well take our fan brush, and it has liquid white mixed with titanium white with a least little touch of the phthalo blue in it. There. Okay, a lot of paint on the bristles"
Bob Ross,"Now then, well come right in here with this color and lets just begin to wrap a little water right around these rocks. Thatll set them right down into the painting, brings everything together"
Bob Ross,"See there. Now lets go over to the other side here. Maybe, here it comes, right on through, a little water right there"
Bob Ross,"And our world, maybe this waters coming along here and all of a sudden, swoop, falls over again. See there. You can drop that water over as many times as you want"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe theres a stone that lives right there. You can have as many little rocks and stuff. Maybe theres another one down here at the bottom of this little waterfall. Its up to you"
Bob Ross,"Bring that water right there, and that pushes that stone right into it. Comes down, falls over. And well have a few little splashes down here where it hits. There. See"
Bob Ross,"Now we can take our paint thinner, little bit of the brown, thin it down very thin, and lets go back in here and put the indication here and there of a few more sticks and twigs and little things"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe down here in the foreground, maybe theres some stuff over here, so for that lets go back into our black, little dark sienna, little bit of the alizarin crimson, well just mix these on the"
Bob Ross,"brush. Tap a little bit of color right into the bristles, tap firmly. Alright, lets go up in here and lets decide where little things live over here"
Bob Ross,"There they are, theres a happy bush and he lives right there, like so. Get a little more color. And hes got a little friend here. There. Okay, good"
Bob Ross,These are so much fun to make and by putting some bushes here in the foreground that pushes everything back. See how far back this all went. Pushed that little waterfall way back in there. There
Bob Ross,"Maybe a few little things right in here. And we can take our knife and just go in here and scratch in the indication of a stick and a twig. There. Now, well just use that same old brush, Im lazy"
Bob Ross,"Its got color all over it, but thats alright. Well go right into the yellows here and the, lets see, weve got cad yellow, yellow ochre, a little of the Indian yellow"
Bob Ross,"Here and there were gonna touch a little bright red. Just like so. Okay, now then, lets go up here and put some highlights on this old bush. There. There he is. Just use the corner of a brush though"
Bob Ross,"And make all these little individual things. Little individual things. Little for this one. There. Maybe well touch a little red right here. Oh, thats nice, thats nice"
Bob Ross,Be careful with that red though. Too much of its distracting and almost invariably your eye will go to that red place. Almost cant help but look there
Bob Ross,"So dont get too much, can get too distracting on you very rapidly. Maybe right here. There. Okay, maybe a little sap green, little black here, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Over on this side maybe well put a few little leaves and stuff out here. There he is. Just all kinds of little things. Now you can make these as bright as you want em, or you can make em subdued"
Bob Ross,"Either way. I like em a little more subdued today, but maybe a week from now wed like to have em nice and bright again. Its up to you. And your mood changes continually"
Bob Ross,"And when your mood changes your painting will change. Its almost something you cant help, it just sort of happens"
Bob Ross,"Now I wanna take my little liner brush here and Im gonna take a little bit of paint thats almost white, very thin, and here and there put in a few little white trunks back here"
Bob Ross,"You always have some of those in the woods and they stand out very good against all this dark. They just sort of make it interesting. There. Just here and there. Okay, maybe a couple on the other side"
Bob Ross,"And we can just have some fun. Alright, Ill tell you what lets do, I think were to a point where we can take the contact paper off and lets see what we have"
Bob Ross,"So we just grab it, give it a pull, and there we go, we have two very nice ovals. Now we can really get crazy"
Bob Ross,"Lets take, well go right back to our original color, and I know Im gonna get a letter or two or 100 that say I like that painting just the way it was and you went and messed it up"
Bob Ross,But when you do yours if this is where you want it to stop then thats exactly the place to stop it. I wanna just show you what you can do with it here though
Bob Ross,"Lets go right out here into this area and lets just let these bushes and stuff continue a little bit, lets see what happens. Just let em continue a little"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of blend em right into the ones that you have and there they go. There. Now, lets go back, let me put just a touch of the liquid white on my brush"
Bob Ross,"The liquid white is there only to thin the color. Only to thin it. And well take a little of our color, oh, thats nice, tap the bristles, tap em into the color. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets put a few little highlights up in here. All kinds of little things that are happening, just like so. There"
Bob Ross,"You know, its almost unreal to me with the completion of this series there will be over 230 Joy of Painting shows. Its a lot of shows, almost unreal to me"
Bob Ross,"And I hope youve had the opportunity to see em all if you want to. If you havent, give your station a call. Theyre donated to em free, so they can pick em up. Just let em know that you want em"
Bob Ross,"Cause if you dont let em know they dont know what you like and they like to hear from you. Tell you what, maybe down here theres a little bit of dirt"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take some Van Dyke brown, lets go right in here. Lets put a little brown in here. There. Something about like so, I dont know, whatever you want. Let it go on out here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, well take a fan brush, put a little bit of our yellows and greens and all those different colors on it, and lets go up in here and well just pop in just a few little happy grassy areas"
Bob Ross,"right along in here. Wherever you think they should be. There we go. See there. That creates a lot of depth in your painting, a lot of depth. There. Oh, I see something nice"
Bob Ross,"And you know what we oughta do, we got a minute or so left here, lets have some fun. I always get in trouble right at the end of the show"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a fan brush and fill it full of Van Dyke brown, put a lot of color, and maybe a little dark sienna too. A lot of paint, lot of paint in there"
Bob Ross,"And maybe in our world there lives, are you brave. This is your bravery test for today. There lives, yep, you guessed it, a big old tree that lives right there. Big old tree"
Bob Ross,"But hes a happy tree, so its alright. Maybe hes got a friend that comes right down like that. There. I know Im gonna get some letters about this now. Gonna get in trouble about this. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take, lets take, heres a little titanium white, pull it out flat, cut across, and lets go up here, barely touch, just let it barely touch"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this is just a big old birch tree that lives right up here. Barely touch. Pull it. Maybe theres a little on the other side too. Just like so, there. See there"
Bob Ross,"Now lets do some on the other side. There. But when youre pulling this pull it sort of around. And all youre doing is barely touching the canvas, dont wanna put too much pressure on it"
Bob Ross,"Barely, barely graze it. There. Now then, lets go in here with our, well use the old liner brush, paint thinner, and well put in a few limbs on this big old, big old tree here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres one right here, comes right out, right over like that. There. Okay, well give him another one there. Wherever you want em. Just wherever you want em. Put a few right in there, like so"
Bob Ross,"There we go. We dont have to do too many. Ill put a few leaves on here, but just enough so you can see the indication of some here and there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, we can take our brush with the dark color, go back, tap in a few little things, like so. And well highlight those a little. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, a little bit of the yellow, and lets come back in here and just put a few highlights on that. I hope youve enjoyed this one"
Bob Ross,"Its a very nice little painting, give you a lot of practice, and itll make you happy inside. The old clock on the wall tells me that its time to go, so well, think well call it a day"
Bob Ross,"Well call this one finished. From all of us, happy painting and God bless. gentle music"
Bob Ross,"- laughing Hi, welcome back. Im certainly glad you could join me today"
Bob Ross,"And I thought today wed just do a fantastic little painting, maybe sort of like a little fantasy painting, think youll enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"So I tell you what, lets have em start out, run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive done up here"
Bob Ross,"Today Ive taken a little black gesso on my standard ol 18 by 24 inch pre-stretched, double primed canvas, and Ive just sorta painted a little design right here"
Bob Ross,It just sorta goes around and right on into nothing there. Looks like a big eye or something right in the center
Bob Ross,"Now then, Ive let the black gesso dry completely, and then onto that, Ive taken a little bit, a very small amount of the liquid clear and covered the entire canvas. A very very small amount"
Bob Ross,"Then weve just made a mixture of alizarin crimson, little phthalo blue to make a lavender. And weve covered the entire canvas with it. And thats all we do"
Bob Ross,"The only reason I put the liquid clear on the top of the black gesso, is to make the application of the firm lavender color much much easier. Youll see that it really pays you great dividends"
Bob Ross,"And I thought today, thought today is such a fantastic day, that we just have a good time. So lets start out today with a little titanium white. Right on the ol two inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, get right in there with the big one. And well just load a little color onto the bristles. Just by tapping. Pull a little color out, well just tap it, sall you have to do"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go right up here. Now today, I wanna have a nice light shining right out of this area"
Bob Ross,"So were gonna start right in here with this very light paint, this pure white, and just begin working this outward. Just let it work outward. Just making like little criss-cross strokes right there"
Bob Ross,"This will be our light area in this painting. I wanna do a painting. I think in my mind I see a painting that. well, maybe theres big trees here and theres a stream of light coming through here"
Bob Ross,"Its just zinging right through there like that. And we can even take and pull it, and gives that impression already. But thats gonna be our light source in this painting"
Bob Ross,And these paintings can be done in a multitude of colors. Ive just picked lavender today because thats a nice color and its a nice day so I thought it would work well
Bob Ross,"But you can do em in phthalo blue, or sap green, or any of the transparent colors"
Bob Ross,"And if youre in doubt as to whether a color is transparent or not, take a little bit of it on your finger, just rub it on a black canvas"
Bob Ross,"If the canvas still looks black, then its transparent enough for what were doing. It may only be semi-transparent, but itll work for what were doing"
Bob Ross,"If you put it on here, like white for example, you put it on here and you can see the color, then its not transparent enough for what were doing. Okay, thats an easy way to try it out and see"
Bob Ross,"Lets wash our brush. Thats the fun part. Shake it off. laughing And just have a good time with it. Mm-kay, tell you what lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Lets have a little lavender, little phthalo blue, alizarin crimson, and well just sorta mix these on the brush"
Bob Ross,"I want this one, this lavender color, more to the red side, so well add more crimson than normal. There"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna tap a little color into the bristles, be right back, Im gonna get a little touch of white. I wanna lighten that even more. There, maybe even a little more of the reddish color"
Bob Ross,"Good, I like that. Tap a little color, right into the bristles. like so. Okay, lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back in here, we can make out the indication of some nice little trees that are hanging over here. So all we wanna do here is just put the indication of some beautiful little branches right here"
Bob Ross,I dont want this to get too dark cause itll ruin that illusion back there. There. And all were looking for is very basic little shapes. Were not looking for detail at this point
Bob Ross,"Just very, very basic little shapes. Maybe back in here you can see the indication of some very soft little things. Mm-kay. Now then, lets take our liner brush"
Bob Ross,"Well dip it in a little of the paint thinner. little paint thinner, and well go right into that same color. We want this to be thin, like water though. Thin as ink"
Bob Ross,"And turn the bristles when you pull em out. Thatll bring it to a very sharp point. See there. Okay, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then we can go back in here, and begin putting here and there, the indication of a few sticks and little limbs that you can see, little trunks. There, see"
Bob Ross,"Just drop those on, wherever you think they should live. Thats exactly where they should live. There. Wouldnt this be a perfect place for my little squirrel to live"
Bob Ross,"I hope youve got to see him during this series. Ive showed a couple of times. Actually its a she. But, beautiful little creature. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe right here we can see something thats a little bigger. Just sorta let your imagination go here. Now then. Lets take. wash the ol brush. Let me find another two inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Well take a two inch brush here, and I wanna make a very, very light lavender color. Very light. So Ill pick up a little of that lavender that we were using, go into the titanium white"
Bob Ross,"maybe even a little more of the crimson. Ooh, thats nice. Thats very nice. Or you could use a little touch of the bright red, lets have a little of that. Thats even better"
Bob Ross,"Now, tap the bristles, once again. That loads that little, little edge of paint right out on the tips of the bristle there. Just give it a tap, a little push. You can see that"
Bob Ross,"see that little ridge of paint comes up right there. Theres also a corresponding one on the bristles, and thats what we actually paint with"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can go up here, and the lights zinging through here, so we gonna have some very bright areas. There we go. Just tap em in. Mm, thats beautiful. And it works so easy"
Bob Ross,"All were using, is just the corner of the brush. Just the corner of the brush. See. And just begin thinking about all the little various little shapes here. There"
Bob Ross,"All kinds of nice things just sorta hanging around there. There we go. And you have to make a decision where they live, and how many there are, where they hang out at. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little more right there. Now that gives us a nice light area in this painting, right back in here. Very lightly, one hair and some air. blowing Just barely touch it"
Bob Ross,"You can pull over that to help create that illusion of light rays coming through there. But just barely, barely touch so you dont distort any of this that youve painted up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets go back into our lavender color, and well begin working forward with this. Just begin working forward"
Bob Ross,"Take a little of the lavender on the two inch brush, load it the same way, and maybe, we begin to see. some little tree shapes that are closer to us"
Bob Ross,All were doing right now is putting on some dark so our lightll show when we put it in there. There. This is the way we begin creating distance and depth in this painting
Bob Ross,And were not concerned with this side over here. All were looking for is this nice edge right here. At this point. Later on well be concerned with everything
Bob Ross,"But right now, thats all were interested in. Now then, lets take a little more of that light color, and as you notice, were working in layers"
Bob Ross,"Tap a little bit more of that light color onto the brush. Just tap it on there, maybe even pick up a little. there, little bit more of the phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"As it gets farther away from the light source, its gonna get a little darker, little more blue into it. There. Okay, lets go up here and try this. Now then, we can begin coming in here"
Bob Ross,"Ooh, thats nice. There. Isnt that fantastic though that you can a brush this big, and make something that looks that delicate. And you can, you really can. There we go"
Bob Ross,"These are beautiful paintings to give to, if you have a young friend, this is a super painting for a young friend. Because this looks like something right out of a fairy tale if you do it right"
Bob Ross,"And you could go back and add in any kind of little characters that you wanted to, whatever. Maybe, maybe theres gonna be a path down here"
Bob Ross,"So well begin hanging some nice grassy things that hang right over the edge of this path, just like so. And well come back and work on those a little in a minute"
Bob Ross,Right now all were doing is putting in some. basic ideas. There. Mm-kay. Lets go to the other side
Bob Ross,"Phthalo blue, alizarin crimson, and you can just mix these on the brush as you go, or you can mix up a pile when you first start. Either way, whichever is easiest"
Bob Ross,"Mm-kay, now, over here on the other side, lets come right up in here. Maybe theres some big trees here that are hanging over like this"
Bob Ross,"Now these are much darker, cause the light is coming from the other direction. These are very dark. And this darkness here, will make that light look even brighter"
Bob Ross,"The fact that this is so dark, see how that contrast just shows up. You can make some unbelievable effects like this playing light against dark, dark against light"
Bob Ross,"This black gesso, its got to be one of the most fantastic things that Ive ever came up with. There we go. It is unreal. Now then, on this side, I want these trees, as I say, be much much darker"
Bob Ross,"So lets take, lets take Well use the same ol brush that weve been using for highlights, but were gonna add a lot more of the blue, and the lavender, so its quite a bit darker"
Bob Ross,"Quite a bit darker. And once again, load the brush by giving a little push that creates that little ridge of paint. You can just see it pushing right up there"
Bob Ross,"If its not pushing up on your palette like this, chances are its also not on your bristles. So thats a good way to sorta test it"
Bob Ross,"I get a lot of letters asking about this, and this is the best way to test it, push. Give it little push, okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, with that little ridge of paint that weve built up there, now we can come up here and just begin putting in all kinds of little things. Well let em get darker and darker up in here"
Bob Ross,"There they come. Wherever you think they should be. There. Here comes a nice one. There it is, it hangs right out over here. Like so. Okay, maybe, and think about form and shape here"
Bob Ross,"Dont just throw these in at random. Think about em. Think about em. Maybe here comes another one that comes up, goes over. See, all these little things. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe right there, wherever you want em. This really is an individual thing. Look at your painting, because every single painting is gonna be different. Every ones gonna be different"
Bob Ross,"One thing that we try to teach you is not to copy, we only wanna teach you how to do a method of painting, a style of painting, and then turn you loose on the world"
Bob Ross,"Because once you know how to do it, then what you do becomes the joy of painting. Cause you can paint anything that makes you happy"
Bob Ross,"That brings joy to you, and to those that you care about, or those that are around you. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, I want to add a little touch more, maybe well add a little more crimson to that, just to change the taste a little bit. Still loading the brush, the same exact way though. Push. There we go"
Bob Ross,"See thats a beautiful closeup there. You can see that right up tight, exactly how its loaded. Little push, okay. Now then, right in here. we have some things that are hanging out"
Bob Ross,And I made these a little lighter because in my mind I think a little more light would strike right there. There we go. Little bit hanging right down there. Just all kinds of things
Bob Ross,"Maybe, up in here, I dont know. Wherever you think there might be some big bushes and trees and things growing, just sorta lay them in"
Bob Ross,"But these dark ridges, that were in here from the paintbrush, and I use a foam applicator brush just to put this black gesso on, these dark ridges here actually can become the walls if theres a"
Bob Ross,"little path here. Maybe theres, this is a recessed area. But you use these things that happen, dont fight em. All kinds of magic happens here. Alright. Now"
Bob Ross,"maybe on the other side here, look at where you think the light would zing through, and you can add a little bit of titanium white right there. Right out on the end of the bristles"
Bob Ross,"See and itll give the impression that lights just zinging right through there, hitting a few little things. Dont overdo though, or itll lose its effectiveness"
Bob Ross,"We want to create that illusion of light coming through. Maybe a little touch right out here. There we go. And thats about all we need there. Now then, lets go back to our liner brush"
Bob Ross,"splashing Well take the liner brush, little dark sienna. And once again, this paint is very thin. Its ink consistency. Okay lets go up in here. Maybe, in our world right here"
Bob Ross,"there lives a nice tree trunk that we can see. Now if you have trouble making the paint flow, all you have to do is add more of the paint thinner. If its not flowing, its only because its too thick"
Bob Ross,"Add a little paint thinner. Little more of the thinner. Alright. There. Few little branches and twigs, and all kinds of things happening. Shoot, maybe theres a"
Bob Ross,maybe theres a little stick that lives right there. I dont know. Wherever you want em. See em here. Just drop em in. Drop em in. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now we can take just a little bit of light paint, Im just using a little bit of titanium white, once again, think about where the light would zing through there, and we can add"
Bob Ross,"just the indication of a little highlight here and there where you think it would hit on this little trunk. And really pop it out, just make it stand right out. Maybe the lights gonna hit right here"
Bob Ross,"I dont know, sorta just look at your light source and make a determination where you think it would hit. There. Okay, this gives us splashing all kinds of little things happening in there"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe, in our world. maybe were beginning to see a little bit of green. So well take a little yellow, Im using the same ol dirty brush, little yellow, be right back, right back"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add a little black to it. Black and yellow. Make a beautiful green. Tap us a little color in there. Now maybe, maybe well add a little Van Dyke brown just to dull it, there"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe right in here, we have. look at that. There, see. All these things are just sorta hanging over here"
Bob Ross,"And just by changing the angle of the stroke here, you can create the illusion that things, that maybe this is the nice mossy things thatre hanging over the edge of a bank"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna tap the brush to the least little touch of red, bright red, and Indian yellow to make a nice orange. Maybe theres some nice little flowers on this bush. We dont know"
Bob Ross,"So see how easy you can put all kind of little things in there. Once again, it just sorta changes the flavor, and makes those nice things happen. Now then, time to get serious here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe up in here, lets go way up here. Maybe theres some big, overhanging tree limbs"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can just begin taking the brush, using just the corner, and begin shaping all of these beautiful limbs that hang over here"
Bob Ross,But really devote a little time to looking at the shape and the form that you put in here. Dont want to just throw em on at random. Dont just throw em up. Think about em
Bob Ross,"Think about the fact that theres limbs inside of this tree, maybe theres a big trunk over here that we cant see. And theres limbs in here. And each one of these limbs"
Bob Ross,"has a personality all of its own. Each one of em. There we go. But see how you can create that illusion, it looks like just huge, huge branches hanging over"
Bob Ross,"Now, if youve never painted before, this would be an ideal painting for your first attempt, because its probably one of the simplest paintings of this series, and it works. It works so well"
Bob Ross,"Very, very nice little painting to learn. Maybe here comes one all the way over. and right across like that. There, see. But just play with these little things and bring em together, work with em"
Bob Ross,"Be careful that you dont lose all your dark areas, cause if you lose all that dark, then youre gonna lose the illusion of this very subdued place, the very quiet place thats deep in the woods"
Bob Ross,"There. Tell you what, maybe right here, see. Let all these things just work out"
Bob Ross,"Now, little brighter yellow right here, because in my mind, theres gonna be a little more light right here, than there is back over here"
Bob Ross,"When youre back over here, we use a much darker, more subdued color. There. Okay, now then, lets come back out here, and lets use a color that has a little more of the bright in it"
Bob Ross,"Just let it work right over like that. There we go, sparkle it. And when we get back in these more recessed areas, a darker green. Mm. Does this make you wanna get your paintbrush out yet"
Bob Ross,"This one youll like. As I say, even if youve never painted, this is a beautiful little painting to do. We travel all over the country and teach classes and do demonstrations, and this is one that"
Bob Ross,that students love so well. There. But see whats happening down here. Already you begin to make out the illusion of a little path down here. We havent even painted anything here yet. We will
Bob Ross,"But at this point, all were doing, is just creating that illusion with big trees hanging over. Tell you what lets do. Shoot, this looks good. Take a little more of the midnight black"
Bob Ross,"Lets get some sap green in there too. Ooh, thats nice. Little bit of brown, be right back, there. I added some Van Dyke brown in there, only to dull it. Dulls the green down"
Bob Ross,"Now then, push that brush. Theres that little ridge of paint we talk about. There, just give it a little push. See, it works very well. Lets go back up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then maybe on this side theres some big trees too. Who knows. So, make a decision here. Drop em in. Here they come. See there. Just bring em, maybe they come right across over here"
Bob Ross,"And if you wanna make em stand out a little, add a little more of the bright color, and then theyll come right out, and theyll stand in front. Like so"
Bob Ross,See how that pushes that other layer of trees back. This is an excellent painting though to give you a lot of practice making all these beautiful things
Bob Ross,"But form and shape, I cant say that enough, are most, most important when doing this. Most important. And as I mentioned earlier, try not to kill all the dark area in here"
Bob Ross,"If you kill all this dark area, then youre gonna lose that distance. There. Hm. Isnt that fantastic"
Bob Ross,"You know I think I mentioned, earlier in the series, with the completion of this series therell be well over 230 shows. Son of a gun, cant believe"
Bob Ross,"and I sincerely appreciate the fact that you keep allowing me to come back into your home and bring you new shows, and new ideas. And its very special to all of us here"
Bob Ross,And Id like to thank you for that opportunity
Bob Ross,"And if youd like to keep seeing the shows, or youd like to see some of the ones that youve missed, give your station a call, let em know that youd like to see em"
Bob Ross,"Thats the only way they have of knowing that youre enjoying em. There. Maybe. right on down, wherever. Just sort of make a decision and drop em in here. where you think they should be"
Bob Ross,"I tell you what, lets have some fun. Maybe, maybe right in here. Maybe right in here. Lets take some, well take some Van Dyke brown"
Bob Ross,"Well just pull it out, very flat, cut us off a little roll of paint, pull it out as flat as you can get it, go straight down with the knife, zoop. And theres our little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a huge tree, huge tree, lives right here. faint whistling Well just put in some brown, straight Van Dyke brown. Maybe it goes right on up here. Maybe you can even see a little up here"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you think it should be. Its just straight ol Van Dyke brown. Now, well take some white, little Van Dyke, little dark sienna. mix em together"
Bob Ross,"but I want em marbled, I want the color to be very varied here. So, you dont end up with one color. See all the different color combinations"
Bob Ross,"Now when you cut off your little roll of paint, those variations will be right in there too. And lets go up in here, and just touch. and barely graze the canvas. There comes that big tree"
Bob Ross,"There he comes. Hes got a huge foot on him. And he needs that to hold him up, a tree this big. And this is just like laying snow on a mountain here. Just barely grazing the canvas. Barely grazing it"
Bob Ross,"Up here, maybe a little lights shining through. There. See how that, just by doing that though it gives the impression of bark. ol rough bark up here"
Bob Ross,"And, little bit of brown so we can dull it over here, we dont want this side to be as bright as that. So I just take a little brown, dull it down a little bit. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets take a fan brush with the least little of that brown and white on it, and lets go back in here. Just here and there. Put the indication maybe of a little path"
Bob Ross,"We dont want a lot of detail, too dark in here. And you bring that right on out. Create a beautiful little path. Back to our brush that has the green on it"
Bob Ross,"Hm, laughing and lets come down here and put a little bit of green, little grassy areas right along the foot of this big ol tree. Like so. Isnt this a fantastic little painting"
Bob Ross,"Once again, this is an excellent painting though, even if youve never painted before, you can make this one work, without any problem. And with that, I think were gonna call this one finished"
Bob Ross,"I hope youve enjoyed it, and I hope you try it. From all of us here, happy painting, and God bless, my friend. relaxing guitar music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, Im certainly glad you could join me today. Today I thought wed do just a fantastic little painting maybe something that has sort of a desert look to it. So Ill tell you what"
Bob Ross,Lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that youll need to paint along with me. And as usual theyll come across in the same order as I have them on my pallette
Bob Ross,Starting with the white and working around. But when you set your palette up Set it up any way that is convenient to you. So I tell you what Ive got my standard little 18x24 inch canvas up here
Bob Ross,"Weve covered it with a nice thin even coat of the Liquid white. Its all wet and ready to go. So lets just have some fun today. Lets start out today with a small, small amount of the Cad yellow"
Bob Ross,"This is Cadmium yellow, very small amount. Dont want much. Alright. And well make just a beautiful little sky up here"
Bob Ross,So lets take a little bit of this yellow and just put a little right up in here. Just using little criss cross strokes. Just little Xs. Little Xs. Like so. Now then
Bob Ross,Without cleaning the brush Im going right into a little bit of the Yellow Ochre. And same thing. Well just add a little bit of Yellow Ochre here just to give it a little flavor. Beautiful color
Bob Ross,And well just let this go wherever. Anything we dont want well just cover it up. So we dont worry about it. all your doing here is just putting in some beautiful little colors. There
Bob Ross,Maybe a little more right over in here. OK Now then. Lets have some fun. Let me wash the old brush. Thats always the highlight of this whole painting. There. Shake it off
Bob Ross,Laughs Just beat the devil out of it
Bob Ross,One of these days Im going to show you my camera men So youll know what they look like and youll understand why its so funny around here when we beat this brush. Tell you what
Bob Ross,Lets mix up a little bit of color here. Lets take some Alizarin Crimson. Well get a little Phthalo blue. I dont want much blue. I want this to be to the red side of lavender. Well pick it up
Bob Ross,Turn it over. Now then. Its very difficult to tell what color that is. Its very difficult. So lets put some white in it. Well add a little white in there. Very nice
Bob Ross,Thats just what Im looking for. There. Maybe even a little bit more crimson. Just depends on how you feel the day you paint it. Sometimes a little more to the reddish side
Bob Ross,Sometimes to the blueish side. Now lets take some of this and pull it out here into that. Im going to add a little Bright red. Make a firecracker out of it. Just let it go here
Bob Ross,Little bit of Bright red. And were going to take a little of that and add Yellow Ochre to it. So out of that one color now weve got three different things that are happening here
Bob Ross,We can vary back and forth and have a whole multitude of things that are happening right on the old brush here. So lets get a. well use a two inch brush today. What the heck
Bob Ross,Make sure its good and dry and lets start this first color of lavender. And well just put a little paint on the brush. There we are. Just a little. It doesnt take much. OK. Lets go right up here
Bob Ross,And maybe in our world there lives right here just a happy little cloud. Now just using the corner of the brush and just sort of twisting it up. Making little tiny circles
Bob Ross,There and just let this cloud sort of go wherever you think it should be. There we go. And all were doing is just applying color at this point
Bob Ross,We will come back in and blend and bring this all together. There. But I want to make a very effective little sky. One thats bright and shiny. Makes you happy to look at it
Bob Ross,Maybe theres a little doer that hangs down right here. Whatever. Shoot. Maybe hes got a little arm out here. Whatever you want. Clouds are very free
Bob Ross,They just sort of float around and have fun all day. And you can make all kinds of little beautiful shapes and designs
Bob Ross,If your like me when I was a kid I used to sit out and look at clouds and pick out all kinds of shapes. And when your painting them you can do the same thing
Bob Ross,You can create the illusion of just all kinds of beautiful little things that are happening. There we go. The tiny little circles. singing Tiny little circles. There you go
Bob Ross,Now you see why I took up painting rather than singing. OK. Maybe even a little down here. Wherever. Wherever. Its a very free form of painting
Bob Ross,Lets go over to the other side here and put one right up in here. We dont want him left out. But Im still just using the corner of the brush. Thats all were using here
Bob Ross,Just the corner of the brush. There. OK. Now Im going to go into some of those other colors that we made. And just add a little bit of those different colors here and there
Bob Ross,Just to change the flavor a little. OK Now then. Maybe in our world maybe theres a nice little cloud that floats around right out here. Wherever you think he should live. There he goes
Bob Ross,But all were doing is just putting in the basic shapes right now. Well come back and blend this. When your doing this if this doesnt look to hot at this point dont worry about it
Bob Ross,Dont worry about it because were going to make it all better. Thats what my mother used to tell me when I was sick. Shed say wed make it all better and she always did. She always did
Bob Ross,And even today she still makes it all better when I dont feel well. Mothers are like that. The best people in the world. There. OK. That ought to give us enough clouds to play with
Bob Ross,Well wash our old brush again. I just want to get even with the camera people. They hassle me. There. laughs We got em that time. Now then
Bob Ross,"Lets go right up here with a clean, dry brush and just blend. Now were just going to be bringing all this together. Be sure your brush is very clean and very dry"
Bob Ross,You can blend right over the top of it. Just like that. and watch how it will come together. See there. Anything that we were worried about now we dont have to worry about it
Bob Ross,Just blend them together. And if you want em softer just wind em up. Do little tiny circles like that and it will just blend it right into the base color and it will all come together. There
Bob Ross,Just even pull that paint. Because this is wet you can move color. Is this was a dry canvas youd have a very difficult time making this work
Bob Ross,"But since its nice and wet, it has the Liquid white on the canvas you can create these illusions. You can move paint. There"
Bob Ross,See those clouds that we were sort of worried about now theyre very striking clouds. There we go. Now just blend this one out a little in places. In other places Im going to leave it quite firm
Bob Ross,So theres all types of things happening in there. Theres action happening. Its not just a dead old cloud laying up here. There we go. And then very lightly well just blend it all together
Bob Ross,Isnt that a fantastic way of making in a sky that is just. oh. Its unreal. Now then. Maybe we want to add. We really want to add a little sparkle to it
Bob Ross,Lets take a little Titanium white on the fan brush. Go right up here. Maybe right into here we want to have some light. Right under this beautiful little area right here
Bob Ross,So all you have to do is take a little white. Place it in there. Shoot. Who knows. Maybe theres a little shoo in from right up here. There. Just let it blend right on out. Like so
Bob Ross,"Now with a clean, and very dry brush we can go back in here and gently blend that out. Thatll give us a beautiful light spot in the sky. There"
Bob Ross,The paint were using is very firm so you can do all this blending and get away with it. If it was a soft paint you would be in agony city all ready. But there we go
Bob Ross,But doesnt that make a nice little bright spot in the sky. I knew you could do that without any problem. Shoot were having so much fun with the fan brush. Lets just keep on with it. There we go
Bob Ross,"Lets take the color that we made the cloud out of. The first color we mixed is basically just Alizarin crimson, Phthalo blue and a little touch of white. Grab a little more white"
Bob Ross,I want to lighten that up a little more. Im looking for a color thats very close to the cloud color. OK. Lets go up here. You can sort of hold your brush up here and check it
Bob Ross,If its not just right then you can change your mind. Lets go right in here. Maybe in our world there lives a little mountain back in here. Like that
Bob Ross,But I want this to be almost the same color as the clouds so it just hides back in. Now with this fan brush you can put all kinds of little points and stuff like that on your mountain. There
Bob Ross,"Very, subdued though. Like so. There. Youve gotta be very quiet with it. OK. Now well take a 2 inch brush and Im going to grab this and just begin pulling it"
Bob Ross,Now this is where you create the basic shape of your mountain. Just with brush strokes. Brush strokes. Thats the name for our newsletter. There we are. OK. Just give it a pull
Bob Ross,Over here were going to sort of pull it in this direction. See how those angles are changing though
Bob Ross,And just by doing that you can create the illusion of a nice little mountain that lives way back here. There
Bob Ross,And you can go back with a little of the darker color and here and there put in the indication of some little things that are happening back in here
Bob Ross,Dont want too much in this one though because its too far away. You put too much in here youre going to loose that wonderful illusion of distance. So be careful
Bob Ross,"Now at the base, if we want to create mist, Let me grab another brush. I have several going here. All we do is tap"
Bob Ross,Allow it to blend with the Liquid white thats on the canvas and automatically it will create that illusion of mist. Alright. Now then maybe theres several layers of these
Bob Ross,So lets have another one here. Go back into that same color and Im going to add the least little touch of Phthalo blue to it. Least little touch. I dont want much. Not much. Just a little. OK
Bob Ross,"Lets go back up in here. OK. Lets come right in here. Maybe, right here this time, lives our little. There you can see it"
Bob Ross,"But see just use the corner of the fan brush and youll be surprised with the amount of detail you can get in there. Maybe this comes down, comes right over here. I dont know"
Bob Ross,Wherever you want it to go. Just drop it in. There. This reminds me of some of the beautiful scenes that I saw when I was visiting my friends in Mexico. It is beautiful there. Absolutely beautiful
Bob Ross,If youve never been to Mexico you really should go. Some of the most beautiful mountains I think Ive ever seen. And some of the nicest people Ive ever met. Maybe well pull that one over a little
Bob Ross,"See you can change your mind. And well just let it disappear right on over into here. Wherever you want. Go back to our big brush. You want to grab this, pull it. Pull it firmly"
Bob Ross,Think about the angles that you want in here though. Just the brush strokes are all you need to create the illusion of some beautiful distant mountains. There
Bob Ross,"Maybe and this one is a little closer to us. So maybe, maybe we want to put a little more detail in it. So Ill take a little bit of that same color on the fan brush"
Bob Ross,A little Phthalo blue and whatever we had going here. OK. Now then. Maybe here and there theres just some happy little things in here
Bob Ross,So just put in some basic indications and well come back and well blend em a little bit. Just think about all the little shapes and things that are happening
Bob Ross,"And you can create all kinds of beautiful, beautiful effects. Its as easy as that. There. Now then"
Bob Ross,"Back to our big brush and very lightly, very lightly well just tap and blend until we get it just the way that we want it. But try this and play with it. Youll be surprised at what you can do"
Bob Ross,"Youll be absolutely amazed at the effects you can achieve. And you can do it. You can do anything, anything that you believe you can do. Anything that you believe you can do. You can do it. Alright"
Bob Ross,Tell you what. This is that much fun. Lets put one more range in there than lets quit. I just enjoy doing this. Take the same color. Add a little bit more of the Phthalo blue
Bob Ross,And lets come right along in here. Maybe this one comes from right here. See that back one now is almost to the point where you cant hardly make it out. Its almost gone
Bob Ross,Do not want much detail back here. There. Maybe the bump there. Wherever you want em. Just sort of look at em. Now if you live someplace that has beautiful mountains like this
Bob Ross,Like in Mexico or the Southwest. Shoot. You can just look out your window. You have the advantage over the rest of us. Look out your window and paint some of these beautiful scenes. There we go
Bob Ross,All were doing here is just applying a little bit of color. Little bit of color. Now. Once again. With our old big brush. Grab it and pull down. Pull down but very firmly
Bob Ross,Youre moving this paint right on the canvas. There we go little bit there. And wherever. Wherever. Now we can go back
Bob Ross,Take our fan brush with some of that same color and lets begin adding all kinds of beautiful little details in here. There. And just pick em out. Just pick em out
Bob Ross,You can use the side of the fan brush or you can use it flat depending on the effect that you want. Practice a little and you can create beautiful things with a fan brush
Bob Ross,You can do entire paintings with a fan brush. Its just a very versatile tool. It works good too. There. OK. Maybe right over here just a little bit. Alright. Back to our large brush
Bob Ross,"And very gently just blend that a little and bring it all together. As I say, this is one of the easiest ways that Ive ever seen of making this type of little mountain formation. There"
Bob Ross,Now you can continue to blend this until all of these little things that youve painted in here go away and it just becomes solid again. So if you ever make a mistake and your unhappy with it
Bob Ross,Of course we dont make mistakes. We just have happy accidents. But should you have something that your unhappy with. You can just keep blending it until it goes away
Bob Ross,"It can just go away and leave you. There we are. OK. Very soft at the base. You want it to be very, very soft"
Bob Ross,But look at the amount of distance we have here because we have all these different plains. Even up into the sky
Bob Ross,Theres a lot of different plains and that creates the illusion of distance in your world. Shoot were about to cover up the whole canvas here with just sky and mountains
Bob Ross,"Lets do something down toward the bottom here. Lets take, lets take, lets take. I tell you what I want to mix up another color"
Bob Ross,"One of the most beautiful browns that you can make is made from Alizarin crimson and Sap green. In about equal parts. About equal parts. But it makes a beautiful, beautiful brown"
Bob Ross,I use it a great deal when Im painting. There. OK. Tell you what. Let me clean off the old knife. And we just wipe the knife on a paper towel. And well go right into that
Bob Ross,Well take a little bit of that color. There. And lets go right go right up here. Lets just paint in this. We need some nice ground areas. And will just paint it in. But isnt that a beautiful color
Bob Ross,Beautiful color and its Alizarin crimson and Sap green. If you take Alizarin crimson and mix it with Phthalo green than you get a beautiful black. A very transparent and beautiful black. Now maybe
Bob Ross,Ill tell you what. Youd want to go back and look at these beautiful mountains back in here. And to do that youd need a way to get back there. You would have to have a way to get back there
Bob Ross,"So lets take. Wed use the old fan brush. Im going to go right into a little Van Dyke brown. Just a little. Just a little. And maybe, maybe in our world, maybe theres a road that goes back there"
Bob Ross,Well put the road in and then well work around it. But notice that it gets bigger toward the front than it is back here. Thats what makes it look like its going away. There
Bob Ross,OK Maybe this is a big road. Alright well take a big brush and lets just blend it in now. But Im using little rocking strokes. I want this to look like an indentation
Bob Ross,Maybe theres been some jeeps and stuff thats went down here. They built a road. There. People had to come out and take a look at all the beautiful scenery here
Bob Ross,Just a little indentation and well just let it disappear right on back into nothing. We dont know where it goes back here. Dont know that we really care. There
Bob Ross,"And that gives us the first step of our little road. Ok. I think today Ill use a, Ill use a one inch brush. Lets go into a little black, a little black, a little black. Maybe a little brown"
Bob Ross,A little Alizarin crimson. There we are. Just tap a little color in there. And lets go up here and maybe there are some nice little trees and stuff here that grow
Bob Ross,"And im just taking the one inch brush and just tapping in some very basic shape. Maybe well make, I think their called smoke trees, maybe well make some of those back here"
Bob Ross,All were doing right now is putting in a little dark so our light will show. Little dark. You have to have a little dark to make the light show. Thats just like in life
Bob Ross,If you never had any sadness in your life than you wouldnt know the happy times when they came. Its the reason God gives us those little sad times. That way we know when we got a good one. There
Bob Ross,"Alright. Maybe, maybe even down in here. I dont know. Were really not committed at this point. We can put in just any old thing that we want wherever we want it. OK. Lets go"
Bob Ross,Tell you what maybe right here. Maybe theres a nice tree right here. A big un. And a few little things that live in here
Bob Ross,When your doing your painting just sort of make up little stories and put these things right in wherever you want em. Wherever you think they should live. And thats where they should be
Bob Ross,Maybe a few little things down here. There we go. Alright. Lets take another one inch brush. I have several of them going. Im going to dip the brush into the least little amount of the Liquid white
Bob Ross,"Thats only to thin the paint. Well pull out a little Titanium white. Reach up here. And well get a little bit of the Phthalo blue. This is Phthalo blue, a little Liquid white. Titanium white"
Bob Ross,Well just tap the bristles straight into that. OK. Lets go up here. Now then. Lets come up here and just tap in some highlights. Just tap em in
Bob Ross,Thinking about form and shape and all those little things. Theres one back here. We just let these disappear right on back into nothing so it looks like distance. There we go
Bob Ross,Isnt that beautiful though. There. Little trees living way back in here. Theres another one. Wherever you want him. Wherever you want him. There. Heres a nice one. Hes a nice one. Or she
Bob Ross,Maybe this is a she tree. Or maybe its two or three trees. Maybe its a whole family of trees. Its up to you. See as you start telling little stories though now I see a whole bunch of trees there
Bob Ross,Theres another one. Another one. There you can just make all the trees that you want. Lets go back on the other side over here. Maybe over in here theres one lives right here. And another one there
Bob Ross,Just wherever but look at form and shape. Dont just hit it random. Wherever. There we go
Bob Ross,"And this is a very, very, nice, easy, simple way of creating these little smoke trees or whatever you want to call em. Very effectively we take a little lavender here and there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe here and there, ooh theres a nice one, a little lavender color. OK Now then well go back to our fan brush. It has a little bit of white paint on it"
Bob Ross,And lets just begin bringing all this together. There we go. Clean up the bottom. This is a nice way of just smoothing it out. Bringing it together. Over in here. RIght down to the edge of the road
Bob Ross,There. Pull it right on down. See there and well pick up a little touch of the dark paint. Put right under here. Like so. Just to show where the road and everthing comes together. Now then
Bob Ross,"Lets have some fun. Shoot. Lets take a little black. Little black. Maybe right in here, lets just tap in a little doer like that. And well give him a little friend"
Bob Ross,Maybe right over here well have another one. Wherever you want em. Just drop in some little things. Im going to take a liner brush today. Liner brush. A lot of paint there on it
Bob Ross,"And Im going to go right into a little more of the paint thinner. Green, a little black, a little touch of the yellow. And lets just do something like this. Just like so"
Bob Ross,But if you have trouble making your paint flow as youve heard me say over and over just add a little bit more of the paint thinner. Its all you need. Maybe up here well put some nice things like so
Bob Ross,Maybe this is an old Yucca plant or something. But Im just going back and forth between the blacks and the greens. A little bit of yellow. Put some nice old arms sticking out here on him. There
Bob Ross,And same thing here. We need some nice things going out here. There. A few right down here. See there. And a couple on this one over here and well about have a finished painting
Bob Ross,Dont want this one left out. OK And Ill tell you what. As I close out here Lets just put a little tree right here. We need a little dead tree. And well call this one finished with this. There
Bob Ross,I hope youve enjoyed this. This will give you an idea of how to make a very effective little desert scene. From all of us happy painting and God bless. theme music
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today. This is the last show of the 18th series, so I thought today wed just do a fantastic little painting, and I think itll make you happy"
Bob Ross,"I tell you what, lets start out, have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me. While theyre doing that, let me show you what I was doing when I got caught here"
Bob Ross,"Today I have my ol standard 18 by 24 inch canvas up here. Ive covered the top of it with liquid white, bout down to so. And now the bottom Im just putting a little of liquid black on"
Bob Ross,"Now I thought today maybe well do some, well, lets see, maybe well just do a beautiful, little painting that has maybe some little woodsy things here, and I dont know, lets just have some fun,"
Bob Ross,"and see what happens. Now while we have this brush with the liquid black on it, lets just go up in here and just tap in some very basic little shapes"
Bob Ross,"Maybe some little bushes and stuff that live far back here in the distance. Just some very basic shapes. And these, they will sort of show through, after we get everything done"
Bob Ross,"And itll make it look like theres trees far, far away, that you cant hardly see. Very distant little trees"
Bob Ross,"And you can just use the side of the brush like this, and make some very nice little shapes. Or you can use it like this, and just turn it to create all kinds of little illusions"
Bob Ross,"Whatever works the easiest for ya. Try em both, and see which one you like. There we go. Mm-kay. Well wash the ol brush. Just get it cleaned out here. Shake it off"
Bob Ross,"thwacking chuckles I just beat the devil out of it. Now then, I thought today, lets have some, lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Lets start off with a little bit of yellow ochre, right on the ol two inch brush here. Just a little bit of yellow ochre. We dont need a great deal. There. Mm-kay. Tap the bristles in there"
Bob Ross,"That assures a nice, even distribution of color all the way through the bristles. See how even that is. Kay, lets go up here. Maybe today lets put a little sun up here. I like to do little suns"
Bob Ross,"The first advice I would give you is dont put it right dead in the center of the canvas, put it to one side or the other. But not right in the center"
Bob Ross,"Kay, well just start off here and lay in a little color just using little criss-cross strokes. Something about like so. And just work that around and around. Maybe out to about there. Wherever. Kay"
Bob Ross,"Now then. Now then, lets take and wash the ol brush off again. thwacking chuckles All right, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take a little alizarin crimson, nice reddish color, and tap a little of that right on the two inch brush, kay"
Bob Ross,"Now right around the yellow here, Im gonna put a little bit of this alizarin crimson. Like so. But Im still using little criss-cross strokes"
Bob Ross,"And by using those little criss-cross strokes, youll find that it is much, much easier to blend this together when we start blending. Rather than just drawing a big circle around there"
Bob Ross,"All these little loose lines here, are much easier to blend together than one big solid line. There. Kay, now. Somethin like so. Looks like a big smiley face already. So that makes us happy"
Bob Ross,"So this is gonna be a happy painting. All right, we like things that are happy here. Tell you what lets do, lets take alizarin crimson and a little touch of the phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"But mostly alizarin crimson, the blue is much, much stronger. Much stronger. And we just mix these on the brush. What the heck, it doesnt matter. Any way that makes you happy. Lets go back up here"
Bob Ross,"Now right around the crimson, well take a little bit of this phthalo blue and alizarin crimson mixture, and just bring it right around. There. Like so. Int that fantastic. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna let it blend right down into these little liquid black shapes that we made. And believe it or not, some of them will show through"
Bob Ross,"If you dont rub em too hard some of them will still show way back in the background. And if you do rub em away, you can go back and just tap in a few more, right over the top of the color"
Bob Ross,"Either way, doesnt matter. Or you can just leave em out. Now then. Tell you what, lets clean the brush, one more time. And we can begin blending all those colors together. Shake it off"
Bob Ross,"thwacking chuckles And just beat the devil out of it. Now then, I wanna take this clean, dry brush, and be sure its dry. Be sure its dry and just begin blending this all together"
Bob Ross,"Start from the yellow area and work outward, because thats the weakest color. There. And try not to take this dirty, contaminated brush back up here into the center"
Bob Ross,"If you do, youre gonna lose your nice color up here. But were still using all those little criss-cross strokes. And thatll just blend it right together. There"
Bob Ross,"You know weve got so many letters, in some of the earlier shows I showed my little squirrel thwacking that lives with me"
Bob Ross,"And weve got literally hundreds of letters and calls about the little rascal. So I thought Id show him one more time, since this is the last show"
Bob Ross,"And just let you see this little rascal and see if you like him half as much as we do. This is what he looked like when Annette and I first got him. He looked chuckles like a little, drowned rat"
Bob Ross,And this is what he looks like today. He is one of the most precious little creatures to me. And he lives in the house with me
Bob Ross,"Sort of runs around, tears everything up, But hes right on the verge of being at the age where I have to turn him loose. Cause its, hes ready to go free now. Go live with his own kind"
Bob Ross,"He just puts up with ol bushy-haired guy so long, and then hes ready to go back. But hes very special to me. Very special. And I hope you, hope you enjoyed seein that little devil"
Bob Ross,"All I been doin here is just blending this, so its very soft. Now then. thwacking Well clean that brush one more time. I wanna brighten this guy, just a little bit more"
Bob Ross,thwacking Cause I really want this guy to stand out really strong. Want it to be an eye grabber. So Im gonna take and go right into titanium white. Just plain ol titanium white
Bob Ross,"And Ill go right back up here, and start working it around. Just plain titanium white. Now its gonna pick up all the colors that we have on the canvas, and its gonna brighten everything"
Bob Ross,"Now you can do this over, and over, and over, and make it as bright as you want. There we go. But now you can spend quite a bit of time here just blending this"
Bob Ross,"You cannot believe how smooth, beautiful you can make this. It just, its unreal what you can do"
Bob Ross,"And you wanna blend it, til where you step back from the canvas, you cant see where one color stops and the next color starts. There we go. Now we just take out the brush marks. Like so"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe we wanna put a sun up here. So Ill just take my finger. Shoot, well do finger painting today. Decide where you want the sun to live. Maybe its gonna live right here"
Bob Ross,"And just make a little round circle. Preferably a circle. Huh, those square suns, people sort of look at em funny. So, I suggest you make a little round one here"
Bob Ross,"thwacking Then, very lightly, very lightly, you can just blend it all together. There. And the more you blend it, the softer itll become, until it literally just disappears, if you want it to"
Bob Ross,"There, very lightly. Well go over the entire canvas, just to remove brush strokes and get it ready. Mm-kay. Lets wash the ol brush"
Bob Ross,"Wash the ol brush, thats the, thats the most fun part of this whole procedure, is washing the brush. Because as Ive mentioned to you, chuckles my camera people dont think much of this procedure"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes they get a little upset with me. In fact, I tell you what, Im gonna ask them to turn the camera around and let you see. This is Richard"
Bob Ross,"And Richards been with me thwacking chuckles since the first series. And as you can see, Richard has finally got smart, and he now wears a raincoat"
Bob Ross,"He got tired of all of his clothes bein painted. So, we appreciate his, all of his work, though, that hes done with us and the fact that he stays with us even though hes got splashed. There. Now"
Bob Ross,"Im wanna go back with a little bit of this liquid black and maybe just put in a few indications. I wipe most of mine out, too. Believe it or not, a few of em would still show through"
Bob Ross,"But for the purposes of television here, well make em a little more distinct, so you can see em. Now maybe. Lets take a little, little bit of the phthalo blue, little touch of crimson"
Bob Ross,"And, lets just go right in here, and well put a little color down here. Right over the liquid black. Just a little bit of color. Let it blend right up into basically nothing. There"
Bob Ross,Maybe back in here were beginning to see some trees and bushes that are a little more distinct. There they are. Get a little more color. Just begin putting in some very basic little shapes
Bob Ross,Were not looking for a lot of detail yet. Just very basic shapes. And all were using is just the corner of the brush. Nothing else. Theres a nice big one standin right up here. See there
Bob Ross,"Little more paint. And this is just alizarin crimson, phthalo blue. There. A little touch more maybe over in here. Lets just have another happy little bush that lives here"
Bob Ross,But I dont want to kill all those ones that we made with the liquid black. We want to leave those back there
Bob Ross,"And theyll show through, and theyll look like things that are very, very distant and sort of hidden in the mist back here"
Bob Ross,"Now liquid black is excellent when you want to do paintings that you want to look very misty and very, very soft"
Bob Ross,"Because the black will mix with everything that you put on here now, and it creates that illusion of softness. And sometimes, sometimes thats extremely desirable. I like paintings that are very soft"
Bob Ross,"For television purposes, a lot of times, we paint the paintings quite bright, because everybodys set is adjusted just a little different, so we want the color to look well"
Bob Ross,"But when Im at home painting, I paint paintings that are extremely, extremely soft. Almost look like watercolors. And this is an excellent way to do that using the liquid black"
Bob Ross,Ive taken a little paint thinner on the brush here. Little bit of the lavender color. We just put the indication here and there of some little tree trunks that live back here
Bob Ross,"Were not lookin for a lot of detail. Were gonna highlight these, most of it will be covered up. There. But you always have little sticks and twigs that are hangin around out here and playin"
Bob Ross,The little squirrel has to have a place to come and sit. I really hope youve enjoyed seein the little squirrel in this series. Hes very special to me. There
Bob Ross,"As I say Annette and I raised him from a little, tiny thing. His eyes werent even open when we got him. Couple of my neighbors, Terry and Marie, brought him over when he was the tiniest, little thing"
Bob Ross,"He had fell out of a tree and a kitty cat had got him. And they rescued him, brought him over. And we raised him. By the time you see this, hell probably be long gone. Back to nature"
Bob Ross,Hell probably have a family. Couple of kids of his own. Car payments. All those things that we all have. There we go. Now we got a few little sticks and twigs in there
Bob Ross,"Well just use the same ol dirty brush, it doesnt matter. Go right into yellow, get a little sap green. Maybe even a little brown to dull it down. Oh, there we go, thats nice. Thats nice"
Bob Ross,"Tap a little bit into the bristle. Im gonna get a little yellow ochre, too. There. Little bit of yellow ochre. Kay and lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, begin picking out little individual things here. Theres a happy little tree that lives right there. See him. There he is. Kay. Maybe right heres another one. Absolutely, you knew that"
Bob Ross,"You knew there was gonna be a tree there. There. Mm-kay, maybe right over here on this one. Then well just put all kinds of little leaves and just foliage everywhere. Everywhere"
Bob Ross,"Get a little more of the sap green, come right in here. Theres a nice one. He was hidin back here in the background. We had to pull him out"
Bob Ross,"Every once in awhile maybe a little touch of the Indian yellow and little touch of bright red. Well sparkle it up. Oh, thats pretty. Thats pretty. These kind of colors just make you feel good"
Bob Ross,They make you feel good. And thats what paintings all about. Should make you feel good inside when you paint. There
Bob Ross,"And the most pleasure of all in painting, is sharing your painting with other people, you know. The fact, do a painting, and give it to a friend"
Bob Ross,"Its the most fantastic feeling that somebody, and when they go, Ooh and Ah and they say, You didnt paint this.  Thats, huh, because they wont believe you painted it. They will not believe it"
Bob Ross,"And that maybe the nicest thing, of this whole thing is just sharing what you can do with other people. There we go. Now, maybe. Maybe back in here"
Bob Ross,Lets begin making maybe some little grassy areas that live back in here. Wherever. And all were doing is tapping down with the greens and yellows. But see how subdued and soft this looks
Bob Ross,"Thats because of the liquid black on the canvas. This will look very, very soft. Now if you use the black gesso, you could get the same idea but itll look totally and completely different"
Bob Ross,Dont get black gesso and liquid black confused. Black gesso is a acrylic paint. Its a primer that goes on the canvas. Liquid black is an oil based paint. Its very slow drying
Bob Ross,Where as gesso dries very quickly. There. Mm-kay. You can put the gesso on it and probably in about 30 minutes youre ready to go. The liquid black is designed to stay wet through the entire painting
Bob Ross,"Mm-kay, maybe. Maybe right in there. Wherever, wherever. We can just put all kinds of happy, little things in there"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, that just looks like a perfect place to me, but lets do it, lets do it. In my mind, I see a happy little stream lives back here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna dip the brush into a little bit, a little bit of the liquid white, and go right into titanium white. Just pull the brush through. Maybe the least, least little touch of phthalo blue in there"
Bob Ross,"Least little touch. Just enough to give it a little hint of color. Okay, lets go back up here. Now then maybe our little stream, it comes from back here. So we dont know where it comes from"
Bob Ross,"Comes around the corner there. Maybe theres a little waterfall right there. Bloop. Push upward with the brush. Just push is upward. Like so, there. Kay. There it comes"
Bob Ross,"Streams are so much fun to make with this. And it comes right here, bloop, and falls over. And theres all kinds of little rocks and stuff underneath here that we cant see"
Bob Ross,So just use your imagination and decide where you think there might be a rock living underneath and it causes the water to do all kinds of beautiful things
Bob Ross,Sometimes just for no reason it looks like on top therell be a little bloop like that. And theres just a rock under there. Or a big stone
Bob Ross,"And sometimes when your little streams just meandering along there and having fun and playing, itll come along, and somewhere somebody pulled out pew, there it went, pulled out all the stops"
Bob Ross,"And it slid right off. Maybe theres big one or something right there. Now watch here, watch here. Take a little bit of the liquid white, well put it up here, maybe a little more"
Bob Ross,"To that Im gonna add the least, little touch of dark sienna. Maybe a little more. And we just want to make a pile of very thin paint thats light brown"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna make a pile and just pile it up like that. Now then. Lets take, well use the ol filbert brush today. Well go right into brown, put it on both sides"
Bob Ross,"Then well go down to this very thin paint, with the light brown in it, and just wipe through. So, on one side, theres light, and the other side is dark. See there. Kay, lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Now there maybe back here in our world, there lives some little stones. But this way you can make the highlight and the shadow of the stones both, in one stroke. That easy"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe theres stones all over the place. We dont know. Wherever you want em. This is a super way of making a lot of little stones very rapidly. Little more of the color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe down in here, shoot. Maybe theres a big stone here. Thats why theres a waterfall. Maybe it comes around and all the way over. We dont know where it is"
Bob Ross,"Just make up your mind where you want it, and drop it in. In fact, sometimes, theres even stones in the waterfall. And we can do that, too. That easy"
Bob Ross,"We can put a happy, little stone right in the waterfall. Then well go back to our fan brush, and bring some water, ploop, right over on this side. See there"
Bob Ross,"And we let this water come right in front of the rock, pew. But you see how now theres a little water goin behind the rock and some goin in front"
Bob Ross,"And when it hits down here, needless to say, its gonna splash. Push upward with the brush and get that nice splash and the foam and all the churning and carrying on that goes on down here"
Bob Ross,"There it goes makes splashing noise over here. Gotta make those little noises, though"
Bob Ross,"Course, people look at you a little weird when youre painting and you make all these funny little noises but thats all right. Painters are expected to be a little different"
Bob Ross,So use your artists license. Your artists license comes with your first tube of paint. And it says youre a painter. You can do weird things and you can paint anything that you want on canvas
Bob Ross,"You can create your own world. Now maybe, lets grab another brush. Maybe over here on this side, lets go over here. Lets take a little, a little black, a little crimson, little brown, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"All on the two inch brush. Just tap a little color into it. Maybe, maybe over here. Maybe right here. We dont care. Maybe theres some big bushes that live over here"
Bob Ross,"Somewhere, right there, there they are. And well bring em all the way out. Maybe thats what holds the waterfall in here. Comes way out like that"
Bob Ross,"But, see, this creates another plane and pushes that waterfall way back in the distance. There. All were doing now is putting down some dark, so our light color will show when we put it on here"
Bob Ross,"Its the only reason were using this dark, is to cover up over the waterfall so it pushes it back. There"
Bob Ross,"Mm-kay then Ill go back to my other two inch brush that we had our greens and yellows and all that on. There. Tap in a little bit of color. But, push that paint"
Bob Ross,"You can see that little ridge right there. Thats most important. Lets go right up here. Now then, make some big decisions here. Where do you, where do you want the highlights on this"
Bob Ross,"Maybe it comes right about here. And just begin dropping in all these little things. And you can vary the colors a little bit. Maybe theres a little yellow ochre, right there. Little yellow ochre"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Little bit more. And let the light, or the highlights, come out a little bit past the dark area. That keeps the shadows inside the bush"
Bob Ross,"You dont want the shadows on the outside, doesnt look just right. Shadows are normally inside the bush. There we go. Heres another one. Wherever you want em. As many or as few"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of look at the basic shape that you dropped in. And from that, then you can create all kinds of things. Maybe it just, shoot, look right there. Gotta have a rock here"
Bob Ross,"Looks like a rock place. Right here. Aaroomp, theres a big ol rock that lives right there. Shoot, there might even be a, maybe theres a flat rock down here at the bottom. We dont know"
Bob Ross,"Doesnt matter. Whatever. Whatever. There. Tap in a few little bushes around here. All right. Then we just take the knife, scrape in the indication here and there of a stick and a twig"
Bob Ross,"On the other side over here, maybe well put somethin over here, too. Maybe theres a happy little bush that lives right here. And it grows right down to about there. Wherever"
Bob Ross,Back to our brush with the highlight color. Throw some happy little leaves up here on this one. Little bit right in there. See. They just live right here in your brush
Bob Ross,"All you gotta do is sort of shake em out. Let some of these bushes hang right over almost into the water. There, back to our fan brush. Put a little water around the bottom of these"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, we got it made there. Tell you what, chuckles we got a minute or so left here, lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, you know me and my big trees, maybe, yep, chuckles maybe theres a big tree that lives right up here. And all were doin is droppin in some dark here. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"Thats all were doin. Just droppin in some base color. We dont want to cover up our sun. Well come, maybe well just come close to it and let it go at that. There. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Maybe some on the other side, too. We dont want it left out. Its just sort of a nice way just to bring it all together here. There we go"
Bob Ross,"With the ol two inch brush it doesnt take long to drop in a whole bunch of stuff. There we are. See there. Theres another one. Shoot, who knows"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a, maybe theres a little tree that lives right out here. Well put some leaves in. Then well come back and put a trunk right there. Well make a tree right there"
Bob Ross,We can do anything that we want here. Any old thing. There. Kay. That sort of just brings the whole thing together. Lets take a liner brush. Lot of paint thinner on it. There we go
Bob Ross,"Go into a little bit of brown, and lets make a little tree trunk. Right here. We promised this tree wed make him a nice trunk. Right down in there. There he is"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well, maybe well give him, maybe theres two little trees here, who knows. You put as many or as few as you want in your world. Indication here and there of a trunk, or limb or two on it"
Bob Ross,There we are. There we are. Little bit more paint thinner. Into our color. And you can see the indication here and there of a few little limbs and stuff that grow out through there. And over here
Bob Ross,"Shoomp. There we are. Great big one. There. Well put a few highlights on those branches. And well bout have a finished painting. As I mentioned earlier, this is the last show of the 18th series"
Bob Ross,"And its very, very special that youve allowed me to come back into your home again for another series of painting shows and, and we share this time together"
Bob Ross,"And I thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to be part of your, of your activities, and your family. Its very special to me. And we already have the next series under production"
Bob Ross,"So if youll keep watching us, well keep right on painting. So Ill tell you what. Throw a few things on here, and were gonna call this painting all finished"
Bob Ross,"And until the next series, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend"
