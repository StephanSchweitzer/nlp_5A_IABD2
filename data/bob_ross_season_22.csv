Bob Ross,"- Hello, Im Bob Ross, and Id like to welcome you to the 20 second joy of painting series. First of all, let me thank you for inviting us back for another series of painting shows"
Bob Ross,"And if this is your first time with us, allow me to give you a personal invitation, to drag up your paints and spend a relaxing half hour with us as we put some of natures master pieces on canvas"
Bob Ross,"So Ill tell you what, lets start out today, have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us at home"
Bob Ross,"And while theyre doing that, come on up here and let me know you what Ive got done already. I have a 18 x 24 inch canvas, but you use whatever size is convenient for you"
Bob Ross,"And this is a pre-stretched, double prime canvas. And Ive covered the entire canvas with just a thin, even coat, of liquid white"
Bob Ross,"And the liquid white is on there, only to make the canvas wet it makes it slick. It allows us to actually blend the painting on the canvas, so were not working ourselves to death here on the palette"
Bob Ross,"So Ill tell you what, lets grab an old brush and lets just have some fun today. Well start today with an old two-inch brush. Well go into a small amount of the Prussian blue"
Bob Ross,"This is a very strong color, takes very very little paint. Just pull a little out and then tap the bristles into it"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna reach right here and get a little bit of the midnight in black and just sort of mix them together. So we have black and blue, or blue and black. Whatever your preference"
Bob Ross,"Lets go right up here to the canvas. Now then, in doing landscapes, normally you want the whole thing to be darker at the top, and then lighter toward the horizon"
Bob Ross,"And by starting at the top and making little crisscross strokes, allowing the color to blend with the liquid white thats on the canvas, that will happen automatically"
Bob Ross,"Its very easy, just like so, well just make little xs, little crisscross strokes. Allow that color to blend, there. And If youre working on a dry canvas, this would be very difficult"
Bob Ross,"But since this canvas is wet, and youre continually blending color, this is very simple, very simple. This is truly the lazy mans way of painting. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And I think Ill have some big fluffy clouds in this one today, so Im just gonna leave an area sort of open here, and thats where my clouds will live"
Bob Ross,"Alright, Im gonna come down, oh I dont know, maybe to about like there. Just sort of let it happen, dont worry about it"
Bob Ross,"If youve painted with me before, you know that we dont make mistakes, we just have happy accidents. Because very quickly, you can learn to work with anything that happens here"
Bob Ross,"I think Ill have a little water in this, so while I have that same color on the brush, just Prussian blue and midnight black, just gonna put a little indication of some water here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe Ill put a little more color on my brush, make it a little darker, there we go. Alright. paintbrush strokes Theyre both in the outside in and leave an area open here"
Bob Ross,"If everything works just right, thatll look like a little sheen of light coming across the water. And it will certainly enhance your painting. There, I put a little more of the color"
Bob Ross,"Well go on the other side, do the same thing. But pull from the outside in. See if you start here and you go across, look all the horrible line you get here"
Bob Ross,And then you have to really work to blend that out. So start from the outside and pull toward the center. Or wherever you want your little light sheen to be here. Okay let me wash the old brush
Bob Ross,"Thats the fun part of this whole technique. Course they dont think so around the station here. Because Ive covered everything, as you will see. Put the paint thinner, shake off the excess"
Bob Ross,"paintbrush tapping chuckles And just beat the devil out of it. Okay now with a clean brush, we can just go across here and blend all this together"
Bob Ross,"paintbrush strokes There, but see that light spot still remains in there. Its not very distinct but its strong enough to indicate what were trying to show"
Bob Ross,"And we can blend the sky, and I dont want to overblend it. I like to have little areas that show variations, so its just not a flat, dead sky"
Bob Ross,"But in your painting, you sort of look at it, and you decide how you want it. And you step back and take a look see every once in awhile so you can see it from a distance"
Bob Ross,"paintbrush strokes There we are. Because if you back up and look at your painting, its much easier to see. Sometime when youre standing, this close to it, its sort of difficult to, to see"
Bob Ross,"Lets use a one-inch brush, then Im gonna make a happy little cloud up here in the sky. For that, lets take just titanium white. Ill be right back, dont go away"
Bob Ross,"A little big of the bright red, very small amount though. Put a little sunshine on this cloud. Okay lets go up here. Now then, very gently, and all were doing is just sort of tapping the canvas"
Bob Ross,Just let the corner of the brush touch and begin thinking where your little cloud would live in your little world. And this piece of canvas is your world
Bob Ross,And on here you can do anything that your heart desires. You can create any illusion that you want here
Bob Ross,"You can find peace and tranquility here, or you can make big storms that just, just depends on what your mood is that day"
Bob Ross,"There, painting is sort of a way of capturing the second of time and a mood, putting it on canvas"
Bob Ross,"And maybe a hundred years from now someone will look at your painting and theyll know that you had a fantastic day. And then on this day, you truly did experience the joy of painting. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of let these little things just work around and have fun, let them play. Clouds are very free, they may be one of the freest things in nature"
Bob Ross,"They just sort of float around in the sky and have a good time. There we are. Okay, now well go back to our two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"paintbrush tapping Be sure its good and dry and very carefully, just gonna take the corner of the brush, the top corner, and just go in little tiny circles. Little, tiny circles"
Bob Ross,"I dont wanna touch the top edge up here at all yet. Very gently. This is two hairs and some air. Just whisper light, whisper light"
Bob Ross,"blows air Because you can destroy these little things that youve made in here very easy. Very light, barely touching, very gentle, caress it"
Bob Ross,"There we are, now- paintbrush tapping I just beat the brush to knock off any excess paint. Now very lightly we can fluff this cloud, we can lift it"
Bob Ross,"But this is a very gentle touch, just barely lifting upward. But you can see how that cloud is beginning to fluff up. There, and then very lightly, one hair and some air"
Bob Ross,"Just go across now takes out all the little tap marks, brings everything together and make some of the most fantastic clouds youve ever seen. And its very simple. paintbrush strokes Alright, shoot"
Bob Ross,"We got a nice little cloud there. Now that, maybe today. Tell you what. Lets build a very simple little mountain. Everybody seems to like mountains, so lets, lets make us one"
Bob Ross,"Well take us from black, some Prussian blue. Im gonna get a little van dyke brown too, what the heck. Maybe even alizarin crimson, just good dark color"
Bob Ross,"There, okay, now pull it out as flat as you can get it. Take the knife, cut across, then get a little roll of paint, and it should live right out on the edge of the knife"
Bob Ross,"You can see how its right out on the edge there. Okay, lets go up here. Now then you have to make a major decision. Come right up here. Now you have to decide in your world where your mountain lives"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, it lives right here. And you can make any kind of mountain that you want, its up to you"
Bob Ross,"Up to you, well just, well make something maybe today that maybe sort of resembles the Tetons or mountains in that area. And the Tetons have a, they have a lot of little points on them"
Bob Ross,"Little jagged, ragged things, and thats what well make. But you can make a mountain thats very smooth. Its totally up to you. Once again, painting is a very individual thing"
Bob Ross,Thats the reason we use no patterns and no tracings. Cause then were just painting somebody elses thing
Bob Ross,"I wanna teach you to make a world that belongs only to you and its unique to you and your personality. There, okay"
Bob Ross,"Now well take a two-inch brush, and we wanna grab this paint and pull it, and theres two things. Maybe the most important one, is it removes excess paint so the next layer will stick much easier"
Bob Ross,"But it also creates this nice, misty area at the base of the mountain. And mountains are always more distinct on the top, then they are on the bottom. If you can see the entire mountain"
Bob Ross,"Because theres mist and now we have wonderful pollution, that hang around down here at the bottom. And it breaks up and diffuses light, so thats why you have misty look at the base of the mountains"
Bob Ross,"Alright. paintbrush strokes And by using brushstrokes when you pull this, I hope thatll show up, but you can literally lay out all your highlights and shadows. Can you see whats happening"
Bob Ross,"Without being commited. Its sort of a sneaky little way of seeing what your mountains gonna look like before you paint it. But you can lay out everything, that easy"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets just take a, well just use that same old titanium white, right here. Pull it out, once again, as flat as you can get it. Cut across, and a little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"See, lets do that one more time. Cause thats so important, pulling out flat, cut across, little roll of paint. That easy, lets go up here. Now then, you have to start making some big decisions"
Bob Ross,"chuckles Ive mentioned before in other shows when I was teaching my son Steve to paint, I used to tell him, Just pretend youre a whisper, floating right across the mountain and youre not even"
Bob Ross,"touching it, youre just, youre just floating right across there.  There. See how you can create all kinds of little things"
Bob Ross,"Anything that you want, you just decide where these little things live in your world"
Bob Ross,"And just barely touching it, and you want the paint to break like this, thats what makes all those beautiful little, little things you see in there. And it happens automatically"
Bob Ross,"All you have to do is learn to make the knife barely, barely touch the canvas, gentle. We receive a lot of letters"
Bob Ross,"One of the things that I hear over and over again is people are having trouble doing this. Normally you can equate it to one or two problems. First of all, the paints too thin"
Bob Ross,"We use a very firm, dry paint. Much firmer than traditional oil painting paints. Secondly, the pressure that youre applying, if you apply too much pressure, its gonna look just like your ice to cake"
Bob Ross,"Everyday I get letters from people and they say, theyve watched the show and theyve tried it and its working, and they take the paintings and they show it to friends and relatives and they dont"
Bob Ross,"believe that they painted them. Thats always wonderful to hear. For a little shadow here Im taking little Prussian blue and white, and just mixing it here together"
Bob Ross,"Once again, you can even use a small edge, see and pull out a little roll of paint, or you can use a small knife, whichever is convenient for you"
Bob Ross,"We have two different sized knives, so pick out the one that you like. And you go back in here now, and begin putting in some little shadow areas. I want this to remain quite dark"
Bob Ross,I dont wanna get too much going on back here. These areas are deep in shadows here. There we are. paintbrush tapping But this is where you begin forming all these little things
Bob Ross,"This is where the little mountain goat lives, right up in here. He needs a little place to call home too just like the rest of us. And you have to take care of gods little creatures, there"
Bob Ross,"paintbrush tapping He could be over in here, like that. Wherever, wherever, just sort of let your imagination go"
Bob Ross,"And you can come right along in here and any place you wanna show a little, a little break here. You just put a little shadow and automatically itll happen"
Bob Ross,"Lets take another good clean, dry, two-inch brush. And I wanna create mist at the base of this mountain. So all you need to do is tap, but follow these angles when you tap, dont just chop across"
Bob Ross,"Itll look like, look like somebody took a big razor blade and cut your mountain off. Just tap and then gently lift upward. The same angle that the mountain flows here, same angle"
Bob Ross,"Itll create a beautiful, soft, misty effect, right at the base of your mountain. Okay, shoot, we got a pretty good looking little mountain there too"
Bob Ross,"Alright, lets, lets take the old round brush today. Im gonna use that same basic mountain color"
Bob Ross,"We had Prussian blue and black, little alizarin crimson, paintbrush tapping There, I think we had some van dyke brown. Im gonna reach up here get a little sap green put in there too"
Bob Ross,Lets start making some foliage leaves
Bob Ross,"Back here in front of this mountain, with the old round brush here, we can just take, and just begin tapping, paintbrush tapping Just aside basically, where you want these things to live"
Bob Ross,"There maybe theres a bigger one right there. Big strong one that lives right up here, wherever. You have to make big decisions. There they go, okay, little bit more of the color"
Bob Ross,"paintbrush tapping Alright, maybe, maybe theres a big tree here on the side. But just sort of let your imagination go. Think where, think of if you were a tree where youd like to live"
Bob Ross,"This tree, he lives right here in front of the mountain. He has one of the prettiest views. He looks out over this mountain, and watches, watches everything happen"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes, sometimes you get carried away and these trees keep growing on you. Thats alright. This is your tree. So you make it anyway that you want. Anyway that you want them"
Bob Ross,"In your world you can have anything. Anything, there. Okay, right on down, maybe, somewhere in there we dont care at this point. Lets see mix up a little more color"
Bob Ross,"Black, blues, some brown, little crimson. Little of sap green, ran out of color. There, now then maybe in our world, well have, shoot, lets get crazy"
Bob Ross,gently laughs Maybe theres another tree over here. Thatll sort of block everything in
Bob Ross,"Make sort of a nice composition, that way itll force your eye to go in here and look at this mountain when were done. There, got a little hair there"
Bob Ross,"You get a little hair, just use the corner of your brush and lift it off the canvas, no big deal. These brushes are natural bristles so they do shed. There, till you, till you get those out. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Okay now, maybe, maybe well have some reflections in our water, so all you have to do is just bring some of this color right down. Just let it go. paintbrush tapping Something like that"
Bob Ross,"If we have a tall tree on this side, then were gonna have very long reflections in the water. Alright. paintbrush tapping Okay now, we have to make a big decision. Where does water and land meet"
Bob Ross,"Somewhere right in here in my world. paintbrush strokes There, so just, just begin pulling this down"
Bob Ross,"We dont know exactly whats gonna happen, but somewhere in here well have all this come together. Doesnt really matter at this point. Now very lightly, go across"
Bob Ross,"And thatll create the illusion of instant reflections in your water, that easy. Now have several of each brush going. Let me pick up another little round brush here"
Bob Ross,"I would take a little cad yellow, little yellow ochre, be right back, Im gonna pick up little sap green, but mix these colors on the brush, that way you have a multitude of things happening in that"
Bob Ross,"brush. Look at all the different tones and colors. I dont know if you can ever mix that. If you just sat and tried to mix each one individually. Okay, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"And I just wanna put little indications of some little things, some little highlights on these trees. Just tap, thats all you gotta do. Just tap it"
Bob Ross,"But think about forming shape, dont just hit it random. Think about where the light would play through here, and all these little things would shine and sparkle. There, heres another one"
Bob Ross,"These are just some little background trees. Okay, very loose, right there. And it helps to make up little stories about your scene"
Bob Ross,"Give it, give these characters personalities and then they become individuals to you. Become very special, become your friends"
Bob Ross,"I wanna add a little big of that Indian young, a little bright red here and there"
Bob Ross,"I wanna give this a little, a little indication that maybe Jack Frost has been through here and had a good day and things are beginning to change colors"
Bob Ross,"There, and you can get as wild with autumn scenes as you want, this some of the most beautiful reds and golds in nature. Hmm. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Do you want a little more of the sap green, little cad yellow, maybe, whew lets put a big tree here. paintbrush tapping Think about individual things in there"
Bob Ross,"And once again, this is just gonna end up being a background tree. I think Im gonna put some things in front of it. But you wanna make it look pretty good, because a lot of it is gonna show through"
Bob Ross,"And people would think youve worked for months trying to get in there and put all those little, little individual things in there. And we dont tell them any different, thats, thats our secret"
Bob Ross,"Thats our secret. Cause a lot of people would never believe you could paint this much detail using a big old crazy brush like this. But you can, there. You can do anything"
Bob Ross,As long as you believe you can do it
Bob Ross,"You know it helps to mentally, when you decide youre gonna paint a picture, paint it mentally, several times, and get those strokes sort of worked out in your mind"
Bob Ross,"Know what you want, before you start. Have a general idea of what you want. But do it mentally, just like athletes, they psyche themselves up before big event. You can do that for painting too"
Bob Ross,"Okay, tell you what, maybe over here well put a nice little sparkler. Okay, before we go too far here, I better decide what were gonna do. Im gonna put some nice little tree trunks back in here"
Bob Ross,"So well take some paint thinner, paint thinner. Ill just use some van dyke brown for that, maybe a little dark sand and mixed with it. Give it a little, a little flavor"
Bob Ross,"But this paint should be very thin, almost like ink. This is a script liner brush, it holds a lot of paint, but it needs to be very thin. Lets go up here, maybe, maybe, maybe"
Bob Ross,"Yup, right here lives a big old, strong tree. A little more of the paint thinner, load the brush full again"
Bob Ross,"But let the brush wiggle and jiggle, so its just not a plain old, straight, telephone pole looking tree. I sort of like the trees to have character. There, be individuals"
Bob Ross,"I dont want all my trees to grow up to be just telephone poles. There we go, but maybe in your world, thats what you want. And theres freedom on this canvas, you can do anything here"
Bob Ross,"You can even string wire on your tree if you want to, its okay. There. And over there, this is the tree that lives right along, and he too has a beautiful view of the mountain. Alright"
Bob Ross,"paintbrush swishing in water And we can come back, Ill take a little paint thinner, and little, little white. But at least itll touch a bright red in it"
Bob Ross,"You can come right back in here, and add some highlights to your tree. Your mountain tells you the lights coming from the right side. That easy. You can make it a little tree to stand out there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, back to my brown. Dont want the other side left out, itll get jealous. And nothing worse than a mad tree, Ill tell ya"
Bob Ross,"And maybe theres a little that lives right here, in front of that great, big one"
Bob Ross,"But by doing it this way, painting that tree first and then painting trees in front of it, it creates the illusion of depth and distance in your painting. Its not, its not flat. Its not flat"
Bob Ross,"So many paintings I see are just very flat. This way you build depth. Youll be able to see between things and look back in there and just awe, its fantastic"
Bob Ross,"Ive painted literally, tens of thousands of paintings, and I still get excited every time I see this work. Every time there"
Bob Ross,"Okay just all kinds of little limbs and sticks and twigs and wherever you think they should live. But if that paint doesnt flow for you, chances are you dont have enough paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Just add a little more paint thinner, youll, it will begin sticking on. Go back to my round brush onto a little yellow ochre, little bit of bright red, and just mix them together"
Bob Ross,"Well put some, maybe a little more of the red. Lets sparkle this up. Were gonna have fall colors, lets go crazy"
Bob Ross,"Maybe on this one here, we can see- Oh, thats a nice one, look at there, but right over the top of that other tree. Its alright, we dont care. There, see. Just pretend its not there"
Bob Ross,"Dont pay any attention to it. Cause you want it to look natural. In nature, one tree does not worry about being in front of another tree. It just grows wherever it can get to most light and water"
Bob Ross,"And thats where we want our paintings to look. There, and maybe theres a few, bright little things on this side. Look at there, this whole round brush is just fantastic things"
Bob Ross,"Even if youve never painted before, this son of a gun will just drop them right in there. Okay, maybe its a little land out here. We need something for this to stand though"
Bob Ross,Ill take a little van dyke brown. Lets go right in here. And lets decide where the land lives. And this is just the base color. Well come back and highlight it
Bob Ross,"Ill tell you what, maybe theres a little, a little peninsula that lives right out here. Wherever you want it, just sort of drop it in. On the other side here, just a little. There it goes. There"
Bob Ross,"Now, we can take a little titanium white, little dark sienna, kind of just mix them together but looslely so the colors not over mixed, and just barely, caress the top of that"
Bob Ross,"Just let it, just let it pick up here and there. Dont push hard though with the knife. This is just like laying snow on the mountain"
Bob Ross,"Cause if you push hard, its gonna destory the under color, and we dont want that. And lets take us a fan brush. Im gonna dip it in a little liquid white"
Bob Ross,"Just a thin pain because one of our golden rules, thin pain will stick to a thick paint. Take the same colors and mix them on the brush here. Alright, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Just gonna push upward, with the fan brush. Just pop in a few little grassy areas that live right back in here. Follow the lay of the land here, thats very important"
Bob Ross,"This is where you create that flow of the land. Thats where its created, right here. Just by making these little areas, you can see exactly how this flows, there we go"
Bob Ross,paintbrush strokes Dont kill all your little dark areas. These dark areas at the base of trees and stuff are extremely important. Theyre the shadows deep in there
Bob Ross,"Thats where the little bunny rabbit hides. lightly chuckles And he has to have a place to hide. Take a little liquid white, pull it out very flat, cut across, lets get a little paint on here"
Bob Ross,"Lets just put us in a little water line. This light area separates the two darks, and cleans up the bottom and brings it altogether"
Bob Ross,"Just brings it together- act like youre trying to cut hole, right in the canvas. And this whole canvas is very tough, very tough. Okay, now then. Here we are"
Bob Ross,"paintbrush strokes Yeah, lets get crazy. gently laughs Lets get crazy. We got a minute or so left. And you know, if you painted with me, I like big trees"
Bob Ross,"We have one, see right in front of everything though. Lives right there. Just van dyke brown. And we take out same brown and white we used. Lets just touch, barely touch"
Bob Ross,"GIve it a little, a little pull here. Just a little pull, see. Maybe this whole, tree. Maybe its about dead. Just put a few limbs on it, and let it sort of just hang around out here"
Bob Ross,"A little paint thinner and the liner brush. And well just put a big old limb here and there. Just like so. Few of them still hanging on, still hanging on"
Bob Ross,"Not too many, dont want ruin the illusion that this old tree is just hanging around here and dead. Okay, I think we have pretty nice little painting there. Hope youve enjoyed this one"
Bob Ross,"And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and god bless my friend. music playing"
Bob Ross,"- Hello, welcome back. Im certainly glad you could join us today. Its a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever youre at"
Bob Ross,"So, I tell you what, lets start out today and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, come on up here, let me show you what weve got already"
Bob Ross,Weve got our standard old pre-stretched canvas and I use an 18 x 24 but you can use any size thats convenient for you
Bob Ross,"Weve covered the entire surface with a thin, even coat of liquid white and that makes the canvas wet and slick and its all ready to go"
Bob Ross,"So, I hope you have your oil paints out and youre ready to spend a relaxing half hour"
Bob Ross,Thought today wed just do a fantastic little scene thats very pretty and very easy and well just have a good time together. Lets start out with a little Alizarin crimson. Just a little
Bob Ross,Pull a little out and tap it into the two inch brush. Maybe well have a nice warm area in the sky of this little painting. Lets go right up in here
Bob Ross,"And just using our little crisscross strokes, just make little xs. Let it blend with the liquid white. Those colors will just soften and blend automatically. You dont have to worry about it"
Bob Ross,Use very little color here. We dont want to set the sky on fire. All I want to do is just create a little glow up here. Something about like that. Maybe well do some little mountains today
Bob Ross,"I like mountains and thats the most single requested thing that people write in to say theyd like to see and do. So, well do some. Well take a little of the phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"Didnt even have to clean the brush cause crimson is so weak in comparison to the blue. The blue just eats it up. So we can start right up here, still making our little crisscross strokes"
Bob Ross,"And just lay in a happy little sky. That simple. There, just bring it about down to the crimson and well stop, clean the brush and blend it"
Bob Ross,"Otherwise, once again, this blue is so strong, itll just consume your crimson. Itll go away and leave you. Youll be all alone here with just a blue sky"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, while we have blue on the brush, lets put a little water in here. You know me, I love water"
Bob Ross,"Take a little of the phthalo blue and reach over here and get a touch, just a touch, of the phthalo green. Its very, very, very strong. Whew, be careful with it"
Bob Ross,"And maybe well go in here and lay in an indication of a little water. Just pull from the outside in, as we normally do. I like to have a little glimmer of light coming across the water. There, OK"
Bob Ross,"And a little bit more of the blue, a little more phthalo green. Come from the other side and just let these come together, like that. Alright. Now then, lets wash the old brush"
Bob Ross,"If youve painted with me before you know this is the fun part of this whole technique. This is where we really get crazy. Just odorless thinner, paint thinner. Shake off the excess"
Bob Ross,"rattling and thumping laughs And just beat the devil out of it. Alright, lets go right up here where the blue and the pink come together"
Bob Ross,"Now then, just wanna continue to use the little crisscross strokes and begin blending that together. Something about like that. You cant tell where one color stops and the next color starts"
Bob Ross,"There we are. And down here, we just go all the way across. Thatll bring our water together. But we still have this indication of light zinging right across there. Just sliding across the water"
Bob Ross,"Alright. Tell you what, lets take an old one inch brush. I want to put some happy little clouds up here. Happy little clouds"
Bob Ross,"And well just use a titanium white today, right on the old one inch brush. And maybe we have a little cloud that lives right up here. He just floats right in the sky and has a good time"
Bob Ross,"Now all were doing is just sorta tapping and hitting the canvas so you get those nice, fluffy little edges. Just little fluffy edges. There. But sorta round so its got form and shape to it"
Bob Ross,"There we are. And you can begin creating all kinds of little individual effects. Something like that. We do one layer at a time. Just work on individual layers. OK, thats our first layer"
Bob Ross,"rattle Take a good, clean, dry two inch brush and just barely blend it. We want to leave these nice top edges but blend behind it a little bit. Now, very lightly. Just lift it a little"
Bob Ross,"And it creates a nice little floater up there in the sky. Let me show you something. I get carried away sometimes, I keep seeing things that we can do"
Bob Ross,Lets take a little Alizarin crimson and phthalo blue and mix it together so we have a little lavender-like color. Watch here. A little bit on the fan brush. Lets go right up here
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, right back in here, lets just have a few little clouds that just sort of float around and have a good time. We just call these floaters for lack of a better word"
Bob Ross,"Some of our friends who fly airplanes will probably tell me the correct name for these but I just call em little floaters. They just hand around and have a good time. Very gently, go across"
Bob Ross,"This will give us the indication that some little things are floating way back in the distance. Now then, lets really get crazy. Lets just put another big old cloud that lives right in here"
Bob Ross,"And this one comes right down over the top of the little floaters that we laid in. And just sorta comes right out about like that. In your world, you put clouds wherever you want em"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you want. There, this is probably one of the freest techniques Ive ever been exposed to. It allows you to do anything that you want. Anything"
Bob Ross,"And then once again, back to our two inch brush and well blend that a little. Something about like that. Dont have to blend it a great deal. Just enough to blend the base of it a little"
Bob Ross,"And very lightly. Lift it, fluff it, blend it, bring it together. Look at that, theres such a mass of clouds and theres so much depth in there. Its that easy. There, OK"
Bob Ross,"Fantastic, I think were in business. rattle Just knock the excess paint off that old brush. And were gonna have some mountains today we decided"
Bob Ross,"So, lets take some black, well use a little of the Prussian blue, some Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, whatever. Good dark color, with sort of a blue base to it. Blue or lavender base"
Bob Ross,"Pull it out very flat, cut across, get our little roll of paint. Lets come right up in here, maybe right there. Just make a decision where you think the old mountains would live in your world"
Bob Ross,"Decide where the peaks are all the valleys. Its what makes painting so much fun. You get to control your world. This is pure, raw power here"
Bob Ross,"When I go home all I can do is, the only power I have is over the garbage. Thats mine, it waits for me and I get to take it out. But on this canvas, I can do anything. I can move mountains, trees"
Bob Ross,"Can even move rivers here, and so can you. I spent half my life in the military and I would play soldier all day"
Bob Ross,"Then at night I would come home and this painting was a world that was full of peace and it was calm and there was no bad things here. OK, lets just take a two inch brush and pull that out"
Bob Ross,"And let it just blend at the base. There, see how soft that base becomes. Just like so. Just keep pulling it"
Bob Ross,This is also an excellent way to sort of lay out and shape your mountains because you can see these brush strokes in here and youre not committed. Sort of a way of cheating a little
Bob Ross,"Nah, its not cheating but its a way of making it easier for you. There we are. No such thing as cheating in painting, if it works and makes you happy, then its good. Then its good"
Bob Ross,The only rule in painting is that there are no rules. Its an individual thing. Individual. Everybody sees nature through different eyes and painting is a way of putting your expression on canvas
Bob Ross,"So enjoy it. Lets take some titanium white. Shoot, lets have some good fun today. Pull it out flat, cut across and get our little roll of paint, as usual"
Bob Ross,Now we can go up in here and lets begin laying in some little highlights. Let that knife just bounce and wiggle and jiggle. Just have fun
Bob Ross,"Think where little things would live, where you want little peaks and valleys. You need a little home for the mountain goats. Theres all kinds of little creatures that live up in here"
Bob Ross,"Just have a good time. OK, see. There, just let it flow. No pressure here, absolutely no pressure. In your mind, just think, nothings touching the canvas but that little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"The knife is not even touching. If you let the knife touch then you, as Steve, my son says, you moosh the paint.  That means you flatten it out and squish it"
Bob Ross,Steve and I have been known to make up words sometimes. Thats one that hes made up and uses but people understand what hes saying when he teaches. And he travels all over the country teaching
Bob Ross,"He teaches literally thousands of people the joy of painting. So, if he gets to your area, go see him. Hassle him a little bit. He does a lot of demonstrations and youll find him a joy to be with"
Bob Ross,"OK, a little of the phthalo blue and white, a little roll of paint on the knife and lets just lay in the indication, here and there, of some little shadow areas"
Bob Ross,"We dont want a whole bunch of color, just where you think thered be a happy little shadow. There. Maybe, right here. There he goes. Lets bring this one distinctly through"
Bob Ross,"That will push that first one back. Sneaky, huh. There, there we go. And just a little touch over in here. Now, sometimes its fun to come back after youve done this and lets just break that up"
Bob Ross,Now you can see a shadow through there. And little things like that will make your painting special. But you need to put a shadow back here. Every highlight needs its own shadow
Bob Ross,"If you dont give it its own shadow it just wont play with you. Itll go home, just go away. There we are. Now then, lets get a clean one, there we are"
Bob Ross,"rattle Ive got so many brushes laying around here. Just take an old two inch brush and gently tap, following the angles in the mountain, as usual. Lift upward"
Bob Ross,"Over here, well follow this angle just to create the illusion of mist. Right down here at the base. Very soft and very gentle"
Bob Ross,"But thats a heck of a range of mountains to make in just a minute or two. And you can do it. You really can do it. Just practice a little bit, be sure you have the right paint"
Bob Ross,"Because it has to be firm, it really does. Thats the one thing I hear over and over when people say their having trouble"
Bob Ross,We always nearly trace it back to the fact that theyre paint is thin and you really have to have a very firm paint to be able to paint wet on wet or layers on top of layers
Bob Ross,"There we go, well just use that mountain color and add a little Van Dyke brown, put a little white in it, a little touch of the sap green, not much. A little more of the white in there"
Bob Ross,"There, thats sort of a nice grayish brown color. Quite pleasant. OK, let me wipe the old knife. Lets grab us a fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Well just put a little of that color on the fan brush and in our world, maybe there lives, well there does now, just some happy little trees back in here"
Bob Ross,These little trees would be a super place for my little squirrel. If you painted with me before you know I have all kind of little creature pets
Bob Ross,"Im gonna share with you today my latest little squirrel thats living with me. He is the most precious little thing. You have to force him to eat, see"
Bob Ross,"We call him Peapod, the pocket squirrel cause he would live in your pocket forever. And one of my neighbors, a young man named Dennis, lives down the street from me found him and brought him to me"
Bob Ross,And he lives with me now. I think I have five squirrels right now and two crows
Bob Ross,And this little squirrel will be ready to turn loose here in just a few more weeks and hell go back to nature and hell have a good time
Bob Ross,"And these things usually stay around the house when I turn them loose so I get to enjoy em sometimes for years and years. Isnt he cute. As I say, we call him Peapod, the pocket squirrel"
Bob Ross,"OK, now we have just an indication back here of some little trees living far back here in the distance. Watch here, lets have some fun. Take a little of that same mountain color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right in here, theres just a little stone. Maybe part of the mountain that lives right in here. Just put that dark in, just like you did to make the big mountain. This is a baby mountain"
Bob Ross,If you take care of it and treat it well It will grow up and be a big mountain like its big brother right above it. A little bit of the white
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add the least little touch of Van Dyke brown in the white, I want to dull it down some down here. Just the least little touch. Just let this sort of play. Let that knife just bounce though"
Bob Ross,"We want this to look like rough places. A little bit right in there. Thats what my dog said when he sat down on sandpaper, he said, ruff.  Alright, there. Same thing"
Bob Ross,Just tap a little bit of mist right at the base of that. I dont want much. Maybe well have some big trees that live in the front of that and thatll help push it back. Im gonna dull that same
Bob Ross,"Take a little brown, phthalo blue and white and make a little shadow color. But I want it duller than the one up high"
Bob Ross,"Just put the indication here and there of a little shadow that lives back in there. Have to have a little shadow in there too. Now, lets clean us off a little spot"
Bob Ross,Even with a palette this big I run out of room sometimes. Thats what happens when you paint with big brushes and big knives
Bob Ross,"Lets take some black, some Prussian blue and put some phthalo green in there. Maybe a little brown and crimson and, what the heck, just a little bit of everything. Good, dark color"
Bob Ross,Let me wipe off the old knife. I have several fan brushes going so Ill grab another one. And on this one were going to put this very dark color
Bob Ross,"And lets put some little evergreens that live in our world, they live right there. And this is the easiest way Ive ever seen of making little trees that look like theyre far far away"
Bob Ross,Cause you dont want too much detail. If you get too much detail then you lose that illusion of distance. When things are far away you dont see a lot of detail
Bob Ross,You see changes in color or shape but not a lot of detail. Maybe well take a one inch brush and well just pop in a few bushes that live right here. Same color
Bob Ross,"A few little bushes that live right out here in front of this, like that. You can just see that little stone thats peeking at you from behind those trees and stuff"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna dip my one inch brush into liquid white. Go into a little cad yellow, get a little sap green. Maybe a little darker, here we go"
Bob Ross,"A little yellow ocher and eventually Ill use the Indian yellow here and pretty soon, little touches of red, bright red. Now then, lets pick out our little trees and bushes that live back here"
Bob Ross,"Theres one, just push sort of upward. Just give it a little upward push. This is one of many ways of making beautiful little bushes. Sometimes we use a little round brush"
Bob Ross,"Ooh, theres one thats got more Indian yellow and yellow ocher in it. So, its got a little different flavor"
Bob Ross,"Little touch of the bright red right on the tip will make it look like theres flowers on these trees. Thats sort of nice. OK now, lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Lets grab the very bottom of that and pull straight down. Just straight down. I want a dark color down here. Very dark color. There, OK. Right on down. Tell you what, lets take a fan brush"
Bob Ross,I want to dip it into the liquid white and then go into titanium white and the least little touch of phthalo blue in it. Very little of phthalo blue
Bob Ross,I dipped it in the liquid white to make the paint thinner cause a thin paint will slide right over the top of a very thick paint without mixing
Bob Ross,Or just mixing a little bit depending on the amount of pressure that you put. Maybe theres a waterfall that lives right up in there. And well just push in some happy little things
Bob Ross,And the water plays right along here. See there. Just let it play though and maybe theres another little thing there. Theres all kind of little stones and rocks under there that create little bumps
Bob Ross,"Places the water falls and carries on. Make up little stories and think about this just some floating right down here. Choo. Make those little noises, that really helps. That really helps"
Bob Ross,"That sort of wanders right on out in there somewhere. Something like that. Lets take, oh there it is, I lost my brush. When you get my age the mind sort of slips away sometimes"
Bob Ross,You have to go looking for it. laughs Lets take a little more of the dark color on this brush and I wanna push that little waterfall way back into there
Bob Ross,"So, well put the indication here of some more little trees that live back in the background. And all were doing is just tapping downward. Just tapping downward"
Bob Ross,And dont let these become too symmetrical or just alike. Have different shapes here. Otherwise theyll begin looking like they just came out of a copy machine. Trees are different
Bob Ross,"Theyre not all straight, theyre not all crooked. Theyre like people, theyre individuals. Thats what makes em so fantastic"
Bob Ross,"Can you imagine how boring the world would be if everybody was just alike. Its fun to have different people with different beliefs, different looks. Thats what makes it interesting"
Bob Ross,"And its the same when your doing paintings. Enjoy the differences. Tell you what, while we got the little brush going. Yeah, stand back and take a look"
Bob Ross,"In our world theres gonna be, there is now, a big bush that lives right here. Were just pushing upward with this one inch brush just to make all those little trees and stuff that live in there"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Just drop those in. At the same time Im gonna reverse the brush and tap downward and thatll end up, if all goes well, thatll end up being our little reflections in the water"
Bob Ross,Just like that. Alright. Now we can take a two inch brush and we grab those reflections and pull em straight down. Straight down. Dont let em go at an angle like that. It just wont look right
Bob Ross,"Itll bother your eye when you look at it. Same thing on the other side and go across. And that easy, we have instant reflections. Now, we can go back"
Bob Ross,"Take a little of the black, a little midnight black and go into yellow. That makes a beautiful, beautiful green color. There, pull that brush in one direction loading it full of color"
Bob Ross,"Look at all the paint. Good, lets go up here. Now then, lets go back in here and begin picking out individual bushes and trees that hide back here"
Bob Ross,"Reload the brush continually and just change the flavor a little by adding a little yellow ocher, a little more green or whatever it takes. Just so theres a little variation in color. There"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its fun to put a little red on the tip. As I mentioned earlier, make those bushes look like they have little red flowers hanging out there"
Bob Ross,On the other side we can do the same thing while we have this old brush going. Add the least little touch of paint thinner to the paint. Make it a little thinner
Bob Ross,"Thin paint, once again, will stick to thicker paint. But if the thickest paint is on the brush when you do this itll just pull the paint off the canvas onto your brush"
Bob Ross,If you do this and you begin getting a lot of color off the canvas check to be sure the paint on your brush is thinner than the paint on the canvas. Thats really all it amounts to
Bob Ross,"Its just a difference in thickness of paint. There we go. And right there lives another one. Work in layers, always completing the most distant one first then coming forward, forward, forward"
Bob Ross,chuckles Lets take some Van Dyke brown get crazy. Maybe in our world theres a nice little stone lives right in here. This is gonna be the bank
Bob Ross,Theres gotta be a place to hold all this nice greenery up so it doesnt fall over in the water and make a big splash. Might be a little beaver lives here it would scare him to death
Bob Ross,We dont want to do that. Hope you enjoy seeing my little creatures. I am so crazy about some of these little rascals. I have one that we call Squirrelly Girly Brown and shes a mess
Bob Ross,"Boy, that little squirrels somethin else. Shes just about ready to turn loose, shes full-grown now. Shes been with me for eight or nine months. She is something else"
Bob Ross,And she hides nuts all over my house. The other day I went fishing with a friend and I went to put on my fishing shoes and there was a pecan in the toe
Bob Ross,You ever put your shoe on and somebodys put something in the end of it. Certainly gets your attention
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little white, little bit of the dark sienna and lets go up here and just touch and bounce"
Bob Ross,And were just going to put the indication of some nice little things that are happening right along in here. But leave a dark area underneath and Ill show you why in a minute
Bob Ross,Lets do the other side while we got this going. Leave a dark area underneath cause we want this to be deep. Have height to it
Bob Ross,"OK, wipe the knife and well grab just the base of that and pull a little tiny bit of that color down using the small edge of the knife"
Bob Ross,Or sometimes I just use a small knife depending on how you feel at that moment. But itll create the illusion that this is thick. Its not just coming out there
Bob Ross,"And you sorta change the angles now and then. Something like so. Take a little touch of the liquid white, lay it out here and well get a fan brush. Put a little of that on it"
Bob Ross,Thats just liquid white on the fan brush. Just go in here and put the indication of just some little things right in here. Not much. A little bit on the other side. There we are
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, we got just a second left here. Put in a happy little tree. This drives my director crazy when we do this but well do it anyway. Shes mean, shell be out here to get me in a second"
Bob Ross,"Just drop in a happy little tree. Give him a little friend right there. Come back with a little of that same dark color we used and we just pop in, maybe this is a big evergreen"
Bob Ross,Pop in the indication of a few little limbs and stuff that hang right out like that. And this little tree needs some too. There we go. Very simple way of making some very effective little trees
Bob Ross,"Pick up a little yellow, itll turn green and we can highlight that a little. And the old clock on the wall tells me that its about time to leave you for today. I really hope youve enjoyed this one"
Bob Ross,"Its a lot of fun. Itll teach you how to use all the equipment. And I think youll be amazed at what you can do. And from all of us here, happy painting and God bless my friend. light jazzy music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Im certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today wed do one of my favorite kind of paintings where we use the black gesso"
Bob Ross,"So, Ill tell you what, lets start out and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint with us at home. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got prepared today"
Bob Ross,"So, I say this black gesso is one of my favorite ways to paint. And today, Ive taken black gesso, as you can plainly see, and just painted the bottom with a little foam brush"
Bob Ross,And Ive used the little brush and just made some indications here that look like little distant trees
Bob Ross,"This is one of the neatest, sneakiest ways of making little distant trees that look like theyre far away. And itll save you a lot of time in your painting. So, I think youll enjoy this one"
Bob Ross,"So, lets going to started. Ill start out today with the old two inch brush and little bit of the, well use a little Phthalo Blue today"
Bob Ross,"What the heck, such a fantastic day, lets use some bright colors that just, they make you happy"
Bob Ross,"Just tap the bristles into the color to just make sure that you have a nice even distribution of color all the way through the brush. Okay, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Now, Ive got the top covered with Liquid White as usual"
Bob Ross,"The bottom of this canvas Ive covered totally and completely with a thin even coat of Liquid Clear on top of that, then weve just put a little Sap Green"
Bob Ross,"And put a little Van Dyke Brown in to dull it. Then you can see theyve sort of blended together. Already you have a misty effect. Now, watch here. Well take a little of the Phthalo Blue"
Bob Ross,Just make little criss-cross strokes. Start at the top as usual. And we work all the way across. Just allowing that color to blend. And its blending with the Liquid White thats on the top here
Bob Ross,And well just bring it right on down. And just let all of these little colors just come together. That easy. That easy. Isnt that neat
Bob Ross,"Already though, it gives the impression that theres trees far back in the distance and you can see beautiful little misty areas in there"
Bob Ross,"This black gesso is one of the neatest things that weve ever developed. There, okay. And then, very lightly, we can just go across to take out the brush strokes and blend everything together"
Bob Ross,"And that easy, we have a fantastic little sky. And our distant trees already. And it only takes a matter of a minute or two to do this. Try this, youll really like it. Now then"
Bob Ross,"Lets begin building something in the foreground. Lets take, ponderous vocalization well make some big evergreens, so well take some black, I wanna use Prussian Blue today"
Bob Ross,"I like that Prussian Blue. And Phthalo Green. And maybe a little Alizarin Crimson, what the heck. Long as theyre good dark colors. And I want a blue-greenish base to it"
Bob Ross,"So anything that comes out looking that way will work fine. Okay, let me wipe off the old knife here. Well just want to wipe the knife on a paper towel. And Ill find a little fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Number six fan brush. And we load it full of color. A lot of paint in the bristles, both sides. There, okay, lets go up here to the canvas. Now then, we have to make some big decisions"
Bob Ross,"Where does evergreens live. So well just pick a point here and start. All you do is touch, make us a little center line. And just let it run right down like that"
Bob Ross,"Use the corner of the brush, as you work down the tree apply more and more pressure. So that tree gets bigger, stronger, fuller as it works downward. Look at there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then, maybe well give him a little friend. Were gonna cover up a lot of these little background trees that were make with the black gesso. But were gonna leave some of em showing through"
Bob Ross,And you will not believe the distance that you can create in a painting. Just by doing little tricks like that. There we are. I like to paint these little evergreens. Theyre a lot of fun
Bob Ross,And this will give you a lot of practice. Maybe well do them all the way across the canvas here. This would be a nice place for my little squirrel to live
Bob Ross,"In the last show, we showed you a little squirrel that we called Pea Pod the Pocket Squirrel. And weve had so many people write and call about him, I wanna show him again"
Bob Ross,"Maybe we can introduce you to him again. In case you missed him last time. We called him a pocket squirrel, because he would absolutely, I think, live in my pocket. Continually"
Bob Ross,"There he is, isnt he the sweetest little thing. Hes just a little baby gray squirrel. And he climbs down in my pocket at home and rides around in there all day"
Bob Ross,And then sometimes he even falls asleep in the old pocket. And hell stay there for hours and hours if I allow him to. There. Im just makin some little evergreens while you watch it
Bob Ross,"See, now, when he climbs down in the pocket, thats what he looks like when hes asleep. I wanted you to see what he looks like up close. Isnt he somethin"
Bob Ross,"Of course, hes got huge foots for his size. makes amused vocalization Well, hes been with me now for about a month. About month. And hell be ready to go in just a few more weeks"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a few more months. Sometimes I keep em a little longer than actually I have to, to make sure they get the best possible start in life. And then we turn em loose and off they go"
Bob Ross,"And pretty soon they have their own little squirrels. And a little condo in Miami and car payments and BMW, you know, all the regular problems that the rest of us have"
Bob Ross,"There, Im just still making little evergreen trees using the corner of the old fan brush. And in your world, you put as many or as few as you want. Its up to you, totally and completely up to you"
Bob Ross,Lets put a little baby one right in between there. There. Just a little guy. Thats for my little squirrel. And then we need a couple of big strong ones for the big squirrels. Alright
Bob Ross,"So I say, just put as many or as few as you want. And they all shouldnt be perfect. Trees are like people. Some of em have flaws, just like I do. There we are"
Bob Ross,"So, when youre painting trees, if one of em doesnt come out just perfect, thats a nice tree, dont always worry about em being just perfect. Cause it makes your painting look more realistic"
Bob Ross,"Well, lets see, Ill show you, watch here. Let me finish this one real quick. Well just drop in somethin. Maybe, well, lets go right here, doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,Maybe this tree had a bad year and nothin grew right there. And we leave a little place naked. He hasnt got no clothes on right there. Then maybe again here
Bob Ross,"And if youre out selling paintings, and of course none of us are interested in those happy bucks, but if youre out selling your paintings, this is whatll make your paintings sell over your"
Bob Ross,competitors sometimes. Just the fact that you put little details in here that add to the realism. Alright. We painted a whole forest here in just a minute or two. Okay
Bob Ross,"But this is one of the nicest, neatest ways of making the indication of depth in your forest. Because of those trees that were made with the black gesso back here"
Bob Ross,"And the paints transparent enough that they still show through. A lot of times, evergreens like to grow in clumps. So well just put us a clump or two here and there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, tell you what, lets take, well have some trunks in our little evergreens for that. Im gonna take a little Titanium White. A little bit of the Dark Sienna"
Bob Ross,"Well just mix them about like so, so theyre marbled. Let me wipe the knife off. And then you can see it better. Now we cut through that. Just cut through"
Bob Ross,We get a very small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife. Then we can go up here. And we just begin deciding where our little trunks are. And were not gonna see all of the trunk
Bob Ross,"Just here and there, youre gonna see little pieces. Cause theres trees in front of trees, theres limbs. Theres all kind of things in here. There. Okay, wherever you think they should be"
Bob Ross,"Some of em maybe well see all the way down here to the bottom. A little more paint. Now this one here, we can see quite a bit of trunk right in there, in there, in there. Give him a little top knot"
Bob Ross,"Go on down like that. There. But that quick, you can put the indication of a lot of little trees trunks in there. And with whats on your knife, you could just pull through like that"
Bob Ross,"And itll make it look like theres a lot of trees where youve only painted a few. Alrighty. There. Okay, now then. Lets take, oh, well just use that same old fan brush"
Bob Ross,"It has some color on it that has blue in it. So, if we go into yellow, naturally, were gonna have a beautiful green color"
Bob Ross,"And well reach up here, be right back, and get a little black, I wanna dull it down some. Oh, thats better, I want a very dark green. Okay, now then, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Lets begin putting in some nice little highlights on our evergreen trees. Just where you think the light would strike. You have to make a determination at this point, where your lights coming from"
Bob Ross,"Right side, left side, straight on, above. Wherever. Okay, and Im right handed, so I normally have the light coming from the right side"
Bob Ross,"And you will find, if youre right handed, that normally is the easiest way. Now see, Im gonna leave that one without any highlights"
Bob Ross,"In my mind, hes sort of back in the background and maybe these large trees have swiped the light. Theyve got it all and he has none. Just to break it up a little. Just a little one there"
Bob Ross,"There, we dont want this little guy there left out. Little bit on here"
Bob Ross,"Now, when youre doing this, sometimes it starts working so good, it feels good and ya just take off and ya cover the whole tree with highlights"
Bob Ross,"Be very careful that we dont lose all that beautiful dark. That dark color in these may be more important than the light. Treasure it, its your good friend. Take care of it. There we go"
Bob Ross,"I guess we better decide what were gonna put on the bottom of this, maybe. Maybe well do a little. Maybe a little river today that sort of flows around. I dont know, well see"
Bob Ross,"Thats really the beauty of this type of painting. You dont have to make all the decisions immediately. The only thing that you need to know, basically, is the time of day and the time of year"
Bob Ross,"And off you go. And the only thing you need from there is a little imagination, some practice, and just sort of a dream. And off you can go to any place that you wanna be. Anywhere that you wanna be"
Bob Ross,"There. Okay, maybe a little right in there. I dont know, wherever you want it. Somethin like that"
Bob Ross,"And that gives us a whole group of trees, but look at the amount of distance that we have in these trees from just doing this"
Bob Ross,"Because of the black gesso, you have all these little things in the background. And you can take your time and make these much more distinct, and more like trees is you wanted to"
Bob Ross,"Im sorta lazy and was in a hurry and I just sorta threw em on with the foam brush. Okay, lets go into, well just keep usin that same old dirty two inch brush that we were using"
Bob Ross,"And well tap in a a little color here. Were gonna use some Yellow Ochre, Cad Yellow. Indian Yellow, here and there, a little bit of the Bright Red in there"
Bob Ross,"That Bright Red, believe it or not, when put with green makes brown. And its a duller. You would think it would turn everything red, but it actually dulls the color"
Bob Ross,"Now, maybe in our world theres some nice little grassy areas that flow down here. If were gonna have a little river, we need some little grassy areas on the bank"
Bob Ross,"I always like to sit on the bank and watch the river go by. There. So, well do that. But all you have to do is just tap. Just tap. And the more you tap, the darker this will get"
Bob Ross,Because its picking up that Sap Green and Van Dyke Brown mixture thats underneath. So that will happen automatically. Automatically. Just make all these little grassy areas here. Wherever
Bob Ross,"There we go. And if you hear the brush tapping, its just loading a little more color into it. Okay, but think about angles here. Think about how you want the land to flow in your world"
Bob Ross,"Its very important. And well go back with a little touch of highlight color. And once in awhile here, Im gonna add the least little touch of the Liquid White to my brush"
Bob Ross,"I wanna do two things, I wanna thin the paint and brighten it. So itll stand out as a highlight on top of these little grassy areas. There. Now we can begin bringing it together"
Bob Ross,"Once again, the more you tap this, the softer it becomes. Until it can absolutely be made to look like velvet. That smooth. There. Okay, now then"
Bob Ross,"While weve got this old brush, going to, maybe well just use the corner of it. Maybe theres a happy little bush or two that lives right here below the trees. See there. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Maybe hes got a friend named Harry that lives right there. Okay, a little change of color. Maybe well add the least little touch of Bright Red. excited vocalization Look at that"
Bob Ross,This guys the envy of the neighborhood here. He has got one beautiful coat on. Well give him a little friend that lives right there
Bob Ross,"See, you can create the illusion of layers of little trees and bushes. Just little things. This is where all the little creatures live. They hide back in there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, I dont know, one more little one right in here. There. Very soft, very quiet little places. Then we take the liner brush and take a little bit of, oh, well use a little bit of brown"
Bob Ross,"And white. Maybe here and there. Thats jusr indication of a little old tree or stick that lives in there. That easy. Just to drop it in. Now then, time to make some big decisions"
Bob Ross,"Lets go right into Titanium White here. Just load a little on a clean two inch brush. Just pure Titanium White. Now, this is fun to do if youre demonstrating for friends"
Bob Ross,Because they might not know that youve put color under here
Bob Ross,"And all theyll see is you load white paint and begin pulling straight down, and all of a sudden, its gonna mix with the colors underneath. And things will begin happening"
Bob Ross,"As I say, this is a marvelous way of shocking friends or relatives if youre doing a little demonstration for em. Cause itll just jump right out at ya. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And we have instant water underneath there. Now then, lets take a little touch, oh, well use some Van Dyke Brown and Dark Sienna mixed together. Whatever. Cut off a little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets think about, maybe therea little bank right here. Just a little bank. There we are. Okay, here it goes. Do you like seein the little squirrel. chuckles He is some kinda character"
Bob Ross,"As I say, we call him Pea Pod the Pocket Squirrel. Cause that little rascal absolutely loves pockets. I have a ragged robe that I wear around when Im at home. And he climbs in there"
Bob Ross,"And he just rides around. And when I take a shower, I just hang the robe up or somethin. He stays in there while Im showering. And when I come out, hes waitin on me. Ready to go for another ride"
Bob Ross,"Take a little brown and white. Put a little touch of color, just a little highlight right along the top of some of those. There. Somethin like that. Now then, lets grab another fan brush"
Bob Ross,I have several going here. Take a little Liquid White. Go right into some Titanium White. Liquid Whites in there only to make it a little thinner. Lets go up in here
Bob Ross,"And just begin barely grazing the canvas right below that brown. Okay, and then just make it look like theres a little movement in this water. A little shimmer. Little things happening. There"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Just some very nice little spots that happen in there. Now then, lets find, lets use a little filbert brush. Ill show you a little trick. Take some Liquid White"
Bob Ross,"If youve painted with me before, youve seen this one. Let me take a little Dark Sienna, a little Van Dyke Brown. Im gonna mix that with the Liquid White. So that we have a very thin paint"
Bob Ross,"Very thin. Just a little thicker than Liquid White. And well take the brush through Van Dyke Brown, a little Dark Sienna, just mix em together. A lot of color, both sides. Then we go up here"
Bob Ross,"Come right back down here. And only one side, were gonna go through this thin paint. So, we have thin on top. And dark on the bottom. Light, dark, thin, thick"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then, we wanna make some little stones. Take the brush, go in here. And just give it a little, like that. Isnt that neat. Watch all the little stones. How many you want. 10, 20, 100"
Bob Ross,"Its up to you. Up to you, you can have as many or as few as you want in your world. But just like so, and it makes the highlight and shadow in one stroke"
Bob Ross,And then we come back with our little fan brush. And we clean up the bottem of em. Put a little ripple around his foots. And were in business
Bob Ross,"But thats one of the neatest, nicest ways Ive ever seen of making little stones. Okay, lets have some fun, time to get crazy"
Bob Ross,"Well use our one inch brush, and maybe in our world theres gonna live, yep, right here. A nice bush lives here. Its a beautiful place for a bush to live. Right in there"
Bob Ross,"And you just use this dark to put it some background color. This could just about be done with anything. You could put this on with your shoe, it doesnt matter. Really doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"All youre looking for is some basic shapes here. Just very basic little shapes here. Like that. Okay, and then, I have several little one inch brushes goin"
Bob Ross,"Lets take this one, and Ill dip it into a little touch of the Liquid White. Once again, just to thin the color. Well go into yellow, yellow, yellow, Sap Green"
Bob Ross,"Sap Green, and there, all kinds of, little Yellow Ochre, little Indian Yellow. Just back and forth. But that way you get a multitude of colors happening in the brush. Okay, lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Now we have to make big decisions. In our world, theres a bush that lives right here. Just barely pushing upward. Just enough to bend the bristles. A little bit"
Bob Ross,"And begin thinking about shape and form and what makes this little bush an individual. There we go. If and you mind, you turn each bush into an individual. Then youll work one bush at a time"
Bob Ross,"Think about that little rascal. Give him a name if necessary, shoot. Some of your friends might look at you like youre a little strange, but if youre a painter thats expected, its okay"
Bob Ross,"Add a little of the Bright Red to that Yellow Ochre. Whew, well make us a fireball. Lives right there. makes satisfied vocalization Okay, there we go"
Bob Ross,"Im just varying back and forth between those colors. There we are. But work in layers, always work in layers. Then that way you can drop another layer right in. And it separates, it looks different"
Bob Ross,And it gives dimension and depth to your painting. Its not just old flat painting. There. This is one of the things when were teaching instructors
Bob Ross,We work a great deal with teaching you how to make these little individual things. Cause its easy just to hit em at random
Bob Ross,"But youre painting will look special if you put these little efforts into it, little extras. Lets go back to our Van Dyke Brown, a little Dark Sienna. And lets just put us a little land in here"
Bob Ross,"That wont show too much yet. It will, were gonna put some highlights on it. All were doing, once again, is putting in a little base color"
Bob Ross,"And, tell you what, go back to that brush that had a little white on it. Lets put us a little reflection right underneath here. Grab it, pull it straight down again. Straight down"
Bob Ross,"All the way up to here. imitates laser beam Just straight down. Go gently across. Just enough to give it a watery feel. There. See there. Okay, great. Okay, now back to my little fan brush"
Bob Ross,And well go right here. This is just white with a little Liquid White in it. Titanium and Liquid. Just mix em together. And that thin paint will then slide right over top of your thicker paint
Bob Ross,"Without, as my son says, without mushing together. There. Okay, Im gonna back to our little filbert. Lets put some more little stones in there. I like those little stones in the water"
Bob Ross,"And theyre so easy to make this way. Maybe in our world, there we go, theres a happy little stone. Another one right in there. Theres one. Some right up here on the bank"
Bob Ross,And you put as many as you want in your world. This reminds me of some of the scenery that I used to enjoy in Alaska. I lived there for over a dozen years
Bob Ross,And its one of the most gorgeous places on the face of the Earth. I like to tell people God was havin a good day when he made Alaska. Everything went right for him
Bob Ross,"Now then, a little touch of that brown and white. We can go back in here. And put the indication of a little highlight. Right along in here. There, barely touching the canvas"
Bob Ross,"If youve painted mountains, you know this is just barely grazing. Barely, barely grazing. Take our little fan brush that has a little green and yellow in it"
Bob Ross,"Pop in a few little things that work their way right down the side here. It sort of cleans up everything, gets rid of that straight line across there. Just makes it a little more pleasing"
Bob Ross,"Take the knife. And in here and scrape in a few little sticks and twigs. Now, since that was black, these sticks will come out looking dark"
Bob Ross,Sometimes its nice to take a little touch of white color and put in a few little white ones here and there that show up. You find these in the woods all the time
Bob Ross,"It adds interest to your painting when you do that. Okay, lets get crazy. chuckles You know me, I like to do these big tree things. Lets take the browns, both browns, put em on a fan brush"
Bob Ross,"And well come right over here. And Im gonna, once again, take one side through that light color. Maybe well put our light side over here"
Bob Ross,"We dont, I dont think it really matters too much in this particular painting. By double loading that brush, well make both sides of the tree trunk at one time. There we are"
Bob Ross,"See, the light and the dark side hit all at once. Tell you what, that was fun, lets do another one. Maybe in our world, lets get crazy. Maybe theres a great big one here that sort of fell over"
Bob Ross,"Right through that pretty bush. Thats okay, we know hes there. And we know how to make him if we need him again. Lets make this a big tree. Big old tree. There. A little light comin down the side"
Bob Ross,"But just tap with the fan brush. Youll be amazed at what beautiful tree trunks you can make just by tapping with the old fan brush. Thats all that you have to do. Now then, back to my liner brush"
Bob Ross,"Paint thinner. And well go right into a little of that brown color. Well put the indication here and there of some little limbs. And then just like so, just a few here and there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back here in the background. Use a fan brush, some of that dark color. Maybe theres a few little leaves hangin on this tree. Just a few. There. A little highlight. Come right in here"
Bob Ross,"Put the indication of a few little sparklers on this tree. And this last old tree here, maybe its dead. For it, well just put the indication of a few old limbs that are hanging around here. There"
Bob Ross,"But isnt that a fantastic way of making a very effective little scene. Just using the black gesso. It works so well, and you can do it. Give it a try. I think youll absolutely fall in love with it"
Bob Ross,"And with that, I think we have a finished painting. Hope youve enjoyed this one. And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. bright laid back music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Its a fantastic day here and I hope youre also having a fantastic day"
Bob Ross,"So, I tell you what, lets start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, as usual, let me show you what Ive got done up here"
Bob Ross,"I have my standard old 18 by 24 inch pre-stretched canvas, and today Ive taken and cut a little oval out of some adhesive back paper, or contact paper, whatever you call it, and just stuck it on here"
Bob Ross,And weve covered the center with a little bit of the liquid white and its all wet and ready to go
Bob Ross,"Thought today wed do one of those little ovals, thats become one of the most popular things weve ever introduced"
Bob Ross,"So, lets start out with the old two-inch brush, little bit of the phthalo blue, beautiful blue color. And well tap a little into the bristles, and lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Well start up here at the top today just making little criss-cross strokes, little Xs, right over, and thats continually blending with the liquid white"
Bob Ross,"So automatically you get this beautiful variation of color in the beautiful blending. Here we are. There, and a little bit more. Well come right over here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well have a happy little cloud in the sky, so Ill just leave a little area open here. There. Come right on down to about there. it doesnt matter. Doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Anything we dont like we just paint over, keep right on going. Okay, come right across. That just takes out the brush marks and just helps blend everything together. Something like so"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets do the fun part. Lets wash the old brush. And if youve painted with me before, you know this is the part thats most exciting"
Bob Ross,"brush beats against easel laughs Especially to the camera crew. Alright, Ill tell you what, today, lets just use a little one inch brush and make a happy little cloud"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little titanium white. Just pull the old brush through the white here, just to load a little color on it. And lets go up here to the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Now, then, lets figure out where our little fluffy cloud will live in our world. And well start out and sorta let it bounce around and play here. Wherever. Wherever you want it"
Bob Ross,"Little more paint on the brush. But keep the brush moving. If it stays in one place and you go around and around, itll look like a big cotton ball up here in the sky, and were not after that today"
Bob Ross,"There. And maybe an old cloud lives right down here, and comes right on, I dont know, maybe it just goes right on over here somewhere. In your world, you put it wherever you want it. Alright"
Bob Ross,"bangs brush Now back to our two-inch brush, and very gently, just using the top corner, Im gonna blend the base of this cloud out a little. The top, Im not gonna touch at all yet"
Bob Ross,"Just blend it a little, making tiny little circles. Once again, using only the top corner of the brush. bangs brush And I beat the brush a little just to remove any excess paint that weve picked up"
Bob Ross,"Its easier than going through the whole cleaning procedure. In layman terms, thats called laziness. chuckles There we are. Alright. And very gently, well just go across it"
Bob Ross,"And maybe today, maybe theres a couple little layers in our clouds. Maybe we have another little cloud that lives right here, right below that one"
Bob Ross,"Little happy cloud that just sort of floats around in the sky. There he comes. There he comes. Alright. See how easy it is to make these big, fluffy clouds. There. And same thing, once again"
Bob Ross,"Two-inch brush, using just the top corner. And the reason we use the top corner, watch. If you use the bottom corner, you really cant tell where the brush is hitting"
Bob Ross,"Use the top corner, and you can see exactly what youre doing. Okay. And you have a lot more control on the brush that way. Once again, fluff it up a little. Like so. And very gently, just blend it"
Bob Ross,"There. Just enough to take out the little brush strokes. But do em in layers. Do the one thats farthest away first, and then do the second one. bangs brush Alright. Now then"
Bob Ross,"Lets have some little, like little rolling hills that live back in here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take, oh well use a little Prussian blue, a little Alizarin crimson, proportionately, much, much more blue than crimson. And, put a little white out here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe just a touch more of the blue. Ooh, thats nice. Thats nice"
Bob Ross,"So, I have the same color, but two different values here, by putting the white in it, this one, as you can see, is much lighter than this one. Alright, so lets take the lightest one first"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here. Come right up in here, and lets take, and lets just put us a very basic little shape. Something like so. Dont let these get too pointy"
Bob Ross,"This is a little, just a soft little hill. There. Just really push it into the fabric, and then scrape off all the excess. The value, or the color, will remain in the fabric"
Bob Ross,"Then well take our brush, and grab, and firmly pull the paint. Firmly pull it, just like so. There. We want it to get lighter toward the base. Okay, pull it right through there"
Bob Ross,"Think Ill have some trees over here, so Im not too worried about this side. I dont know, if we leave it blank, then for sure well have to put something over there. Alright"
Bob Ross,But thats really all you need. It gives the indication of a nice little rolling hill thats far away
Bob Ross,"And if you wanna make that illusion of depth and distance even greater, we go into that same color that we mixed, thats darker, and well once again pick up a little roll of paint on the knife"
Bob Ross,"Lets go back up in here. Come right back in here. Now then, lets drop right down like that, and lets just put another little hill in here"
Bob Ross,"It helps create that illusion of depth in your painting when you do that. Maybe it turns and goes up right there. I dont know. You decide. In your world, you make all these big decisions"
Bob Ross,"But once again, were firmly, firmly pushing that color right into the canvas. And then well take our two-inch brush, grab it, and just move the color"
Bob Ross,Allow it to actually just blend in the liquid white thats on the canvas. And you always want the base of the hill or mountain lighter than the top
Bob Ross,"And as you can see, look at the little light area in between these two. Thats a separator. Thats your good friend. Take care of it. Treasure it. There we are"
Bob Ross,"And sometimes Ill just dip the brush into a little color, sometimes its fun just to put a little dark area in there, and itll look like theres a whole other plane in there"
Bob Ross,"You can just play all kind of tricks, or you can take and lift gently upward a little bit, and itll look like you can make out the indication of little trees that live way back in the woods"
Bob Ross,"Way back on that hill. See there. I hope you can see those. Theyre quite small, but theyre there. Now then. Tell you what"
Bob Ross,"Lets take, well use that same lavender color, Im gonna add a little black to it. A little black, a little brown, little touch, maybe, of the crimson and sap green. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Lets go right up in here. Right under this, and we have to decide where well have some land areas. Maybe right in here. Well just put a nice little hill. And this is just the base color"
Bob Ross,"This is just, just so our light, our highlights will show when we put em on top of this. You could really put this on with a paint roller. laughs Doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Doesnt matter, but its a good place to practice with a brush. Cause so much of painting is a feel"
Bob Ross,"You, very quickly, you can feel just by touching the canvas, whether your paints too thick, too thin, you got too much on the brush. and it comes with just a little practice. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Ill just use the same old brush"
Bob Ross,"Im lazy today, I dont wanna wash em all, so well use the same old brush and go right into a little bit of the cad yellow, a little yellow ocher, maybe a little bit of sap green, There we are"
Bob Ross,"There. Just gently tap. See. You can see that little ridge of paint. Theres an identical one on the end of the brush, and thats what were after. Lets go up here. Now"
Bob Ross,"Just barely touch and tap downward. And this is one of the easiest, nicest ways of creating the effect of little fields or little grassy areas. Way back here in the distance. There"
Bob Ross,Just let the sun play through there. There we are. Okay
Bob Ross,"And sometimes, its fun just to take, and Ill just grab another brush here, I got a, it doesnt matter what you use, Ill pick up a one-inch, it happens to be handy. Doesnt matter, as I say"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little tree that lives right here. Just a little bushy guy. There. We just put in a little dark color. And, lets give him a little friend. You know me"
Bob Ross,"I think everything needs a friend, even an old tree. Well take a little touch, a little bright red, a little yellow ochre, Im even into a little Indian yellow there. Just a little sparkly"
Bob Ross,"Get that little bit of paint right there. And lets go right up in here, and lets just, ooh, nice. Lets just put some little highlights on that little rascal right there"
Bob Ross,"And this little one here, he needs a few little things too. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now back to our color we were using, well come right in here, and just put a little grass down at the base of those two little trees. But see, that creates a whole other plane in your painting"
Bob Ross,"And these different planes are what give depth. Okay. Now, maybe, lets put a little more color right in here. We need that dark so light will show. There. Tell you what, watch here, watch here"
Bob Ross,"chuckles I get carried away. Maybe right here, maybe theres a happy little pond thats way back here. Pull straight down"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna get just the least little touch of titanium white and just sparkle it. Gotta make those little sounds, though, just pull it straight down, and then very gently, go across"
Bob Ross,"Very gently, just enough to wiggle it a little bit. Ill tell you, lets do it with a fan brush today"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little Van Dyke brown, a little dark sienna on the fan brush, and you can do it with knife, or you can do it with a fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Lets just put in the indication of a little bank, way back in the distance back here. This is just brown. Straight old brown"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a few little dark things that grow right along the edge of the water. Just lift upward, and it makes it look like little bushes, maybe little cattails that are dark in there, whatever"
Bob Ross,"Just make up little stories and drop em in. Little of the liquid white on the knife, and well come back in here and put a little touch of a waterline right along there"
Bob Ross,"Just act like youre trying to cut a whole in the canvas. There. Now then, well go back to our one-inch brush we were using, had black, Prussian blue, crimson, a little sap green. Same old colors"
Bob Ross,"Just should be very, very dark, though. Okay, now then. Maybe, just go, Im touching and sorta pulling downward. Just want a little touch of that lake left back here. Well put in some dark"
Bob Ross,"Alright, right there. chuckles Just sort of look at this and make a decision where you think it should be. Now. Brush is too slow, let me get a big one here"
Bob Ross,"You get lazy after a while, and you like these big brushes. Lets just fill this all in here with some of our nice, dark color. Once again, this dark is here only to make the light show"
Bob Ross,"Because without it, you just, you dont have any light. If you put light against light, you have nothing. If you put dark against dark, you have nothing"
Bob Ross,"So youre always playing games, light against dark, dark against light. Thats what makes it work. Just illusions. We only have a two-dimensional surface here, so everything is just illusions"
Bob Ross,"While were working on that illusion, lets get crazy here, what the heck. Take a look-see, decide, we said there was gonna be a big tree right here. Well, lets just have us a big tree"
Bob Ross,"Well just use the corner of the old two-inch brush. Same basic colors. Same colors. Let that old tree live right out there. Tell you what, while we got that going, lets have one over here too"
Bob Ross,"chuckles Youll get carried away with these, theyre fun. But you can make very detailed little trees and bushes with a two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"It doesnt have to be a little Tiny Tim brush to make small things, or to make detail. You can make it with a very large brush"
Bob Ross,Its just a matter of practicing a little until it works for you and youre comfortable with it. There. Okay. Now then
Bob Ross,"Lets take, well use the old script liner brush, little bit of white, Im gonna reach down here and get a little titanium white, mix em together, maybe get a little more of the paint thinner on here"
Bob Ross,"Want this paint to be very thin, almost the consistency of ink. In fact, you can see it running there. Very thin. Lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"And here, we just put the indication of some little tree trunks here and there. A little more of the white. Yeah, thats better, now you can see em a little bit better"
Bob Ross,"And well put a few limbs and stems and all the little things that you need to hold up these happy little trees in here. Okay. Shoot, Ill tell you what, there might even be one over here. Who knows"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you want em. There. While I have that old brush going, Im gonna go into straight Van Dyke brown, same way, thin, very thin. Maybe, yeah. Lets do this"
Bob Ross,Maybe theres a little fence back here by the pond. Just goes right on down out of sight. And we can see some old rails still on the post. Makes it sort of interesting. Just breaks it up
Bob Ross,"Ill take a little light color, just put a little highlight on some of these. There. And we got a happy little fence that lives way back in the distance"
Bob Ross,"Back to our brush that has our greens and yellows on it. Little more of the sap green, oh there we go. Nice. Lets go back in here, and just begin tapping in some little grassy areas"
Bob Ross,"And while youre doing that, you know I get a lot of letters from fantastic people all over the country that send pictures of what theyre painting at home, from watching the show, and Id like to"
Bob Ross,share some of those with you. You would not believe what people are doing. This makes it all worthwhile
Bob Ross,"And a lot of people that are sending paintings have never had a painting lesson in their life, other than watching the television series. And this is what theyre accomplishing"
Bob Ross,"And maybe most important, it makes people understand and believe that they can do this. You dont have to be somebody special. Anybody can do this. You really can"
Bob Ross,"And that truly is the joy of painting, when you produce something like this, you know what a pleasure it is to give someone a gift that youve produced yourself"
Bob Ross,"Or to hang it in your home, and people come by and they say, You didnt do that. chuckles You didnt do that.  People wont believe that you can paint like that. But you can. You really can"
Bob Ross,"And every day, as I say, I see more and more evidences of it. Every day. Shoot, lets have fun. Maybe, in our world, lets have another little watery spot right here"
Bob Ross,"Just, just to break up the monotony a little"
Bob Ross,"There, just a little white, cause we have some blue, well, and we can add a little phthalo blue to the brush, if we want to, just to give it a little blue tone. There, okay. A little white"
Bob Ross,"And then, once again, just pull across. And now we have another happy little pond, right out here"
Bob Ross,"And, we can take our little grassy color, and lets come right down, and bring a little thing, a little peninsula right off into there. That easy"
Bob Ross,"You can just push that rascal right back in the distance. And just as many layers as you want of nice, beautiful areas down in there"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, while we have this old brush going, lets go right up here. There we are. And lets just put some little sparklers on these trees. They need some nice little highlights on em too"
Bob Ross,There. And all were using is just the corner of the brush. Just the corner
Bob Ross,"There We load it exactly the same way as we did to make the grassy areas down below, but all were using is the corner, and going in the direction that we want these little limbs to hang here"
Bob Ross,"Touch a little bit of the bright red here, and lets put a little sparkler right in there. Ooh, thats nice. Like him"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little yellow ochre, well give him a little friend that lives right there, and you can just vary these colors, back and forth, and put in all kinds of little things"
Bob Ross,"Alright, maybe on the other side over here, well give this tree some nice little highlights. And Im just using the opposite corner. There. Okay. But think about shape and form in your tree"
Bob Ross,"I know you get tired of hearing me say that, but thats probably the single most important thing, when youre making these trees. Its more important than what you use to make them with"
Bob Ross,"Its the fact that you give them form and shape. There we are. And thats whats gonna make your painting so special. And, the other thing, try to leave some dark areas at the base of your tree"
Bob Ross,"That gives the illusion of a big shadow underneath there. And it creates depth, once again"
Bob Ross,"Or if you feel that somethings needed in there, make it something very dark, like a very, very dark, dark green that you wont see so much. There. See, like that. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Lets go back to our little fan brush here that has the Van Dyke brown on it, and we can just, here and there, put a little touch of the brown to give the indication of a little dirt down there"
Bob Ross,"Lets take, lets have some fun. I like to do this. Well take a little liquid white, a little bit of dark sienna, a little Van Dyke brown, were gonna make a very thin paint here"
Bob Ross,"Just the consistency of liquid white, with a little bit of flavor in it. And well take our little filbert"
Bob Ross,"Well go right into Van Dyke brown, little dark sienna, just mix em together, but a lot of color on each side of the brush, a lot of color"
Bob Ross,And well go right down here and pull one side through this thin color
Bob Ross,"And, lets put, just the indication of some little stones that live, theres one out in the water, that live out here in our world. Wherever you want em"
Bob Ross,"And we can come back, little touch of the liquid white, go right in here, and just clean the bottom of em up some. There"
Bob Ross,"But isnt that a sneaky little, nice way of making some very effective little stones out here in your water. Tell you what lets do. Lets take a pull the contact paper off. And see what we have"
Bob Ross,"Alright. And you know me. laughs I never leave well enough alone. I think today, Ill just use the old fan brush that has the Van Dyke brown on it, and in our world, stand back and sorta look"
Bob Ross,"I like to have something that sorta projects right out of the scene when we do these little ovals. I just, I think thats neat. And maybe when you do yours, you dont want to have this big tree here"
Bob Ross,"Its up to you. Its really up to you. I just sorta like these. Now, lets put a little background material behind the tree. Just a dark color. Maybe theres a little bush back here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this little bush comes right over. That way, itll push everything back. Hows that. Maybe it just sorta disappears into nothing. Whatever. Anyway that you want it"
Bob Ross,Back to our old two-inch brush that has the highlight colors on it
Bob Ross,"Put the least little touch of paint thinner on the brush so the paintll be much thinner, because were getting in quite a few layers of color here"
Bob Ross,"And as you know, the thin paint will stick to the thick paint. Thin to thick. And, maybe theres another one here. Just all kinds of little bushes. Get a little more of the sap green"
Bob Ross,"Lets just tap in some little grassy areas that just flow right down from there. Just like that. Now, sometimes its fun to do little things"
Bob Ross,"You have to make big decisions when you paint, because you have unlimited power. see, this tree right now, get a closeup on this tree. It looks like its behind those bushes. Now watch"
Bob Ross,"But pulling this through, we just put the tree in front of the bushes. chuckles And well put in a big old root that hangs out right down there. Shoot, see what you can do. Now"
Bob Ross,"Lets take paint thinner, were going to Van Dyke brown, well load a lot of color there. A lot of color. Very thin. Maybe hes got a little buddy. A little friend, lives right there"
Bob Ross,"Got a couple little arms on him, like that. There we go. There. Just a little guy that lives here"
Bob Ross,"Now, sometimes its fun, just load the liner brush with the Van Dyke brown and dark sienna mixture, then pull just one side through a little bit of that liquid white with a little color in it"
Bob Ross,"And you can make a nice thing thats already highlighted, that easy"
Bob Ross,"And if you wanna highlight the whole tree, we can take a little of that thin color on the liner brush, you can do it with a knife, whatever"
Bob Ross,"And just blend it back, so it gets darker, darker, darker as it works around the tree. Look at there. Isnt that sneaky. And it works so easy. Youll like it. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now then, a little more of the paint thinner, and lets just begin putting some nice little limbs off this. There we go. And you put as many or as few as you want in your world"
Bob Ross,Just sort of let em go. And this is where it really pays if you got a little twitch in your hand. There
Bob Ross,Because you can make all these beautiful little limbs and dont want em all just exactly straight. Limbs grow every which way. Let em grow. Let em go. Just wherever you want em
Bob Ross,"Maybe right theres a old big one that comes right on off. There. Something like that. Okay, now, lets go down here, take a little of that Van Dyke brown, lets just do this real quick"
Bob Ross,"Take a little white, a little dark sienna, come right down here, and just barely touch, put the indication maybe of a little bit of grass down here"
Bob Ross,"And we can just take a fan brush, finish this thing up, pop in a few little happy bushes, right along the base here. And it makes one of the most interesting paintings"
Bob Ross,"I hope you try this one, cause I know that youll really like it. And when you show this one to people, theyll certainly get excited. Hope youve enjoyed this one"
Bob Ross,"From all of us here, happy painting, God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,"instrumental music - Voiceover This program is brought to you by North Light Books, publisher of over 200 how-to books and videos for fine artists and graphic designers"
Bob Ross,"And by Langnickel, manufacturers of selected artist brushes"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Lets do a fantastic little painting together"
Bob Ross,"So tell you what, lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us"
Bob Ross,"And theyll come across, as usual, In the same order as I have them on the palette, starting with the white and working around. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got done up here"
Bob Ross,"I have my standard old pre-stretched, double-prime canvas up here. I use an 18 by 24, but you use whatever size is convenient"
Bob Ross,"Now, today Ive covered the entire canvas with a thin, and let me say that again, a thin, thin even coat of liquid clear"
Bob Ross,"Now when youre using this clear, I say thin several times because you need such a very, very small amount. Its transparent, you cant see it. Theres a tendency to put too much on. Very little"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and with that, lets just have a good time today. Im gonna take little yellow ochre maybe. Little bit of yellow ochre. Lets just do a winter scene today thats very nice"
Bob Ross,"Ill be right back, let me get a little, little dark sienna mixed in with it. A little winter scene that is warm. Lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes winter scenes can become so cold, theyre almost unpleasant. So lets do one today that has a lot of just beautiful little things happening in it"
Bob Ross,"And we just start out and use a two-inch brush and just make little circles and little patterns, just let all these little things just happen. There you go. This is a time to have fun. Just enjoy this"
Bob Ross,"Let it work and play. But try not to, I dont want to have just a dead old flat sky today. I want to have something that has movement and life in it, and is interesting, and its fun"
Bob Ross,"So by doing these little circles, going one way a while, then go the other way a while. Look at what happens. Look at all the forms and shapes that are happening. Just automatically"
Bob Ross,"Okay, a little more color. Put a little over in here. There. And try not to stay in one area and keep working it. Because itll just look like its dead. Its not interesting. There we are"
Bob Ross,"And this clear does not dilute the color. If you had liquid white on the canvas like wed normally use, it would dilute the color, because it would blend with it. And the white would continually mix"
Bob Ross,And today I thought wed just do something where we dont mix color. Alright. Maybe just a touch more color. We put a little something right up in here
Bob Ross,"Alright, boy that is a fantastic way of making a very effective little sky. Now then. Now comes the fun part. Lets wash the old brush"
Bob Ross,"If youve painted with me before, you know thats the most interesting part of this whole technique. And we wash our brushes, as usual, with odorless paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Just shake off the excess and, cover everybody in about a two-block radius"
Bob Ross,"When youre doing this at home, you might want to get a little brush beater rack that you put down in the bottom of a waste paper basket, and itll save your happy home. Okay, now"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna take a little bit of titanium white, right on that same old two-inch brush. Just a little, we dont need much. And lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"And lets just start, maybe thisll be our light area. And lets just sort of bounce that around. Just bounce it around, let it play. There. Im using just the corner of the brush, though. Okay now"
Bob Ross,Sometimes its nice to leave the sky like we had it a minute ago. Sometimes its nice to take like this and add highlights to it. Its up to you
Bob Ross,"This piece of canvas is truly your world, and you can do anything here that makes you happy"
Bob Ross,"Its such a fantastic day here, I thought Id put a little bright spot in the sky, and I hope the painting brings a little brightness to your life when you do it"
Bob Ross,"But we dont need a great deal, I just want a little. Because I dont want to lose all these beautiful patterns that we have up here"
Bob Ross,"There, a little more white, you can make this as bright as you want it, and the more you blend it, of course, the more the dark sienna and yellow ochre will mix in there and dilute it. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Maybe just the least little touch right in here. Just so theres a little contrast in there. Maybe in our world, theres a little bit of light that zings right through that little cloud. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, very lightly. Two hairs and some air, we can just blend that out. Alright. And that makes a very good, very effective little sky that you can do in just a couple of minutes"
Bob Ross,"And once again, we get to wash the old brush. Alright. Okay. I tell you what lets do. Lets mix up, lets make a little lavender color"
Bob Ross,"Well use a little alizarin crimson, a little touch of phthalo blue. Proportionately, much, much much much much more of the blue than crimson. Okay, and well put a little white out here"
Bob Ross,"And dilute that color down. Just value it down. Ooh, thats a nice lavender color. Alright, well grab the old two-inch brush here. Lets just take a two-inch brush and tap the corner"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna tap the corner, see. Right into a little bit of that color. Were not getting a great deal of paint on the brush"
Bob Ross,"Well go up in here, and maybe in our world there lives just the indication of some very, very soft little bushes back in here"
Bob Ross,"And all were using is the top corner of the two-inch brush, and with this we can form basic shapes. And thats all were looking for"
Bob Ross,"I dont want these to be too distinct, because then theyll look like theyre too close to us. I want these to be far back in the distance. Very basic little shapes. Alright, very good"
Bob Ross,Something about like that. And wherever you think they should be
Bob Ross,"And you can vary these a little bit, some of them be a little darker than others, and the ones that are lighter like that, when the painting is finished, will look like theyre much much farther away"
Bob Ross,"So if you put one in front of it thats a little darker, itll help strengthen that illusion. Alright. Sometimes we can even take the brush and just push sideways like that"
Bob Ross,Itll make it look like a little tree thats far back in there. There we go. Little bit more of the color. Put a little darker one right here in the foreground. Whatever you want
Bob Ross,"Just let your imagination go when youre doing these. Okay. Now sometimes, Ill show you a little trick. Let me show you something thats a great deal of fun. Okay, let me get a clean brush"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its fun to just dip just the corner of the brush, just the corner, into a little paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Because we have liquid clear up here, paint thinner and liquid clear have almost a violent reaction when you put them together"
Bob Ross,"And you can take and just flick a little paint thinner on there, just like so. Let me get just a touch more. And you can do this with a fan brush or whatever"
Bob Ross,"But everywhere that paint thinner touches, itll begin to remove the paint"
Bob Ross,"That means little dots will appear, and it looks like little leaves and stuff that are way back here on your little trees and all that"
Bob Ross,"But its just a very neat little way of making a lot of effects very quickly, very easily. And people will go crazy trying to figure out how youve done this"
Bob Ross,"Okay, but be careful that you dont get too much paint thinner. There, that should be about enough for what were doing. Okay. Isnt that sneaky"
Bob Ross,"But try that, you will be absolutely amazed, and it takes a couple of minutes. As this painting progresses, youll begin to see these little spots appear"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets take, put another layer of little things in there. For that well use yellow ochre, be right back, and dark sienna. Just yellow ochre and dark sienna mixed together. Like that"
Bob Ross,"Lets go back up here. Now then, right in front of these lavender little bushes, Im going to begin to just put an indication of some happy little things that live right in here that are this color"
Bob Ross,"Just varying the colors back and forth here. Back and forth. Little Indian yellow here and there. There. Okay, now Im gonna go back to the lavender"
Bob Ross,"And all Im doing, Im not even cleaning the brush, Im just sort of working back and forth, so you have all kinds of different little things happening in here"
Bob Ross,"Add this least little touch of the cad yellow. This is cadmium yellow. Make that a little bit brighter, right here. Because heres our light source, right above it"
Bob Ross,"That way its a little bit brighter right in there. Be careful with the cadmium yellow, itll eat up your whole world here in a minute. We dont want too much of it. Going back to the lavender color"
Bob Ross,"And if lavender and yellow get together, it just makes brown, and in this painting, thats wonderful. We dont mind at all. Dont mind at all. There. Now then. Theres one thats a little bit lighter"
Bob Ross,But see all the different layers that you can create. Just with the top point of a great big old brush. Little touch of more of the Indian yellow there. Thats gorgeous
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe back here in our world, lets have a few little tree branches and sticks and twigs, and for that, well just use that same lavender color, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"You can use anything that you like. But think well just use that lavender. A little paint thinner, go into that, turn the brush. That brings it to a nice sharp point, loads the bristles full of paint"
Bob Ross,"Okay. Now, maybe in our world, there lives a little tree right back there. There. Put some arms on him. There we go. Little sticks and twigs. Just wherever you think they should be"
Bob Ross,"Let your imagination take you anywhere that you want to go. There we are. And put them in the different layers, so that they layer all in different planes"
Bob Ross,"That helps separate the different planes in your painting. Get a touch more of the paint thinner. Maybe, yep, lets put a big one right here"
Bob Ross,"Now the paint thinners gonna react against the liquid clear thats on the canvas, and these will start turning whitish. So theyll look like theyre highlighted without you hardly doing a thing"
Bob Ross,It will take a few minutes for that to happen. As the paint thinner and the clear begin to react. Use this reaction to your advantage. You can make some fantastic things. A little darker color
Bob Ross,"Who knows, maybe theres a, oh there we are, oh that one, it goes right over like that"
Bob Ross,"If youve painted with me before, you know I dont like all my trees to just be perfectly straight, I like trees that have character. I like trees that are like people"
Bob Ross,"Theyre all different, and theyre all wonderful. There we are. You just sometimes have to look for the good, but its there. Always there. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Maybe on the other side, well have a couple over here. Im gonna add the least little touch of dark sienna to that too. So we just change the flavor a little maybe"
Bob Ross,"Or you could add a little of the Van Dyke brown, whatever. Just so we have some variety here. I dont want all my little trees to look exactly the same. Theres one. And however many you want"
Bob Ross,"We could even take a little of the titanium white and thin it down, and here and there, you have one thats white. Because there are always a lot of little white sticks and twigs in the woods"
Bob Ross,"Okay, good. Now then. Maybe down in here, tell you what lets do, lets take a little of that alizarin crimson, a little phthalo blue, Im just making some more lavender is all Im doing"
Bob Ross,"Im just making it on the brush, because Im about out. And lets just put some color down here. Right on top of the clear. This will just end up being, maybe well have snow and this will be shadows"
Bob Ross,"Or if you wanted to have water, this could end up being your water. But I think today Ill just have some snow there"
Bob Ross,"Well grab another two-inch brush, and well go into just pure titanium white, nothing else. Pure old titanium white. And well start back here, and just begin laying in some snow"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna bring this snow all the way up here, and while Im doing that, I wanna share with you one of the most fantastic little creatures that youve ever seen. Because thisll all be just the same"
Bob Ross,"This is a little deer that Diana Schafer there brought, brought here to the station for us to see. Shes the bird lady here in Muncie. This deer was found right outside of Muncie, in a farmers field"
Bob Ross,"And it had been orphaned, and Diana has raised this little deer, and today its been set free, and he really is doing fantastic. But I had such a good time with this little fella"
Bob Ross,"I spent several hours just playing with him, and I thank Diana for sharing that with us. He is absolutely gorgeous. We didnt even name him"
Bob Ross,But it always looks like Bambi to me when I see a little deer. Isnt he something. That has to be one of the most gorgeous creatures God has ever made
Bob Ross,Id like to take him home and just keep him as a pet. But thats not what hes meant to be. Hes meant to be free. So I say hes already been turned loose. This was shot about three months ago. There
Bob Ross,"But isnt he the most beautiful little thing. I get to watching the deer, I have a monitor here. I get watching the deer and quit painting. Anyway, all Im doing here is just taking titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Pay attention to the angles, though. Angles are very important when youre doing snow. All I wanna do is make it look like theres a little place right in here, like that"
Bob Ross,"And by paying attention to the angles, see how easy that is to do. And already, you see the illusion of distance coming through here. There we are. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Okay, we can take, well use a fan brush, what the heck. And well get some of those same colors. Dark sienna, yellow ochre. A little bit of cad yellow, little Indian yellow. Just mix them together"
Bob Ross,"I always like to mix color on the brush, that way you have a variety of colors on the brush. Its just not one dead old color. And we go up here, and here and there and there and here"
Bob Ross,"See, now we can begin putting some little, little things here, that breaks up that straight line, looks like little weeds that are growing right out here, just push up with the fan brush, all you have"
Bob Ross,"to do. Just push up with the fan brush. There. Wherever you think they should be. Now well take another fan brush, and I have several going. Just plain titanium white"
Bob Ross,"And we can clean these edges up right here, just grab it, pull it, be sure to follow the same angles though. But that easy. Snow is one of the easiest things to paint in this method. No problem"
Bob Ross,"When I was a traditional painter, I used to labor over things like snow and reflections. My gosh, reflections are one of those things that just drove you crazy"
Bob Ross,"In this technique, it is absolutely the easiest thing there is to do. There"
Bob Ross,"And then we can take a little bit more of that lavender that we had on the liner brush, and maybe here and there, put the indication of some little sticks and twigs that live right out in here"
Bob Ross,"They dont all live in the background, some live up here, a little closer. Okay. Shoot, you know me. You know me. This is such a beautiful spot"
Bob Ross,"Id have to have me a little cabin out here, and this is where Id like to stay. You could stay out here and watch that little deer grow up. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Lets start with a little bit of Van Dyke brown on the knife, the first decision we have to make is where is our cabin gonna live. I think today well put a little cabin right here"
Bob Ross,"Start a little Van Dyke brown, and well paint the back eve of the little cabin first"
Bob Ross,"Then well load the knife full of titanium white, and theres snow on our roof, so well put in the other side of the roof. That easy. Maybe our cabins gonna be about there. And see how easy it is"
Bob Ross,"Just drop that little rascal right in there. Now, we just come back, and well put some wood in here for the front, and Im just still using Van Dyke brown, this is just a base color"
Bob Ross,"Well come back and highlight it a little bit. Just touch and pull. Touch it and pull. All were doing is just blocking in color right here. Okay, a little bit right here. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now Im gonna take white and dark sienna, and a little bit of the Van Dyke all mixed together. But not overmixed, I want it left marbled like that"
Bob Ross,"A very small level of paint, then we can go up here, and with no pressure, just touch and pull down. No pressure though, no pressure. Absolutely no pressure. Let the paint break"
Bob Ross,"Make the wood look old. Then you can play back and forth. You want a little shadow up here. You take a little dark, pull down, see there. That wood looks so old, its unreal"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe take some more of the Van Dyke brown. Maybe we have, in our cabin, maybe theres a door right there. Gotta have a way to get in"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this is a spectacular cabin, maybe it has a window right here. And we can do that. Just take a little of the brown, lay in. Shoot, who knows. Take the small knife, its just the right size"
Bob Ross,"Over here, maybe theres another window. We can have as many windows in our cabin as we want, shoot. Take a little light color, just sorta outline this so it stands out. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Same over here, just a little highlight so it looks like a little lights playing across the window there. Shoot, you can even get crazy and put curtains in there if you want to"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can take a little Van Dyke brown and make the indication of old boards just by touching. Just by touching. Now, time to get our proportions correct"
Bob Ross,"So we just take the knife and do a cabinectomy. See, you can cut that old cabin off anywhere you want it. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"Fan brush, a little bit of titanium white, and we can bring that snow right up to the door. Right up to the door"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its nice, if you wanna be sneaky, take a touch of that little dark lavender here, little bit, make the indication, maybe somebodys walked in and out of here a couple times"
Bob Ross,"Just the indication of a little path that goes up in there. There havent been many people here, so I dont want to do, I dont want to do a whole bunch"
Bob Ross,"If you had a lot of people living here, then that little deer would go away. And we want to keep him"
Bob Ross,"Alright, lets take a little bit of dark sienna, a little bit of yellow ochre, tap it together here"
Bob Ross,"And lets go right up in here, right up here, and just tap in the indication of some little bushes that live on this side. There we are. See"
Bob Ross,"Maybe they come, I dont know, maybe this little bush comes right down here. This guy, maybe hes like me, and he doesnt cut the yard very often, and its growing up over. There"
Bob Ross,"Im not a very good yard keeper. Okay, tell you what lets do. Maybe over here on the other side, we need something to fill this up"
Bob Ross,"Lets just take, still just using the top corner of the old two-inch brush. You can do fantastic things with very few brushes if you just practice and make friends with them a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Now Im going back to the yellow ochres, Indian yellow, a little touch of cad yellow here and there"
Bob Ross,"And also, here and there, a little bit of titanium white, just so you can see different layers, just to lighten. Something like so. Maybe down like that"
Bob Ross,"When you do yours, just sort of look at it, and youll see things happening in it. Use those little things that happen, dont fight them. Take a little white on the two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Put a little indication of snow right there. There. See, and itll push all that back in there. Same thing on the other side, maybe this snow bank comes right down, like that. Who knows. Only you do"
Bob Ross,"Only you do, in your world, youre the only one who knows. Okay, good. Okay, see there. That easy"
Bob Ross,"And then like before, we can take the little fan brush and just tap in some little grassy areas thatre living right out here. Some over on this side, too. Just a few"
Bob Ross,"Another fan brush with white, just like before, clean up the bottom. And a little over here. Alright. I think its time to have some fun. You know me. I like those big trees"
Bob Ross,"Lets go into Van Dyke brown, dark sienna, just mix them together on the brush, it doesnt matter. And maybe in our world, here we go"
Bob Ross,"I get letters sometimes, people say, you had the most beautiful painting, and then you put that big old tree in it, and I dont like it anymore"
Bob Ross,"But when you do your painting, thats the beauty of this. If you dont want a big tree in your world, leave it out. Thats the beauty"
Bob Ross,Thats why we dont do any tracings here or we dont do any drawing
Bob Ross,"When were teaching our instructors, thats one of the things that we emphasize, we want to teach people creativity, not just to copy"
Bob Ross,"Not just to copy, thats very important to me, that you learn creativity, because it makes you feel good in here"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little dark sienna, and white, mostly white, and just tap right along this edge here, and put the indication of a little hightlight on this old tree"
Bob Ross,"But I like to tap this because it looks fuzzy, and to me a lot of times, especially evergreens, look fuzzy, and the edges and the bark are all ragged"
Bob Ross,"If you want a straight tree, just pull it straight down and make it with a knife. I just happen to like those kind of trees. Now, paint thinner. Get a little more paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Go right into those same two browns. Make the paint thin like ink. And lets go right up in here, and maybe in our tree, theres a big old limb, hangs right down like that. There he is. See"
Bob Ross,"Putting some little arms out here. Maybe this is an old evergreen tree. And they have just a lot of little sticks and twigs and things that hang off of them. There. Okay, see all those little rascals"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a big old limb, lives right there. But think like a tree when youre doing this. If you were a tree, where would you want an arm. Maybe something like so. As many or as few as you want"
Bob Ross,"There, look at all them old rascals. Maybe this one comes up and goes around. Whatever. But isnt that a fantastic little painting. Its a good way to use the liquid clear. Try it"
Bob Ross,"I think youll really enjoy it. And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. cheerful music"
Bob Ross,"Hi. Welcome. Certainly glad to see ya again. Today I thought wed do a fantastic little painting on a black canvas, as you can plainly see"
Bob Ross,"Today I have my standard ole pre-stretched canvas, but Ive taken black gesso, and Ive sorta just painted a little thing like this with a foam brush, and Ive left the center unpainted, but Ive"
Bob Ross,"graduated that black gesso into it. You start out here, and as you lose all your black gesso itll happen automatically. Then weve covered the whole area with a little tiny, tiny bit of liquid clear"
Bob Ross,"On top of that, Ive just put a mixture of alizarin crimson and phthalo blue. Proportionally, much more crimson than blue. I want it sorta to the reddish side. Thats how weve got this prepared"
Bob Ross,"I thought today wed just do a very warm little painting. I think youll like it. Its a lotta fun to do, and I really think youll enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out with a little 2-inch brush, a little bit of the titanium white, just load some on, no big deal how we get it on there"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna go right up here in this light area, and Im gonna start and just make little criss-cross strokes, just little criss-cross strokes"
Bob Ross,"Its beginning to pick up that color thats already on the canvas, and immediately beautiful things will begin to happen"
Bob Ross,"If this is gonna be our light source right here, then we start in the center and work around. That way, itll progressively get darker as it goes out. Once again, that also will happen automatically"
Bob Ross,"You dont have to worry about it. All you gotta do is start at the center, and work outward. You can do this in any transparent color"
Bob Ross,"This is also very pretty to do in just phthalo blue or sap green, any of these colors that are transparent"
Bob Ross,"If you wanna find out if a color is transparent, just take a little bit and rub it on black gesso, and if the black area still looks black, then its transparent enough to do what were doing here"
Bob Ross,"Let me wash the ole brush. We wash our brushes, as you know, with odorless paint thinner. Just shake off the excess, brush rattles against bucket chuckling and beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,You can go back as many times as you want into the center area to make it as bright as you desire. Lets load the brush again
Bob Ross,"I do recommend that you clean the brush between each application of this white paint, otherwise youre gonna take that dirty color right back into the center, and youll lose your brightness"
Bob Ross,Start in the light area and work outward. Always working outward. Make the little criss-cross strokes because thats easier to blend
Bob Ross,"Instead of having big circles, little criss-cross strokes blend out quite nicely. There. Lets just keep working it outward here. I want to keep the edges of this quite dark"
Bob Ross,"Dont want it to get too bright, but when youre doing yours, you might want it to be very, very bright, and you can do that"
Bob Ross,Color stands out so much more on a black background than it does on a white background. You wont believe the difference. This black gesso may be one of the neatest things Ive ever come up with
Bob Ross,"Alright, now then, lets see what we have. Just put a little in this corner up here. Very lightly, we just brush across, and thatll remove the brush strokes"
Bob Ross,"Theres a lot of action happening in the sky. If you wanted to smooth it, banging brush Ive got several brushes going here, you can take a clean brush, and just blend it"
Bob Ross,"I sorta like having some of these little action things happening, but its up to you. If you wanna make it smoother, if you keep blending it like this, you can make it so it looks absolutely like silk"
Bob Ross,"Just like silk, very smooth and very nice. brush swishing Alright. Now we have us a light source. Lets have some fun today. Tell ya what, lets use the old round brush here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna mix up alizarin crimson and phthalo blue. Well just mix those two together. Once again, we have much more crimson than we do blue. I want this to be a lavender color, but to the bluish side"
Bob Ross,"knife tapping palette Its very difficult to tell when youre mixing color like this what color you have. Sometimes put a little white out there, and then you can see what color it is"
Bob Ross,"And thats just what Im looking for. Alright. Lets take ole round brush, and Im just gonna tap it right into that color, just tap it. Lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,I want some little trees that live back here in the background. This round brush is one of the neatest foliage brushes that youve ever seen
Bob Ross,It makes background foliage probably better than any brush that we have. Its so nice and easy. All you have to do is tap. There. brush tapping Make some beautiful little background trees
Bob Ross,Be a nice place for my little squirrel to live. I tell ya what
Bob Ross,"Weve got so many requests about that little squirrel, this is all gonna be just the same, Im gonna tap in some little trees, Im gonna show you my little rascal again here"
Bob Ross,"That son-of-a-gun, he can tear up an eye dropper in a heartbeat, and if youve seen this one before, this is the one that we named Pea Pod the Pocket Squirrel cause he wants to live in your pocket"
Bob Ross,"all the time. I think if you allowed him to, he would stay there 24 hours a day. I raised him ever since he was just a small baby"
Bob Ross,"In only a few more months, hell be ready to turn loose and out on his own, have his own family. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Im still just tapping in some basic little background shapes here, just to create the illusion of foliage way in the background. Ok, very good. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Lets put a few little highlights here and there. For that, I have another round brush. I have several, so I dont have to spend all my time just washing brushes"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little touch of the alizarin crimson, a little bit of cad yellow, a little yellow ochre, I wanna make this a very bright little painting in the background"
Bob Ross,"Some beautiful warm colors, a little bright red in there, too. Phew, thats nice, sort of an orange color. Lets go right up in here and maybe, maybe yup, youre right, looka there"
Bob Ross,"A little light just zings right through there and just lights up that little bush, just lights him up. Now, lets take, Im gonna take just titanium white and bright red"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna make some beautiful little colors here. Thisll be sort of a hot pink color. Once again, just tap it right onto the bristles. Just touch, phew, look at that"
Bob Ross,"These are the kind of paintings, though, that you can put in a room, and itll warm it up. It will absolutely just warm it up. Once again, you can do this in any color"
Bob Ross,"Its such a fantastic day here, I feel like doin it in cheery, bright colors, but maybe youd like to do it in greens or something. That can be just as striking"
Bob Ross,"Im adding a little touch of the phthalo blue to that same pile now, just varying the colors back and forth. Now were going to a cool color. Blue is a very cool color"
Bob Ross,"Put it right next to the warm colors, and it just makes a striking contrast. Maybe another one of those. I like that. Right there. You make the decision"
Bob Ross,"You make the decision, wherever you think they should be. brush tapping There. Didnt that brush make some beautiful little things very, very simply. There we go. Another one right there. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now, take a little bit more of the white, little more of that bright red"
Bob Ross,"Once again, Im just going back and forth between these various colors, but I want em to be warm against cool and cool against warm"
Bob Ross,"The pinks against the blues, vice versa, thats whatll really, really turn people on when they see your painting. There we go. Lets go right over in here"
Bob Ross,"Take this little one, maybe bring it right on down like that. And here and there, there and here, Im gonna add the least little touch of sap green to our color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe here and there we can see a little green in some of these bushes, but its gonna be a very light green. I dont want any dark greens back here"
Bob Ross,"It would change the whole mood if you was to put a dark, dark green in there, just a nice sparkly little green. If you notice, some of em here have been left unpainted"
Bob Ross,"That really makes it look like a deep shadow, and that was done intentionally. There we go. brush tapping Maybe a little touch right in here"
Bob Ross,"Once again, I want to leave some of those up in the background unpainted. Makes em look like theyre really far away. Super"
Bob Ross,"Lets take our little script liner brush, and Im gonna dip that in some paint thinner and go right into the lavender color"
Bob Ross,"We want this paint to be thin, almost, looka there, it runs, its almost like ink. Turn the bristles in there. That brings it to a very sharp point and loads it full of color. Need a lot of color, ok"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres some little tree trunks that we can see just here and there. These little delicate things in here really give depth and dimension to your painting, cause theyre always in the woods"
Bob Ross,"I know were not interested in goin out and makin a happy buck or two, but if youre out selling your paintings, and Ive said this so many times before, this is what separates your painting from"
Bob Ross,"other peoples is this little bit of extra in it. Makes you special, and we know that youre special. There. brush splashing in liquid Now then, its time to really have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Lets take an old 2-inch brush here. In my world, maybe Im gonna have some little grassy areas thatll come right down through there"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take, first Ima put a little touch of that same lavender color on this 2-inch brush, and then Im gonna go right down, there we are, to the yellow"
Bob Ross,"I put that lavender on there so when I touch this yellow, Ill get varying shades of green, and Ill go into the yellow ochre, the Indian yellow"
Bob Ross,"Once in a while, Ill bounce a little bit into the bright red. Ill just vary these back and forth. Tap the brush, giving it a little push, so it creates that little ridge of paint"
Bob Ross,You can see it right along there. Thats what were looking for. Theres another one on the end of the brush. Thats what we work with. Lets go up here
Bob Ross,You have to think about the lay of the land already. Maybe our lands gonna flow something about like that
Bob Ross,"Begin thinking about how you want this to lay or to flow, whatever you wanna call it, lay of the land, the way the land flows. Everybody has their own idea of what you call it"
Bob Ross,"Little more of the color. Go right back up in here. Now I want it to get darker as it gets back in here, darker, darker, so you can tap it more or just use less and less pressure on the brush"
Bob Ross,Well sort of vary. Well go into a little more of the yellow ochre here and there. You can change the planes in here or the lay of the land just by doing that
Bob Ross,"See, it leaves a little indentation in there, and it creates interest in your painting. brush tapping That easy. Ok, little touch right in here like so. There we are"
Bob Ross,Things will begin appearing if you just start out with a general idea. You dont really have to plan each and every little thing here. Itll just actually start appearing if you just let it work
Bob Ross,"Let the paint work, the canvas work. Shoot. Now, sometimes its fun to take your brush and go into a small amount of titanium white. Just load a little tiny bit on there"
Bob Ross,"There you can see I think, just a very small amount. I dont want much. Think where youre lights coming from, and just pick out a area or two and let that really shine"
Bob Ross,"Itll look like theres light just zinging right through there. Itll really, really sparkle your painting up. Just think where it would hit, but dont overdo"
Bob Ross,"This gets feeling good, and its real easy to overdo. Then it absolutely will lose its effectiveness. Back to our darker colors, just add in some little things here and there. Alright. You know me"
Bob Ross,"chuckles I like water, and that would be a perfect place for a little stream. Im gonna dip the fan brush into liquid white, go into titanium white. Ill be right back"
Bob Ross,"Get the least, least little touch of phthalo blue. So we have liquid white, titanium white and phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"The liquid whites in there only to thin the paint, because a thin paint, as you know, will slide right over the top of a thick paint. Lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"With this thinner paint on the brush, in my mind, right about in here, theres gonna live shoo, a happy little water fall, see. Pull it straight, and then go down. Over and down, like that"
Bob Ross,"Decide how big your waterfall is, push upward, create a little foam, now we can let that waterfall just work right down here. Its gonna pick up the color that we put on that black gesso"
Bob Ross,"We have that nice lavender color on there. Shoo oops, looka there, fell over again. Water got trapped in there and fell right over"
Bob Ross,"Just make up little stories and let the water go bloop, wherever you think that little bloop should happen. That easy"
Bob Ross,"That easy you can create the illusion of a little stream thats just bubbling and playing, probably some little trout live in there. This is a place my little squirrel would like to live"
Bob Ross,This certainly is a lovely spot. Hed have a good time here. Good time here. Hope you like seein those little rascals. They play a very important part of my life
Bob Ross,"Right now, I have five little squirrels and two crows. Ive talked about the little crow in another series, both of em had been injured by guns, people shooting em, just for the heck of it"
Bob Ross,"Im not opposed to hunting, but Im certainly opposed to people just shooting things just for the pleasure of shooting em. Dont wanna get on that soap box. Lets go back here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take some of that lavender color. brush tapping Take the old 2-inch brush, and maybe, lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, theres a big tree that lives right over here on this side and watches over the waterfall, so we need some dark. The dark is in here only so we can put light on top of it"
Bob Ross,"Thats all were putting it in here for. Somethin about like that, just to give us a basic shape. In this tree, Im gonna make a light blue here"
Bob Ross,"Actually, its more of a bluish-gray color, and maybe theres a happy little tree trunk that lives in our tree, right about there. See. There"
Bob Ross,"Well put leaves I think on this tree, so we dont need too much, just a little bit of this might show. Somethin like that. Now we can go back to our old 2-inch brush. What the heck"
Bob Ross,"You could use 1-inch, 2-inch, anything. Well use this. Its handy, and its already got paint on it. Well go more into the yellow ochre on this one. Lets go right up here"
Bob Ross,"Now, using just the corner of the brush, lets come in here and put the indication of all kinds of just beautiful little foliage on this tree, just wherever you think it should live. There"
Bob Ross,"But work in patterns, layers. Think about the shape of the tree, just dont throw it on at random, or thats what itll look like. There, see theres another little batch right there"
Bob Ross,"And maybe, maybe, maybe in our world yep maybe theres another little bush that lives right here underneath this tree. Just make up little things"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well put some grass that comes right down here, just a little. Little grassy bank that lives there. Well decide where that goes later. Time to have some real fun. Lets take some liquid white"
Bob Ross,"Well put it out, and I have quite a bit of liquid white. Im gonna take dark sienna and Van Dyke brown, and mix it with that liquid white. We make a brown color thats very thin, very thin, ok"
Bob Ross,"We go back up here. Lets use our filbert brush today. Im gonna take the filbert brush and go through the two browns, Van Dyke and dark sienna, load it quite full of color"
Bob Ross,"Stay right there, now bring this up, now this thin color weve made, just pull one side through, see. So we have light, dark, light and dark. Now we can go right up in here"
Bob Ross,"I want some rocks and stones back here. All ya gotta do is touch, and that easy, in one stroke"
Bob Ross,"You can make the highlight and the shadow of numerous little stones and rocks, and theres a bigger one, see. You decide where they live, and just drop em in. That easy. Shoot, Ill tell ya what"
Bob Ross,This is just too good here. Its just a perfect place. Lets put a nice stone right there. And maybe another one right there. See that. Big ole stone lives there. Well give em a friend
Bob Ross,"Friend lives there. Maybe, sometime I get carried away with these rocks. Theyre so much fun to make, I just get to makin em and cant seem to quit. Well have a whole bunch of em right there"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets go back to our brush that has the it has liquid white on it, titanium white in it and a little touch of that phthalo blue, not much phthalo blue, just a little, and I bet you know whats"
Bob Ross,"coming. chuckles You know me. I love moving water, and its so much fun to make. Phew, yup, just a happy little waterfall right there, and it just works its way right around these stones"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Just splashes right outta there, and of course, right there, too"
Bob Ross,"And we push upward to make some splashy areas, some little foamy things that are happenin down here, cause we need those"
Bob Ross,Thats also a nice way of cutting off the bottom of your waterfall and making it as long or as short as you want it
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can just come back in here and put all kinds of little water movements, little things that are happening in the water"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little more of our little grass color here, come right down like that, brush tapping and maybe, shoot Ill tell ya what, take a little yellow ochre, little touch of the bright red,"
Bob Ross,"lets get a little crazy. Little bit crazy. You can use any color you want, and maybe, maybe, yeah, youre right, its just a little bush that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"He sorta hangs out over the water, right on the bank. Back into our greens, and just let somethin hang out right about there. So, it really looks like its protruding out over the water"
Bob Ross,"On the other side, maybe just bring this right on out. Just a little cove where the water goes, then it zings right on down the stream. There. Shoot, lets have some fun. Lets have some fun here"
Bob Ross,"Well take paint thinner, quite a bit of paint thinner and go right into my brown colors. There. You want a lot of color in this brush. Lets go up here. Lets get crazy"
Bob Ross,"chuckles Yeah, lets get crazy. In our world there lives a big ole tree, right about there"
Bob Ross,"Im doin it with a liner brush cause I wanna make it have a lotta bends and wiggles in it, but you could do it with a fan brush or whatever. It doesnt matter. Lets give him a little friend"
Bob Ross,"Everybody in my world has to have a friend. There. About like so, and maybe even, lets go on the other side. We dont want it left out. Maybe theres a little one that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"Tell ya what, you can also take a brush and pull it through that thin color that we made for rocks, and just go right down like that, see, and itll create the illusion of a beautiful highlight on"
Bob Ross,"these trees. That easy. That easy. Little bit more on the color, we can go along in here, and we just need to put some arms on this tree. We dont want it left out"
Bob Ross,"Wherever, maybe right up through there. This big ole rascal, it needs somethin on him. Just let your imagination go here. Just let it go. There"
Bob Ross,"I did a painting very similar to this for our newsletter a while back, and it was one of the best paintings I think weve ever done"
Bob Ross,"We had so many comments about it, and people painted it at home, and it worked for em. Its unreal. We have art contests every year, and I know that ones comin this year"
Bob Ross,"People will send that one in, cause they were happy with it. There. And wherever, wherever. You can put as many little limbs out here as you want. Now then, lets go back, get our ole 2-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Well go back into that same yellow-green color, and just tap a little more color, the same way we did to make the little grassy areas and the bigger trees. Im gonna put a few leaves up here"
Bob Ross,"I dont want too many because I dont wanna lose this background, but just a few nice little floaters that just sorta hang around up in here, wherever you want em. There"
Bob Ross,"Once again, I dont want too many up here, cause Id like to be able to see through this, and see that background that we worked so hard to put in. There, somethin like so"
Bob Ross,"Maybe on the other side here, maybe well change the flavor. Im gonna add a little bit more of the yellow ochre and Indian yella to that side. Yeah, thats nice. I like that"
Bob Ross,Just a little more to the gold tone. Its a very colorful little painting
Bob Ross,"As I mentioned early in this show, this is a painting if you hang it in a room, it will certainly brighten your room, and everybody will love it"
Bob Ross,"These black canvases are so phenomenal because every time you change the light, it looks like a new painting. Lets add a little bright red to yellow ochre and go out here and do this ole big one"
Bob Ross,"There, just really brighten him up. There we go. Just a little leaves that hang out here, have a good time, somethin like that. Sorta look at form and shape on your tree. Thats so important"
Bob Ross,Maybe this ole limb down heres got a few. Like there. There. We can take the liner brush
Bob Ross,"A little touch of the light color, and here and there and there and here maybe put the indication of just a few little sticks and twigs and things like that. I think this ones about done"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little paint thinner, a little bit of the bright red, and well sign this one. Certainly hope youve enjoyed this one because if you try this, guarantee youll love it"
Bob Ross,"Send us some photos. Wed love to see what youre doing. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. light jazz music"
Bob Ross,- Hey welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Its a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever you are. Tell you what lets get right on it today
Bob Ross,Lets start out and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that let me tell you what Ive got done up here already
Bob Ross,I thought today wed do the little opening that you see. The painting that the little painter man is wiping off with a big brush and I want to show you how that one was made
Bob Ross,"It was laying around the studio here and Ive just put one square here and one square there of just masking tape, thats all it is and Ive covered the whole canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid"
Bob Ross,"Very, very small amount on the two inch brush and this wont be an exact duplicate of what you see on the opening but its close enough youll see exactly how it was made and then you can do your own"
Bob Ross,"About like that, thats all were looking for and this is just plain yellow ochre, but its blending with the liquid white thats already on the canvas and all these fantastic hues happen"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, Im gonna grab another brush, I have several of them so I dont have to spend all my time washing brushes and go right into a small amount of the midnight black, dont need much, just a"
Bob Ross,"little, just a little. Lets go back up here now. Now over here well just take that black and well just begin on the other side of the sky"
Bob Ross,Now once again this also is gonna mix with the liquid white and the black of course is gonna become grey
Bob Ross,So we have a grey sky with a little bit of yellow in it and thats all thats in that sky that you see in the opening. I like that opening that little painter man is so cute
Bob Ross,"That was the idea of a special friend that works here at the station, Jerry Morton. He put that thing together for us. Hes very talented and I thank him for doing that. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, just blend these together so you cant tell where one color stops and the next color starts"
Bob Ross,"Thats all were looking for and then very lightly, very lightly go across the entire canvas and that just removes the brush strokes. Maybe blend a little more right there. Okay great"
Bob Ross,"Something like so. Now then, okay. Let me wash the old brush here and as you know we wash our brushes with odorless thinner. Shake of the excess. Hm, just beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,Oh Ive got to show you something here. I have to show you this. A gentleman made this for me
Bob Ross,"This is a cane that he carved and it is unreal, but hes actually put an image of old Bob on the end of it here and this was done by Mike Weaver"
Bob Ross,"Hes one of our certified instructors in Missouri but as you can see hes talented in many ways but thats really fantastic cane, isnt it. I think hes trying to tell me something. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Lets keep going here. Well take a little of the black. Put a little mountain in here, little black, little touch of, little touch of phthalo blue in there. Maybe even a little alizarin crimson"
Bob Ross,"Pull it out very flat, cut across, get our little roll of paint. Now these little squares were going to play some games here with different planes"
Bob Ross,"So Im going to have a mountain that projects above this right here and comes down. Something like so, but Im going to stop it right here at this piece of tape"
Bob Ross,"There, well let that come right on down like so, heres another peak right here. Just wherever you think a little peak should live. Thats exactly where it should be"
Bob Ross,Right on down and well stop it right there at that piece of tape. Okay a little color right under there
Bob Ross,"Now we can take a clean dry two inch brush, and just grab that and pull it just like we normally do to make a mountain. There, but I want to be careful not to let that color go past the tape. There"
Bob Ross,If you like this painting you can certainly do it without the tape and its still a beautiful painting. Or you could make your own designs. These designs are very interesting and people like them
Bob Ross,"Try them. Its very simple, you can do it with tape or contact paper. Just any old thing thatll stick to the canvas. Mm-hmm. Now lets just take some titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Well pull it out very flat, cut across, get our little roll of paint again. Always have that little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"Now we can go up in here and just start laying on some highlights right on this mountain. Barely, barely touching. Barely touching. Just graze the canvas"
Bob Ross,"As Ive mentioned before, when I was teaching my son Steve to paint, I used to tell him just to pretend that he was a whisperer just floating right across the mountain. Its that light"
Bob Ross,Its that delicate of a touch. You oughta see what kind of mountains hes painting today. Well you might of saw him on some of the previous shows. Does some fantastic mountains
Bob Ross,"He does better mountains than I do. Dont tell him I said that. Lets take little white, a little bit of phthalo blue. Mix together. and we use that for shadow color. Okay, I just take little edge"
Bob Ross,Let him go up in here and maybe Ill just sort of pull downward a little bit. Make the indication of some little ridges back here. Sometimes its fun to play little games in your mountains
Bob Ross,Then we can come back here. Just let all these little things happen. Little touch up in here. Just so we can see a little. Now we know theres tape there. Nothings gonna show so we dont care
Bob Ross,Well just bring that right across. There and wherever we need a shadow then we can just lay it in. Little touch right in there. Well push that little rascal right back. That easy. That easy
Bob Ross,On this canvas you have unlimited power. Can do anything here. You can change your world. Anything. Little white we just play some games back and forth. Let that just sort of float in there. Wherever
Bob Ross,"Now we take a clean beating brush and very dry two inch brush. Thats what all that beating was I was just making sure it was dry, and then very gently lift upward"
Bob Ross,Thatll help create that illusion of mist down at the base of the mountain. Over here. This direction and lift upward. Sometimes you can grab just a little bit of that and pull it
Bob Ross,Looks like a little light has spilled over. Its quite pretty. There. brushing Okay. Now then were ready to start putting some little footie hills in
Bob Ross,"So for that, take well just use that same old mountain color. Same old mountain color with a little be right back. A little bit of white in it. Just wanna lighten it up, but its the same basic color"
Bob Ross,"There. Lets go ahead up here. Very simple little foothill. We just have it come right on down, down, down, down. Maybe, maybe right along there. All were doing is tapping with a corner"
Bob Ross,"Now but watch, come back over this way. Watch right here. See Im gonna let this go into this plane. Notice the mountain stops here, but this one is gonna come through this plane and on over"
Bob Ross,This about as close to an abstract painting as Ive ever done on television. Course Ive made some mistakes at home and we call those abstracts but this is the first one weve done intentionally
Bob Ross,"I normally dont do paintings that I have to explain. There. Okay, now lets have a little water down here while we have this color on here. We can just come right in here"
Bob Ross,"Put in the indication of a little bit of water floating around. Something like so. brushing There, and this is just basic old mountain color"
Bob Ross,"brushing Okay, a little bit on the other side over here. Im gonna keep right in here. Im gonna keep it inside of this border. brushing There, and maybe down here well let it slip out"
Bob Ross,"Something like that, but just play games with different planes in your painting and youll be surprised at what you can create. You will absolutely be amazed. Now then, same color"
Bob Ross,"Well pull a little of that straight down. Straight down, and thatll end up being our reflections under that little foothill back there. Gently across, that easy"
Bob Ross,"Instant reflections, thats sneaky isnt it. There, a little bit of the liquid white. Pull it out as flat as you can get it and then take a knife and just cut across. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Then go up here and act just like youre trying to cut a hole right through the canvas and this old canvas is tough, youre not gonna hurt it. Not gonna hurt it, I dont think"
Bob Ross,"If you get out the butcher knife in your kitchen you certainly can, but this knife is dull, youre not gonna hurt it and right on over into here too. We want it to be all the way over. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now gonna mix up a little more color here. Well use black. Some phthalo blue, maybe Ill put a little Prussian blue in there too. Im gonna begin darkening this blue down"
Bob Ross,"Put a little alizarin crimson in there. Something like so. Least little touch of sap green. Alright. Okay let me wipe the old knife. Now then, shoot lets get crazy"
Bob Ross,Im gonna use the one inch brush today. Fan brush should work just as well but since I have it lets use it and lets go in here. Now this one stopped at that plane
Bob Ross,"Lets have this group of little distant trees. Theyre bigger, closer to us. I remember they come right down something like so and well have these work their way. Whew, there they go"
Bob Ross,"So now each plane in the painting, each layer of the painting has stopped at a different point within this tape and thats one of the things that make this painting so interesting when people look at"
Bob Ross,"it and I guarantee if you paint this one, people will look at it. There, pull that down a little. Now I wanna create mist right at the base. All you have to do is just tap"
Bob Ross,"Tap it, tap it, tap it all the way across and lift upward. Upward, upward and thatll create the illusion of mist. Now then, lets take, Im gonna add to that same color we just had, some brown"
Bob Ross,Little bit of brown. Little bit more of the black. So its a very dark color. Okay tap a little of that in there. Now I wanna have some land areas here
Bob Ross,I think the one that you see in that opening has land areas that come right out like that. So we put some dark in only so our light will show. You have to have dark in order to show light
Bob Ross,"Its just like in life. If you dont have a little sadness in your life, you dont know when the happy times come. There"
Bob Ross,"You know, while Im doing this, this is very repetitious, Im just gonna be putting in some dark areas. I wanna share a piece of video with you from a young friend that is just unreal"
Bob Ross,I had the pleasure of having dinner one night with Earl and his mother when I was there and theyre some of the loveliest people Ive ever met in my whole life and this painting introduces you to so
Bob Ross,"many new friends and Earl and his mother are just two of many people that Ive had the opportunity to meet. Just through painting. There. brushing Okay, but isnt that little rascal good"
Bob Ross,I mean he can paint. beating brush All Im doing is just making some reflections in here while youre doing that
Bob Ross,Look at that finished painting and if I remember I think Earl was nine years old now going on 40. laughs Isnt he something. I am so proud of that young man
Bob Ross,All Ive done is just tap in a little dark color here. Trying to remember basically where we had things. Maybe that came down about like that
Bob Ross,"Somewhere in there, but notice as were doing this, were putting the reflections with each layer because if I didnt pull this down, before I did this part it would mess up that of course"
Bob Ross,"So each layer, pull your reflections down just like so. Before you do the next layer and that way itll work so much easier. There, now we can come back. Put in all kinds of little things in here"
Bob Ross,"We can go right into a little of the cad yellow, yellow ochre, Indian yellow and then Ill hit a little touch of the bright red, but mix the color on the brush so you have a multitude of colors"
Bob Ross,"happening right there on your brush. Okay lets go back up here. Now, well put some nice green highlights right out here on this little peninsula that juts out into the water. Just tap. Tap, tap"
Bob Ross,"Now then, watch. Lets play some games. Sometimes its fun, let me find, well use a number three fan brush today. Let me pile my color up"
Bob Ross,If your color gets too flat on the palate you have to sort of pile it up so you can load a brush
Bob Ross,"Okay lets, go right in here and make it look like theres some trees that just go right out like that but you have to put that grassy area back in here first then put your trees and then come back"
Bob Ross,and put your next layer. So that it looks like theres layers and thats whatll make your painting stand out and be special
Bob Ross,"Alright, now then, back to our big brush, with all the little grassy things on it. We can come right back in here. See there. And begin laying in all kinds of little areas. There"
Bob Ross,"You can make this just as soft as a meadow. Okay. Now then lets have some fun. Gotta mix up some more color. Lets use some Prussian blue, some black, alizarin crimson, sap green. Sounds good"
Bob Ross,"Might as well mix up a pretty good pile of paint. Were gonna use it before this ones finished. Get a big fan brush, its time we get, got strong here. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,Just fill the brush up full of color. Lot of color. Now then we have to make some big decisions here. I think right there. Right here
Bob Ross,"We will have a nice evergreen tree and Im intentionally letting this go right over the tape. So when we pull the tape off, youll only see part of the tree. Maybe well give him a friend"
Bob Ross,"As Annette and I have traveled around the country teaching people, we have made so many fantastic friends that have been with us for so long now and that might truly be the joy of painting is the"
Bob Ross,"friends that you make doing it. Im gonna take, Im gonna tell you what. I was about to leave this trunk out. Poor little thing would fall over from weakness"
Bob Ross,"Take a little dark sienna and white, little roll of paint, and our little evergreen tree here. Lets just put least little indication of a tree trunk. There"
Bob Ross,"Now then, I have dark green, the little brush, doesnt matter which brush you use I just happened to pick it up. Put a few little highlights on this rascal here. There. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then lets take some van dyke brown on the old knife and lets go right in here, put some banks underneath this grass. Just some little banks, wherever"
Bob Ross,Maybe theres a lot of dirt showing right there. There and wherever
Bob Ross,"We can go ahead and put some down in here too, cause we know its going to end up being there and here and there maybe theres gonna be some dirt up in here wherever. Doesnt much matter"
Bob Ross,"Little touch of brown and white and we can just tip that a little. Just to make it look like rocks and dirt. There. All kinds of little things are happening. There they are. There, okay"
Bob Ross,Now Im gonna take my fan brush that has the green on it and go back in here and pop in a little bush here and there. Just enough to sort of break up that edge and bring all that together
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres some nice bushes right here in front of those little trees. Take the knife, scrape in few little sticks and twigs and sometimes I scratch down, sometime I scratch up"
Bob Ross,Just depends on what kind of mood Im in. laughs That youll find by touching it and pulling up youll get a sharper point on the end. There if that makes sense. Lets go well use a one inch brush
Bob Ross,"Maybe we have a big bush if I remember correctly, it lives right about here. So we just throw some dark in so our light will show. Push upward with a one inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Create all those little, little leafy feelings. Im gonna take another one inch brush, dip it in liquid white. Im gonna go through the cad yellow, be right back here, a little sap green"
Bob Ross,"Pull the brush in one direction. Loading it fully. Lot of paint. Look at all the paint. Lot of paint on that brush. Lets go up here. Now, gently push upward"
Bob Ross,"Just gently, gently, and turn the brush to form all these individual little limbs and branches. Dont just push them all in one direction. Itll look like youre lazy. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay we can change the flavor just a little bit with some yellow ochre, little Indian yellow. Put another little thing right in there. Just wherever, wherever"
Bob Ross,"Go back to the old two inch brush that had all the greens on it and maybe tap in just an indication, some little grassy areas back in there. Come right down here. Somewhere in like in there"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you want and once again, this is not an exact duplicate of what you see at the beginning of the show, but it will show you exactly the way it was made and it may turn out better than the one"
Bob Ross,"that you see at the beginning of the show. Who knows. Okay we can take a little paint thinner, a little brown. Make it thin like ink and we had, lets see here"
Bob Ross,"We right here, well have a nice little tree that lives right up there. There he goes. In fact there was two of them"
Bob Ross,Other one goes right on over there somewhere and then we can put all kinds of little limbs and sticks and twigs and whatever you want on here. There we go
Bob Ross,Thats nice when you have a lot of time and you can just sit and put all kinds of little branches and sticks on here. Thats so pretty. There. Little bit more of the thinner
Bob Ross,"Make that one a little fatter, cause hes the big guy. Give this one a little more body and were in business. There we go. Now then, lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Think its time to take the tape off and see what we have here. Alright, grab the old tape. tape peeling And just pull it right off there. Okay and now well come back, lets get this second one"
Bob Ross,"tape peeling Pull it right off, and isnt that neat. Already we have all that stuff there done. Okay. There we go. Tape gets stuck on everything. Now then, now we can have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Now I like taking the liner brush. Once again make that paint very thin and lets go back over and I wanna pull one of these trees through this line. It just, just sort of makes it interesting"
Bob Ross,Everybody will be interested in this. When you do it this way. Its so different
Bob Ross,"There, and then, now this one, I dont wanna come through this one, but over here Im gonna bring it through if that makes any sense at all. So it looks like it looks like this one is behind that line"
Bob Ross,"There. Alright. Now then. You know me and my big trees here. Lets take, lets take the old fan brush. Fill it up full of that dark, dark color and go right up here"
Bob Ross,"I think there was a large tree that lived, boy he does now. Right there, and just start, corner of the brush, working back and forth, back and forth. There"
Bob Ross,Now the one that we show at the opening has a naked spot right there. laughs He didnt grow ant fir right there. Thats why they call them fir trees. Okay
Bob Ross,"Right on down, letting go and all were doing is putting in some background color right now. Now then he had a friend, lived right there. There we go"
Bob Ross,"See, and Im gonna let him project right out clean over where the tape was. So thatll push everything back. This whole painting is a game of planes. Its a lot of fun. Lot of fun, youll enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"Tap in little bit of dark stuff here. We can go back, put the least little touch of highlight on this big old tree. Little green and yellow, thats all were using. Something like that"
Bob Ross,"Take our one inch brush, dip it in the liquid white, go through our yellows, greens, and lets just make a happy little bush or two down here and we got it. There"
Bob Ross,"See, little touch of the yellow ochre here and there just to break it up. There we are. But isnt that a fantastic little painting"
Bob Ross,"Guarantee if you do this one, it will certainly get peoples attention. They will love it and I think with that were going to call this one finished"
Bob Ross,"From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless my friend. upbeat music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today wed just do a fantastic little painting that I think youll enjoy"
Bob Ross,"So lets start out and have run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got done up here already"
Bob Ross,"We have our standard old pre-stretched canvas up here. And as you can plainly see Ive covered the bottom of it with a little bit of black gesso. A little bit, about so-high. Not quite half"
Bob Ross,"You dont want to divide it totally. The black gesso, then I put a little bit of liquid clear on it"
Bob Ross,"Then on top of that Ive just put a mixture of midnight black and a little sap green in it, just sort of a real gray color with a little green in it"
Bob Ross,"And the top is just covered with liquid white like normal, and its all wet. Dont let it dry before you start"
Bob Ross,"Now the black gesso had dried before we put the transparent paint on, but everythings wet now. So lets just keep playin with those same colors. Well use black, and a little bit of sap green"
Bob Ross,"Be right back, have to sneak up here and get the green. And just load a little color right into the bristles. Now there, today lets just do a fun, little painting, and just enjoy"
Bob Ross,"Im just going to take the brush and just make a little circles. Little, circular patterns all over. Let it go. Just wherever you want it"
Bob Ross,"This is really a nice way of just taking out your frustrations. If youre having a bad day, this is a nice painting to do, cause itll make you feel good. You can just work out all your hostilities"
Bob Ross,"There. A little more color. Its just black, sap green once again. Not a great deal of green, though. Mostly black"
Bob Ross,Want it to be just sort of a greenish-gray color when it mixes with the liquid white thats on the canvas. There. Just every kind of little pattern
Bob Ross,"Just try to mix it up and make it look different all over. Like that. Here and there. And you begin seeing things in there, just by doing this"
Bob Ross,"I think Ill make a scene that has a lot of trees far away, like youre looking deep into the woods. And so we just need some background cover there"
Bob Ross,"Im going to add a little van dyke brown, a little dark sienna to the brush. And here and there. Not everywhere, but just here and there. And add a little bit of that"
Bob Ross,"Maybe even a touch of, little bit of alizarin crimson here and there. Not much, though, just a little. Just to change the flavor so its not all exactly the same. There"
Bob Ross,"A little more of the black, maybe a little more dark sienna mixed with it. Come right in here and drop in some little, just a little circular patterns"
Bob Ross,"Alright, I bet your sayin, Well, Ive really done it this time. Thats a total mess youve got started already.  You may be right. Hope not. There. But notice how everything is going on"
Bob Ross,"Theres light spots up in here, and theres spots right beside it that are very dark. And that way you have a variety of patterns going"
Bob Ross,"So when we begin putting all of our little trees and stuff in the foreground it will give the feeling of being deep, deep back in the woods. Now, pick our liner brush. Well go right into some of that"
Bob Ross,Im just goin to use that black and sap green. Thats fine. Doesnt matter. Get the paint very thin with paint thinner. And lets go up in here. And maybe in these light spots
Bob Ross,"here and there, well begin putting the indication of all kinds of little tree limbs and branches and twigs. And it doesnt matter if you cant see all of them"
Bob Ross,You cant see where it starts or where it stops. Cause theyre goin be looking between a lot of foliage. And most of these will probably end up being covered up. But some of them will show through
Bob Ross,And people will think youve literally worked for days putting all these little things in here. Shhh. We dont tell them any different. There we are. Just a few. Just a few
Bob Ross,You dont have to get too carried away with em. There we go. Thats enough to get us started. We can add some more later if we want to. Well just use that same ol dirty brush. What the heck
Bob Ross,Its workin pretty good. No use messin with it if its workin. Im going to go right into the yellow. Be right back here. Grab a little bit of sap green. So we have yellow and sap green
Bob Ross,"A little yellow ochre. Indian yellow. Once in awhile a little touch of the bright red. And the bright red is really in there to dull the green. Alright, now then. Lets begin picking out little things"
Bob Ross,"Now if you sort of look at your painting, and each one will be different, you can begin picking out little shapes and forms, and things happening. Use just the corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,"And just start picking out individuals. Just begin picking out individuals. Wherever you think they should be. There we go. Ok, change the flavor a little"
Bob Ross,"Add a little more of the yellow ochre maybe to this one. So it looks like theres a different bush right there. But see, it covers up the base of that one"
Bob Ross,Now we dont want to kill all this background because all those little patterns that you put in there by themselves nearly look like all kinds of little things
Bob Ross,"Add a little more of the greens and the yellows, and all the colors here. And just sort of let these things happen. But once again, everybodys painting will be totally different. Totally unique"
Bob Ross,"So dont just try to copy. When youre doing yours, look at what happens. Take advantage of what happens. And did you know, if youve painted with us before, we do not make mistakes"
Bob Ross,We have a happy accident every once in awhile. But we dont make mistakes. Because we learn to work with anything that happens on this piece of canvas. Youre truly the master of your world here
Bob Ross,There we go. But is that beginning to give you the feeling of being deep in the woods. I hope so. There. We just layer after layer after layer. There we go
Bob Ross,"And these layers, work on one layer at a time, and keep coming forward. Thats whatll create the illusion of distance in your painting"
Bob Ross,"I know I say that so much, but to me, it is very, very important in a painting to have depth and distance in it. There. Now then, maybe well go back up here"
Bob Ross,"We need some little things over here on the other side, too. We dont it totally left out. There. Just sort of let em overlap. Maybe they just come together right there. We dont know"
Bob Ross,All kinds of things happen in the woods. It used to be a fantastic place for my little squirrel to live. I gotta show you another picture of that little rascal
Bob Ross,"If youve been with us during this series, Ive showed you two or three times our little squirrel that we call Peapod, the pocket squirrel. And hes one of the most precious, little creatures"
Bob Ross,"And while Im doing this, well just put him up here. Now after he eats, hi little rascal, hell sleep anywhere. He is the laziest little devil. Watch him go"
Bob Ross,"He just climbs up sometimes, I have an old towel here, and he just climbed up in it, and sort of made himself at home, and kicked back"
Bob Ross,"Oh, tummys full and its a nice, warm day, and off to sleep well go. But isnt he cute. And after he goes to sleep, you can literally just pick him up. Look at that"
Bob Ross,"Looks like hes at the beach, doesnt he. Kicked back there and gettin a few rays. But thats how lazy that little rascal is after he gets his tummy filled"
Bob Ross,"I think hes just one of the most precious, little creatures Ive ever had. Did I say his name was Peapod. And he wants to live in your pocket"
Bob Ross,"laughs Hes probably, oh hes probably five weeks old now maybe. Itll be another couple of months before we can turn him loose and then, off hell go and hell have his own family. There"
Bob Ross,"And hopefully hell stay around my backyard when I turn him loose and still visit with me. But if he doesnt, I know hes happy, and hes doing what squirrels should do. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe right in here. While you were watching the squirrel, all weve done is just continue to add some little bushes and tree things here and there. There we go"
Bob Ross,"But isnt that a neat way of doing a background that looks like theres just layer after layer of woods and forest, and all kinds of things"
Bob Ross,"Years ago when I was a traditional painter, I mightve worked for two or three weeks to produce an effect like this. And chances are, I wouldve worked it to death and it wouldve been very muddy"
Bob Ross,"And by muddy, I mean you just work your color so much they just sort of all turn gray and brown. Get dirty lookin. I had a lot of problems with that when I was a traditional painter"
Bob Ross,"But this is so fast and so fresh, that you dont have time for it to get muddy. Now, as I mentioned earlier, we can take our black with a little green in it, and go back here and there"
Bob Ross,And we can add in a couple more little sticks and twigs. And you can sort of look at little patterns that happened here. And where you think there should be some little things to hold all these up
Bob Ross,"There. Just wherever you want em. We dont want too many. Dont want too many. Maybe even right in here. Once again, every painting is gonna be different, and thats what makes it great"
Bob Ross,"But look at yours and see where you think a little stick should live. A little twig or whatever you need to hold up all your branches on your trees. I think today, its such a good day"
Bob Ross,Lets get crazy. Lets get crazy. Maybe laughs here we go. Maybe theres a big cliff here. A big drop-off. A big gulley
Bob Ross,"So Im gonna put a little, I know you cant see this, but its just straight van dyke brown. And Im putting that there cause I want to have a nice embankment right there"
Bob Ross,Nice cliff or drop-off or gorge. Whatever you want to call it. I know its going to be there
Bob Ross,"And to that, lets say Im havin one of those days when youre just feeling sort of flaky and you just do nice things and have fun with painting"
Bob Ross,"A little dark sienna, a little van dyke brown, a little white. Dont over mix it. Its most important for it to stay marbled like that. And you cut off that little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"All those different mixtures are right there in that roll. You can even see em in there. See, theres white on the bottom, right there. And then down here, theres a nice brown color"
Bob Ross,"So it gives you all those little things happening. Now I want to show, this is why I put the brown there. Barely touch. Just graze it. This is just like you were laying snow on the mountain"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Just putting a few little things. Something like that. Probably makes no sense at all yet, but I have something in mind, I think"
Bob Ross,"Alright, lets go back, well go back to the old brush here that had the greens and stuff on it. Greens, yellow, yellow ochre, Indian yellow. A touch of bright red once in awhile"
Bob Ross,But see how were loading that brush. Its actually being pushed. Do it real slow so you can see. Its being pushed. And right there on the tip you can see that little ridge of paint
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go up here. Now with that little ridge of paint, I want to make some little grassy areas back here. But thats actually all youre painting with. See it"
Bob Ross,"And now well have some little grassy areas, and they come right up here. And this is a very sharp drop-off in my mind. So maybe theres some nice things that just literally hang over the edges"
Bob Ross,And that easy. That easy you can make these. I like doing banks like this where you have all these little grassy things that hang over the edge. There. Those are fun to me
Bob Ross,"And people love these kind of little paintings. Its just like gesso, to me, is one of the neatest things that has ever been invented. I dont know why somebody didnt do before I did"
Bob Ross,"Now everybodys doing it. There. But isnt that neat. Maybe back here well have that one hang over, too. I just like seeing them weeds hanging over that"
Bob Ross,"Look what a beautiful effect it creates right in there. My gosh, you could slip off from there and be there forever and ever. Nobodyd ever find you down in that big thing. There we go. Tell you what"
Bob Ross,"If Im gonna fall off in there, I want to land on something soft. Ill find a fan brush, dip it in liquid white. Into the titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Gonna give a touch, be right back with phthalo blue right in there. So we have liquid white to thin the paint, titanium white and a little touch of phthalo blue. And maybe, here we go. Right here"
Bob Ross,"I see it. Theres a little waterfall. Lives right in there. That easy. And you can do that basically, go over and down, over and down. Its most important you have a flat edge up here"
Bob Ross,"Ill do it again. I dont want him that big, so Ill just cut him off later. But thats how its done. And our waterfall, maybe it comes down here and hits a rock and does this"
Bob Ross,"Well put another rock in front here in a minute and itll all make sense. There. Now Im gonna put some splashes. Waterfalling that far, thered be some nice splashes goin on down here. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now, let me grab a two-inch brush, put a little touch of titanium white on it, and pull straight down. Just straight down. Something like that. And go across. See there. And instantly, we have water"
Bob Ross,"Thats one of the neatest, nicest things about this whole technique is water. Now then, we can just take the fan brush and come back in here"
Bob Ross,"And clean up the edges, put some little ripples across the water where its flowing out here. And whatever. Its all we need. Now, back to our old knife"
Bob Ross,"Take some van dyke brown, and in my mind theres gonna be, maybe theres a projection comes out here. And you make any kind of little projection you want. Maybe theres a bump there, comes right down"
Bob Ross,"See, put that there, and put a little highlight on it, and all of a sudden it will push that waterfall way back here. Watch what it does here. Least little touch of color, and just pull down"
Bob Ross,Barely touching the canvas. But itll have a tendency to push all that back. And we can bring this one right out in front of it. There
Bob Ross,"Now, back to our ol brush that has the yellows and the greens on it. We can come right back in here. Let me get a little more color. Come right back in here, and just let those things flow right over"
Bob Ross,"Now, if you have trouble making the colors stick, add the least little touch of paint thinner to your brush. But the least, least little bit"
Bob Ross,"And itll thin the paint, and itll flow right over the top of this thicker paint. Now then, over here on the other side, we have to have something to hold the other side in or it will get away"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right about here. Lets have a nice projection comes out. Tell you what, this comes right down, and all thats weed back. See how we can change your mind, just put things in there"
Bob Ross,"And in your world you can do this. Anything that you can imagine, you can have. At least on this piece of canvas. But at least on this piece of canvas, you can. I like that. That pushes all it back"
Bob Ross,"Put a little water splash around his foots. Right down here. Now heres a little trick. If you want to show water dripping down, lift it up. Now it looks like the water, see. Is dripping down"
Bob Ross,"Touch up, and the water comes down. I know that sounds crazy, but it works. Trust me. Betcha heard that the last time you went to buy a used car, didnt ya. laughs There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now take a little black, a little blue, little alizarin crimson. Just make a dark color on the ol two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"I wanna have a nice bush sitting out here on this, so I need some dark in here, just so when I put some light on it, itll show"
Bob Ross,"I wanna make that waterfall a little smaller, so all I do is just cut him down. See. You can cut the waterfall down to any size that you want him. Any size that you want him"
Bob Ross,"Alright, now then, lets put, ahh, lets make it a little brighter. Oh, thats better. See I just added a bit more of a cad yellow to it so it would stand out against the background"
Bob Ross,"Now, theres a lot of moisture if theres a waterfall here. And usually, where theres a lot of moisture, the plants seem to hang more"
Bob Ross,"They just get lazy because they dont have to work for water, I guess. Now, tell you what, maybe theres another big rock right here. Lets do this, maybe well just pull it right on out here"
Bob Ross,"This is just van dyke brown, little touch of dark sienna into it. Somethin like that, now. Back to our highlight cutter, brown and white"
Bob Ross,"Well just come right in here with the indication of a few, little highlights. Dont want to much or it will distract"
Bob Ross,"And then right over this edge, Im gonna take this small knife, so thats very dark. So it looks like theres a little overhang there. I hope you can see that"
Bob Ross,"Thats sort of a sneaky little way of making like an overhang where you can stand and watch this beautiful, little waterfall. And well have maybe just a little bush lives there"
Bob Ross,"Little bushes live everywhere in our world. Little things, just growin all out here. But when youre painting, make up little stories. Imagine that this place is real, at least in your mind"
Bob Ross,"And mentally, if you can see it, you can paint it. And people ask, cause we have almost 300 half hour shows on. People say, Where do you come up with all these ideas"
Bob Ross,"Well, a lot of them come from people sending photographs of things theyd like to see painted. We get hundreds of photographs, and I paint a lot of pictures from those photographs"
Bob Ross,"But a lot of them come from right here. I just sort of sit down and make up little stories. And it helps to be a little crazy, so that gives me sort of an advantage"
Bob Ross,"laughs But, in your world, just think about things, and mentally if you can see em, you can do em. So just a little practice. Ok, we said we was gonna get crazy"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, Id like to live right here, so Im gonna put me a house. Im gonna put me a house that lives right here. Maybe an ol rundown house out here. I want a big house today"
Bob Ross,"I draw little cabins all the time. Today, I want a big house. Since this is our world, we can do that. We can do that. Didnt you like that little squirrel. Wasnt he the wildest thing"
Bob Ross,"I like it when he just sort of lays around like that. I just think its so cute. There. Well, this is goin to be a big house. Great big house"
Bob Ross,And all were doing here is just basically blocking it in. All we wanna do is just come up with the basic shape for this ol house. There
Bob Ross,"Just van dyke brown, a little dark sienna here and there, but mostly van dyke brown. I have had a little sienna. There. Well, now we gotta make some big decisions here. Tell you what. Lets do"
Bob Ross,"I have the same highlight color I was usin down here, its just brown and white. Maybe well just put some the indication here of some old boards going this way"
Bob Ross,"We usually make em going the other way. But just touching and working your way across here. Give a little, tiny little pull-down. There. Just keep it goin, back and forth. There"
Bob Ross,"And vary the colors a little cause boards some of them are lighter in color than others, and some are darker, and some weather better. Now then, we take a clean, dry brush"
Bob Ross,"One here, and some air, and just gently, gently go across that. It makes a very nice old wood effect. That easy. Now, maybe this carpenter, maybe he had a toddy or two on the job. You know"
Bob Ross,"That happens sometimes. Boy, does it happen sometime. Lets take dark sienna, van dyke brown, and just a little white. See. Theres the old color we were using. Now heres the new color"
Bob Ross,See how much darker it is. This is gonna be on the shadow side. So well come right over here. Maybe these boards on this side of the building go this way. Who knows. This is our building
Bob Ross,"We can make any way we want it. Any way that we want it. And today, I think they outta go that way. What the heck. Back to our brushes. Dry. Touch that. Give it a little pull. Now, tell you what"
Bob Ross,"Lets really get crazy. Take some white and some black, mix it together, make a gray. Nice gray color. And use a little edge of the knife"
Bob Ross,"Start right here at the roof, and just begin pulling down and working the layers here. I want to create the illusion of some nice, little shingles. Just sort of gray shingles on this"
Bob Ross,"But thats gonna mix with that brown thats already on the canvas, and give you all kinds of little variations, which are very nice. Very nice. There. See. There they come. Just shingle after shingle"
Bob Ross,"Years ago I was a carpenter and Ill tell you this, its not that easy to put shingles on a roof"
Bob Ross,"And if youve ever watched Dana Jester, one of our teachers thats on the show frequently, hes one of our national staff of teachers. Hes a fantastic painter"
Bob Ross,"But if you ever watch him, for many years he, too, was a carpenter. So he can tell ya, it was not that easy to do. Take a little light color. This can be just light gray"
Bob Ross,"And well just sort of highlight these edges so they stand out a little. Now maybe, let me grab a small knife here. Maybe this is a two-story house. Lets get crazy. Put a window there. A window there"
Bob Ross,A window there. I told you I was gonna have a big house this time. Just scrape it out. Just use some black. Nobodys home today. You can put light in the window if you wanted to. A little light color
Bob Ross,"Just sort of outline these a little. Like that. Wherever you want. But, now we notice some windows. Maybe up here theres a little something for the attic. Thats probably where Id have to live"
Bob Ross,Now that weve got that black on there. Lets put the door over here. You put your door wherever you want it. But I thought today wed put it over here. Shoot. Tell you what
Bob Ross,"Lets put, I got a minute remaining here so, lets have a little shed, or I mean, not a shed. A little roof, a little porch. Stands right out here. I said shed"
Bob Ross,"You can make a shed the same way, but today were just gonna have a little porch to hold up everything and keep the rain off the guy that lives in here"
Bob Ross,"I guess we need a little post to hold the porch up or itll fall. There. Now then, we can take, we can take, put in a little grass right in here. Shoot, we about have a finished painting"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that a super little thing. Try this one. I believe youll like it. And if you have time, send us a photo of what youre doing. Every once in awhile we put em together and show em on TV"
Bob Ross,"Until then, happy painting. God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,"light lounge music - Voiceover This program is brought to you by North Light Books, publisher of over 200 how-to books and videos for fine artists and graphic designers"
Bob Ross,"And by Langnickel, manufacturers of selected artist brushes"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Were certainly glad you could join us today. Today Id thought wed just do a fantastic little painting that I hope youll enjoy"
Bob Ross,"So I tell you what, lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us"
Bob Ross,"And as usual, theyll come across in the same order as I have them on the palette starting with the white and working around. Theyll put em right about there"
Bob Ross,"laughs All right, come on up here let me show you what Ive gotten done already"
Bob Ross,"Today Ive taken and cut a little oval out of some contact paper, or any kind of adhesive backed paper, and just stuck it on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"Then weve covered the whole inside here with just a very thin, even coat of the Liquid White. So its all slick and wet and its ready to go. So lets just have a good time"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, today, todays such a wonderful day lets just take and make a happy little painting. Well use a little bit of Yellow Ochre"
Bob Ross,Well start with that and lets go up in here and lets just very quickly put in a very beautiful little sky thats very easy. Nothing to it. Just make little crisscross strokes like so
Bob Ross,"Something like that, I dont want a lotta color in this sky. I want this sky to sort of be, oh, nondescript. Just very, very quiet little sky. Maybe well get a little bit crazy"
Bob Ross,"You know me, I like a little bit of action. Im gonna take a little touch of Alizarin Crimson. Very, very small amount. Cant say that enough. I just wanna warm it up a little right about in there"
Bob Ross,"Just the smallest amount possible. There we go. Now then, lets go into, I didnt wash the brush yet, well go into Midnight Black. Just load a little of that on that ol two inch brush"
Bob Ross,Just tap the bristles right into a little bit of the color. And lets go up in here. Then maybe right in here well just put a little of that black color
Bob Ross,"As that gets with the Liquid White thats already on the canvas, we have a beautiful gray color. There. And maybe, maybe in our world. Now Im making little circles just using the corner of the brush"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres some little floater clouds thats gray that just sort of live right in here. Just little floaters, they just hang around here and have a good time all day"
Bob Ross,"Okay, I have several brushes going. So let me grab another one. Well take a clean brush now and we just wanna blend this right here. Just blend it and soften it"
Bob Ross,"So it just sort of just sits there very gently. Doesnt scream at you, it just sits there. But now your world, if you would like to make that more distinct or brighter please do"
Bob Ross,"Because, as you know, on this piece of canvas you can do anything that you wanna do. And thats what you should do, it should make you happy. Painting should make you happy"
Bob Ross,"All right, well, you know me I like water so while we got this little brush going Im gonna take a little touch of the Phthalo Blue and the least little touch of the Phthalo Green mixed into it"
Bob Ross,"Not much, that green is very, very strong. Just a little and maybe in our world therell be, maybe well have a little water down here somewhere. I dont really know at this point"
Bob Ross,"Then again, by the time we get down here we may change our mind and take the water out. We can do that, we can do that"
Bob Ross,"As Ive mentioned before, when you buy your first tube of paint you get an artist license and it says you can do anything that you wanna do on this piece of canvas. All right lets wash the brush"
Bob Ross,Thats the fun part of this. laughs We wash our brushes in odorless paint thinner. And be sure its odorless or youll be very unpopular. Shake it laughs and then just beat the devil out of it
Bob Ross,"Beat the bristles against any firm object. For home use, though, I really recommend that you look into a little brush beater rack that you can put in the bottom of a garbage can"
Bob Ross,"It will save your marriage. laughs Lets take a little black, maybe a little Prussian Blue. Very strong blue. Well just mix those together, cut off the least little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"Very small roll where it lives right on the edge of the knife. Now come right up in here and lets decide maybe today, lets really practice on a mountain"
Bob Ross,"I get so many requests for mountains, even though we do quite a few of them. People love mountains. It seems to be the most popular thing that I get requests for"
Bob Ross,"All right, maybe theres a big valley right down in here. I dont know, whatever, whatever. There we go. Now we have a valley there. We could have another little bump in there. Anything that you like"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Okay, something like that. Now then, lets take ol two inch brush. Well grab that and pull it"
Bob Ross,"Just those two things removes excess paint and it starts creating that illusion of mist down at the base of the mountain. That illusion of mist, thats what makes your mountains so beautiful"
Bob Ross,"It just looks like its floating in all that mist. There. After our removal of the excess paint, will make the next step much, much easier. Cause were gonna put some highlights in there"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Already it looks misty down at the base and thats exactly, exactly what were trying to do. And I wash the ol brush again"
Bob Ross,"paint brush bangs laughs If you havent figured out, I just like to wash the brush and watch the camera crews reaction when they dodge. All right laughs, lets take some white"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put the least little touch of, least little touch of some Dark Sienna in there. I just want a hint. Cut across, little roll of paint and lets go up in here. No pressure, no pressure at all"
Bob Ross,"And lets just begin forming our mountain. This is where you make all the little highlights, all the beautiful little things that happen in your mountain"
Bob Ross,"And you can have this mountain go anywhere that you want it to go. Anywhere. Just like so. That little touch of Dark Sienna in there is just enough, though, to make it very nice"
Bob Ross,Be careful not to overdo. Dont overdo. Sometimes these things get working nice and we get carried away and just cover up everything. All right
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe theres just a little touch, tell you what Im gonna do. Im gonna take some white and put a little, little touch of Phthalo Blue. Thats too much, dont want that much"
Bob Ross,"There, thats better. And a little bit of Van Dyke Brown in just to dull it down. Just to dull that color down some. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now then, take our little roll of paint, as usual, and we go right in here and just begin putting in some beautiful little shadow areas. Just like so. But think about forming shape here"
Bob Ross,"How do you want this thing to be. There. Okay, maybe right in here we need a little something. Not much, though, I want that to stay pretty dark in there. Thats a deep crevasse in there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, over in here. There, there it comes. Maybe this one just wraps right around and comes right in there. I dont know. See, it makes that mountain look like its sort of standing up"
Bob Ross,And well put a few little things over here. This is back with the white that has a little bit of Dark Sienna in it. And were just gonna sort of play these back and forth. However. There
Bob Ross,"Little hint up here, I dont want a lot back here. Its too far away. Keep him in the background somewhere. And well come right along in here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, shoot I dont know, maybe it comes right on out there. Wherever you want it. This is an excellent exercise in painting mountains"
Bob Ross,"Itll really make you feel comfortable with mountains if youll devote a little time to a painting like this. Cause by the time you do this one, mountains will never give you any more problems. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe, maybe. Oh well do a little right in there, too, what the heck. Not a lot in there. Go back to our white, its got a little brown in it. There. Come right back in here"
Bob Ross,"Now, you may find the little knife works much better for getting into some of these areas that are small like this. Just sort of an individual thing. There we go"
Bob Ross,Just let those little things just play and think about shape and form and how you want this to be
Bob Ross,"Now with a clean paint brush bangs, dry two inch brush Im gonna blend a lot of this together just by tapping being very careful to follow the angles that weve put in this mountain"
Bob Ross,"Even in here, I want to take the brush and very lightly, dont want to destroy I just want to blend it together. See how gentle that is. Thats a half a hair and some air"
Bob Ross,That gives you an idea of how gentle. Just barely graze the top. You can soften all of that. Thats why I wadnt too worried when I put it on. Okay and then over here. But idnt it just absolutely fun
Bob Ross,"Thats a pretty mean lookin ol mountain. paint brush bangs All right, now we have us a little mountain. Maybe in our world, we have some great big foothills that live back here"
Bob Ross,"So lets take, well use some black, oh a little touch of the Prussian Blue. Im gonna reach up here and get a little Sap Green. Maybe even a little brown and crimson in there"
Bob Ross,"Well just put everything in there. Then a little white cause I wanna value this down to where its color about like that. And sort of a, sort of a greenish gray color"
Bob Ross,"Today, lets have some fun with the old oval brush. Its easy to tell cause its the only brush we have that has a black handle. And I made that one black so itd be easy to identify"
Bob Ross,"But as you can see, the end of its sort of round. Its like a huge filbert brush only its like one of our one inch brushes. Now then"
Bob Ross,"I like this brush because it makes it makes beautiful little roundy hill type things just by tapping down. There. Just think about the shape that you want, put it in there. Drop it in there"
Bob Ross,Theres not a great deal of paint on here. It might look like theres a lot of paint but theres really not a lot of paint. Just enough to stain the canvas. There. Idnt that fantastic
Bob Ross,"I knew you could do it. Maybe this one goes all the way up here. I dont know, wherever you want it. There. Okay. Sometimes I get carried away and just let these things cover up half the canvas"
Bob Ross,"When you do yours be a little more careful than I am. Sometimes, I was gonna say sometimes I let it get out of hand here cause its fun"
Bob Ross,"And even though Ive probably painted, oh I dont, I dont even know how many paintings, 20, 30,000 paintings now, maybe more. I still get a fantastic charge out of just watching it happen"
Bob Ross,"Still amazes me, its still fun. I dont think painting is one of those things that you ever get tired of, or ever gets old to ya"
Bob Ross,"Now then, Im gonna take my ol two inch brush and just pull some of that down. Thatll give us a little reflection already. Something like that"
Bob Ross,"And by making this higher than these sides it gives the impression that that lake goes back. I guess thats a lake back there. Makes it look like it goes back, it has distance. Then well go across"
Bob Ross,"Instant reflections. That easy. All right. I have several of these little oval brushes so Im gonna grab another one and put a little Liquid White on it. Go into some yellow, just Cad Yellow"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna reach up here and be right back and get the least little touch of the Phthalo Green. Its a very bright green, be careful with it. Ooo, itll eat up your whole world in a heartbeat"
Bob Ross,"Put a little Yellow Ochre in there to dull it down a little. Now, just tap the brush. There you are and well go up here. Now we have to start picking out little individual hills back in here"
Bob Ross,"Just go right in here with that oval brush. Itll make em almost automatically. Just tap, gently, gently tap. I want it to get darker, darker, darker, darker, darker"
Bob Ross,"So do the tops while the bush is fresh. While you have good clean color on there, do the tops first and then work your way down"
Bob Ross,"That way automatically it will pick up the dark color underneath and get duller and duller. Thats what we want, we want it to get darker and darker, darker as it works down"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now, maybe theres another one that lives right here. See, by changing the flavor of the color a little bit we can literally break em apart. Make it like theres several layers here"
Bob Ross,"There we go and we just pick out little individual things. Take it wherever you want it. Every time you want it to stand up, put a little lighter color in there maybe"
Bob Ross,"Like that and then it jumps right out at you. And then get darker, darker, darker down toward the base again. Thats most important"
Bob Ross,"If it doesnt get darker, then you cant put a lighter color against it and make it show up. See, watch I take a little lighter color and that easy we can put another one in there. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, over here on the other side lets do the same thing right in here. Dont want this side left out. He wants some little highlights, too, but back in here Im just going to fade into nothing"
Bob Ross,"Think in my world I might put some trees over there. Gotta have some somewhere, I like trees. There. Okay. All kinds of little doers. Maybe this one comes on out here somewhere"
Bob Ross,"But look at all the layers in there. Just tiny little foothills. All right. Okay, little bit of the Liquid White right on the tips of the brush there"
Bob Ross,Just want to highlight like theres some light just really zinging right through. Just hitting a few things
Bob Ross,"Just a tiny bit of Liquid White right on the tips of the bristles but dont overdo or itll lose its effectiveness. Just a few, just a few. Now then, maybe chuckles, you know me. Lets get crazy"
Bob Ross,Lets take a little Liquid White and maybe right up in here in our world there lives a tiny little waterfall. breath puffs out I love waterfalls so lets just put a little one back in here
Bob Ross,Way back in the distance somewhere. Then well just let that just sort of come out from there
Bob Ross,"Well just take liner brush and we put a little paint thinner with it to thin it down a little more so itll slide over the top. There, see, if it doesnt slide add a little paint thinner"
Bob Ross,Thats all you gotta do. Idnt that easy. That easy we have a little waterfall that lives back there. Just has a super time into that mountain
Bob Ross,"Maybe thats snow melting off the mountain, flowing down here in our little lake, pond, whatever it is. Body of water. There we go. All right, thats basically about all we need in that water"
Bob Ross,"All right. Lets take, let me clean off a spot. Even with a palette this big I run out of room sometime. Thats a messy painter"
Bob Ross,"You know, I got a letter the other day from a lady who wanted to know if she had to put out this much paint to paint my method of painting. And I wrote her back and told her, No you really dont"
Bob Ross,I had to put out this much paint cause I have a mean director here and if I run out of paint she has no sense of humor. Shed come over here and hurt my body if I have to stop and put paint
Bob Ross,"But at home you can always add more color. I put a lot of paint out here so I dont have to stop in the middle of a show and add paint. Thats all, thats all"
Bob Ross,"Its like, people ask sometime, they say, I bought a palette and it doesnt look like yours.  Well, the only reason is I take sandpaper and I dull this a little bit in shine"
Bob Ross,Same as we paint the knives black. We cover all the brush ferrules with tape. But its the same thing you have
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets take our ol fan brush and go right into that good dark color and lets build us some nice trees. I like evergreen trees and theyre fun to make and one lives right there in our world"
Bob Ross,"We take the corner of the brush, were just gonna work him back and forth and back and forth and let him just work his way right on down to about there. He needs a friend so we give him another one"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a whole herd of trees back here. Is that what you call a bunch of trees. Or maybe its a flock of trees, I dont know. A lot of trees anyway. Stand of trees, thats what they call it"
Bob Ross,"There, a few little ones that just live in between. Theres one. Okay, maybe shoot over in here. Lets just put the indication of a few"
Bob Ross,And well pick out a few of those and put some little branches on them. Thatll make the rest of em look like theres just a lot of little trees behind back here. Give this one a few little arms
Bob Ross,"Sometimes when youre doing little trees you can do little tricks like just making a stem. Take the corner of the brush, grab it and flick out a few little limbs"
Bob Ross,"Then when you paint other things over it close to it, those show and it looks like theres a very delicate little tree back in there, too. It makes your life easier. There"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, were gonna, Im gonna tell you what. Lets get crazy, lets have a big ol tree that lives right there. Big ol tree, I like a big strong tree here and there"
Bob Ross,"There he comes right across our mountain. Oh, thats all right we know hes back there. And you learned how to do it so its not wasted time. There"
Bob Ross,"I change my mind so many times when Im doing a painting. I dont try to leave spaces open. I just paint the background, then I paint the foreground and I make up my mind as I go"
Bob Ross,That way Im not committed and if I make a mistake nobody knows it but me. We dont make mistakes. laughs Take a little brown and white. Little brown and white and this Dark Sienna
Bob Ross,"Pull up, get our little roll of paint. Let me do that again,. little roll of paint. Lets go up in here and in our world we have some trunks showing in some of our trees"
Bob Ross,"Not all of them but here and there we see the indication of a few little trunks. Sticks, twigs, whatever. Take another little fan brush. I got a number three fan brush, it doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Take some dark green and I made this just from the tree color mixed with yellow. You can make it black and yellow, Sap Green and yellow, whatever"
Bob Ross,And well come back up here and lets just put the indication of some nice highlights on our tree. Just some indications. Im gonna leave some of them very dark
Bob Ross,"I dont want all of em with highlights. I wanna keep that illusion that theres trees far away, too. There we go. I think thats about all we need. Now, lets get crazy"
Bob Ross,"Lets take and use the same ol color we were using for trees add a little brown to it. Maybe right about here. Tell you what. Maybe theres a nice land there that comes, there it is"
Bob Ross,"If you just hunt around for it youll find it. Comes all the way down like that. There we are. Go right into some of the yellows and Yellow Ochre, Indian Yellow, touch of Bright Red and then into dull"
Bob Ross,"We can begin putting maybe some little grassy areas back in here. There they are. Idnt it fantastic. And you can do it, you really can do this"
Bob Ross,"All you need is an old brush, a few oil paints, a little imagination, devote a little time to practice and you can do this. You really can"
Bob Ross,"I think in one of the earlier shows we showed you just hundreds of photos of paintings that people had done and sent into us. You can do that, too"
Bob Ross,"No doubt in my mind and if theres no doubt in my mind there certainly shouldnt be any in yours. There we go. We got a second or two left here, lets get crazy"
Bob Ross,I think maybe we have a little house that lives right here. Use this little small knife and get in here. Just make this house very small. Just scrape out a little shape
Bob Ross,"By scraping it out, that removes excess paint. A little brown, too. This is sort of a long house on this one. Just block it in here. Well, whoever lives here has one spectacular view, doesnt he"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little Bright Red, little Dark Sienna, little touch of white. This makes sort of a nice pinky color and just go puffs air out rhythmically"
Bob Ross,"Gotta make that little noise, though, or it wont work"
Bob Ross,And sometime when I do demonstrations for PBS stations across the country I have some of my young friends come and theyll make these little noises and theyre better at it than I am
Bob Ross,I have met so many super young people and theyre doing some of the most fantastic painting that youve ever seen. Im proud of em. Proud of em
Bob Ross,"Take some white, a little Dark Sienna, a little Van Dyke Brown, mmm hmm, cut us off a little paint and lets just go in here and just put a little front on this cabin like so. There"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna leave this side over here very dark, just a little on it. Dont want it, dont want it to be too light. Dont want it too light"
Bob Ross,Cause in my mind the lights striking right across from there and so. Take a little touch of brown make a little door. Gotta have a little door for him to get in and out. There
Bob Ross,"Now we can go back to our yellows and greens and lets put a little grass around this, around this little house here. Weeds about to eat him up"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, maybe, lets take a little Van Dyke Brown, a little touch of white and just mix it together on the ol fan brush. Maybe theres a, yeah theres a little path that lives right here"
Bob Ross,Goes right on back here in the distance somewhere. And it just plays and meanders or whatever you want to call it right then. Like that. Right on off. There we are
Bob Ross,Take another fan brush and take a little white and just very lightly graze that and put a little bit highlight on it. There. Idnt that sneaky. Now we got a little way to get up to the cabin
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, bring the camera right up here and lets take off the ol contact paper. The moment of truth. This is what weve all been waiting for. Idnt that fantastic, though"
Bob Ross,"I like that contact paper. And lets have some fun, we have a second left. I like to let things project right out of the painting, when we do these little ovals. To me, its just so neat"
Bob Ross,"And when you frame this, its unreal whatll happen. Youll love it. Guarantee. Little bit of a highlight color. Only because we need a touch of tree trunk in there, too. What the heck"
Bob Ross,"We dont want that left out. A little highlight color, well drop that on. Shoot, weve about have a finished painting. Hope you like this one"
Bob Ross,"I think youll find it to be one of the most enjoyable little paintings that you can do. From all of us here Id like to wish you a happy painting and God bless, my friend. smooth jazzy music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. You got your paints and brushes out and ready to do a fantastic little painting. Super. Tell you what"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out, have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got done here"
Bob Ross,"Ive got my normal old pre-stretched canvas up here, and Ive applied a thin, even coat of the liquid white. So its all wet and ready to go. So, lets just do a fantastic little painting today"
Bob Ross,"I thought today, maybe wed do a nice little winter scene. Something thats very cold. Normally when I do winter scenes, I put a lot of warm colors in them"
Bob Ross,"And weve had some requests for a winter scene thats good and cold. So lets do one of those. Lets try out today, well use the old two inch brush here"
Bob Ross,"We want a small, small amount of the phthalo blue. Just a small amount. Pull it out, and then just tap the bristles right into the color. That sure is a nice, even distribution of color"
Bob Ross,"Work all the way across the top, and its continually blending with the liquid white thats on the canvas, and automatically, it gets lighter and lighter toward the horizon, if you just start at the"
Bob Ross,"top and work down. And thats exactly what were looking for. As you know, in the landscape, things should get lighter toward the horizon"
Bob Ross,"And thats what creates that illusion of distance in your painting. All right. Maybe, take that blue. Maybe Ill add just a little bit more of the blue. This is a winter scene"
Bob Ross,I want color to be very strong and very cold today. This is going to be a very cold painting. You may have to get out your big winter coat just to do this one. There we go. All right
Bob Ross,"Something about like so. And very lightly, well go across just to take out the little brush strokes. And maybe, maybe well have a little water"
Bob Ross,"For that, Im going to use the same old phthalo blue, and the least little bit of the midnight black. So we have blue and black, or black and blue. Whichever your preference. Okay, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now then. I dont know exactly where the waters going to be, so well just put in a lot of water, and whatever we dont want, well just paint over, cause we can do anything on this piece of canvas"
Bob Ross,"Anything. There we go. Little more color on the brush. Go on the other side, and do basically the same thing. There we are. And still water should always be flat. Level. Waters very lazy"
Bob Ross,"Its always flat level if its still. The only time its not, mostly when its excited and starts moving. There. Okay. Now, the fun part. Lets wash the old brush"
Bob Ross,"And we wash our brush with odorless thinner, shake off the excess, chuckles and just beat the devil out of it. Thats the most fun part of this whole technique"
Bob Ross,"And very lightly, Ill just go over the entire canvas just to take out brush strokes and bring it all together. There. Now then. Tell you what, lets do"
Bob Ross,"Today, lets just have some fun and make some little clouds that float around in the sky. And for that, Im going to use just titanium white with the old fan brush"
Bob Ross,"And you can do this with a one inch brush or two inch brush, it doesnt matter. Thought today wed just do one with the old fan brush, though"
Bob Ross,"Go right up in here and decide where your little clouds going to live, and maybe, in our world, its going to live right here"
Bob Ross,"And using just the corner of the brush, just the corner, make all kinds of little fluffy things that live out in here. Wherever you think they should be. Wherever"
Bob Ross,"Okay, a little more of the titanium white. There. Now you could also do this with a grey color if you want to really make it look like a dreary, dreary winter day"
Bob Ross,"Okay, then well take the large two inch brush and very gently, just tickle the bottom of it. Just barely blend it in. Little tiny circular strokes, using only the top corner of the two inch brush"
Bob Ross,"And then well fluff it, lift it. There. And very lightly, just go right over. And that easy. Weve got a happy little cloud. Okay maybe, maybe this little cloud has a friend. Shoot. Why not"
Bob Ross,"But work in layers. Do one cloud at a time. Do the one that, in your mind, is the farthest away and then put the rest of them in front of him. But just do it one at a time"
Bob Ross,"Dont get in a hurry, and dont get greedy. There we are. Good clean, dry two inch brush. And were going to do the same thing again. But work in layers. Just like when youre painting bushes"
Bob Ross,"Work in layers. There. Those layers are what create distance between each cloud. There we go. Okay, and that easy. We got a couple of happy little clouds"
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes, its fun just to take your brush and, well actually, heres another way. I like to show you as many ways as I know to make things"
Bob Ross,"Just take your brush and spin in little, little floater clouds. You can literally just spin them right into the canvas. Try to keep the brush moving at all times, though"
Bob Ross,"These are the little wispy clouds that live way off in the distance. They just sort of float around and just make little things in the sky. There we are. Wherever, wherever may be"
Bob Ross,"Little indications right over there. Back to old big brush. And we just gently sort of blend those right in. And as blending, you can blend them to any degree of lightness or darkness that you want"
Bob Ross,"The more you blend them, of course, the darker theyre going to get. Theyll pick up the blue thats underneath, so you have to make big decisions here. How bright do you want them to be"
Bob Ross,"Cause if you continue to blend, theyll just go away and leave you. Go away and leave you. There. Okay. And I think something about like its fine for what were trying to do today"
Bob Ross,I just want some little wispy things that are floating around. So theyre good
Bob Ross,"All right, maybe, in our world today, lets take a little bit of phthalo blue and alizarin crimson, and I want to make a lavender color, but I want it to the blue side"
Bob Ross,"I want to keep everything in the blue tones in this painting to keep it cold. Blue is a very, its a cold color. Very cold color. Its hard to tell what that is"
Bob Ross,"So well take a little white, lay it right there. And then mix some color into it, to see if thats what we want. And thats pretty good. I sort of like that one. There. Something like so"
Bob Ross,"Thats not bad. Okay, cut off our little roll of paint, as usual. Lets go right up in here. Lets have, in our world maybe, right here. Just a happy little mountain"
Bob Ross,"Show you the easy way to make some mountains today. Why not. Watch here, watch here. There. You have to decide how many little bumps there are in your mountain, and how many peaks. Just put that on"
Bob Ross,"Scrape off the excess paint. There. It has some, its got a lot of little bumps today. Just wherever, wherever. And let your imagination take you to anywhere that you want to be"
Bob Ross,"This really is your world here. Okay, see there. And the only thing that we have any concern about at this point, is just the top edge. We could care less whats happening in here"
Bob Ross,Have absolutely no concerns about that area at this point. All right. Scrape off all the excess. You can probably hear how hard Im scraping with a knife. There we go
Bob Ross,"Now back to our old two inch brush. And I want to grab this, and pull it. Now just with brush strokes here, we can create the illusion of beautiful mountains that are far back in the distance"
Bob Ross,There we are. And the brush strokes will make your highlights and your shadows all at one time. That easy. This is one of the easiest ways of making very effective little mountains. Very effective
Bob Ross,"Now, you may have to sort of step back and take a look at them. When youre really close to the canvas, its more difficult to see than if you step back"
Bob Ross,"So at home, just step back and get the old iced tea glass out, and take a looksie at your painting. There. See how those, all those brush strokes will create that illusion. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"And today, thats all Im going to do for that range of mountains. And lets have some fun, put some prussian blue. Its much stronger. Prussian blue is much stronger"
Bob Ross,"Well put it right in that same color. So we get prussian blue, Ill add a little more alizarin crimson to it. But this is a very dark lavender now. Very dark. There"
Bob Ross,"Cut off our little row of paint, once again. Lives right on the edge of the knife. Now, lets come right up in here. Maybe theres another big mountain. There is now. Lives right there"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you want. And maybe he comes down in front, and we can do the same thing again. Put some little bumps in here, and all kinds of little things"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its nice to have little valleys like it. And you leave them right in there. Right in there, wherever you want them. And well just let that one taper right on off into nothing here"
Bob Ross,"But notice that this mountain, this range of mountains, are much darker than the ones behind it. That makes them stand out, makes it look closer to you. There we are"
Bob Ross,"The other thing thats very important about pulling that paint with the two inch brush on that first range of mountains, theres a misty area between these two"
Bob Ross,"That little bit of mist is your separator. It divides the two. Makes them stand apart from each other. All right, lets go back to our old two inch brush and do the same identical thing to this one"
Bob Ross,Just grab it and pull. But pay attention to angles here. Avoid pulling it straight down. Your mountains will look like huge cliffs. Just sheer cliffs. A billygoat couldnt live on them. There we are
Bob Ross,"So, pay attention to angles. See, by pulling that brush, the little thing that happened right there. Be careful when youre doing this, and watch. These little things will happen"
Bob Ross,"But sometimes, it gets working well and you rub them off before youve even looked at them. These things are, theyre right in your brush. All you have to do is sort of shake them out. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"But once again, were trying to create that mist down at the base of these mountains. Maybe well have some little foothills down at the base. I like to do little foothills"
Bob Ross,"And that misty area, once again, just like here, will be your separator. So try to create mist here. Most, most important. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"And with that, weve got a couple of ranges of very nice mountains there. Lets take, lets take, lets take. Put that over out of the way. Save it for later"
Bob Ross,"Im going to take some phthalo blue phthalo blue and some white, and some black. Mix them together. There we are"
Bob Ross,"I want to have nice blue grey color, but with the phthalo blue, so its a little more, its a little more bright than if you did it with the prussian blue. Wipe off the old knife here"
Bob Ross,"And lets take a fan brush. Load it full of this color. Just work it back and forth in the paint. Both sides, full of color. Now then"
Bob Ross,"Maybe now well, here we have some little footy hills that live right in here. Right in here somewhere. Just take the fan brush and tap downward"
Bob Ross,"Try to retain some of that little misty area in there, though. Its most, most important. There we go. Put a little paint out there. Now. There they go, wherever. Wherever"
Bob Ross,"You make the decision where they live. And just drop them in. This is one of the nicest ways weve ever come up with, just making little distant tree shapes. Very easy"
Bob Ross,"And Im going to add a little bit of the titanium white, here and there. See how that sparkles. That one makes him stand out. That easy. But dont overdo"
Bob Ross,"If they all look like that, then they lose the individuality that you see. Lets see here. Well put in some more. Just a few. Then well come back and highlight a few of those"
Bob Ross,"Just so they stand out better. All right. This is a very simple painting, and if youve never painted before, this is a nice one to try. This is a nice one. Cause itll work for you, very easy"
Bob Ross,"Okay, back to little of the titanium white right on the brush, so that we get variations of the same color. Different hues or values of the same color, whatever you want to call it. There"
Bob Ross,Just make all kinds of little things. Something like so. These trees are so pretty. Its one of the nicest places
Bob Ross,"My little squirrel, if youve watched some of the other shows, this would be one of the places my little squirrel would love to live, right in here"
Bob Ross,"And I want to show you a little piece of film that we made, and this is my little squirrel out on the big hunt. And hes out doing whatever squirrels do in the deep, deep woods. Look at this"
Bob Ross,Isnt he the cutest little devil. Hes fighting his way through the forest there. Uh oh. laughs Theres the forest
Bob Ross,"For some reason, I dont really understand it, those little squirrels seem to like hair. I think it reminds them of their nest"
Bob Ross,"But thats, if you havent seen him before, thats the little squirrel we call Peapod. The pocket squirrel, cause he likes to live in my pocket. Hes a character"
Bob Ross,Weve shown him several times in this series. I hope you enjoy him. Ive just taken a two inch brush and tapped the base of this little bit to just to soften. I want that misty area. Okay
Bob Ross,"Take a little more of the titanium white, and just sparkle up a few more of these little areas so they stand out. Just a few. I want to keep this very cold, though. Very cold. There"
Bob Ross,"And then very lightly, lift upward. Just enough to, to blend the base of that all in there. Okay"
Bob Ross,"And maybe under the little foothills back here, maybe, maybe in our world, theres a little bit of snow. So for that, well take the knife. Take a little white. Cut off a little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"And begin thinking about how the snow would lay out here. There. Just pull it. Gently pull. Something like this. There. So see, this is a very, very simple little painting"
Bob Ross,"You shouldnt have any trouble doing this one. This is one that our instructors would teach probably, first or second day in class"
Bob Ross,"We have instructors that travel all over the country teaching people this. You cannot believe what, what people are doing"
Bob Ross,"In one of the earlier shows this series, I showed a, several boards of paintings that people have sent in. Thats just fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Okay. Tell you what"
Bob Ross,"I want some reflections on the end. So Im going into that same old dark blue color that we had, two inch brush. Just going to grab right underneath the snow and pull straight down. Straight down, now"
Bob Ross,"Little more of the paint. Straight down. Straight down, there we go. That quick. We add some little reflections under our bank way back here. Very lightly, go across. All right"
Bob Ross,Take a little touch of the liquid white. We can go right back in here. And well just cut in a little water line. This sort of separates where the land and the water come together. Its your separator
Bob Ross,And it also cleans up the base here. Its a way of cleaning up the bottom of your snow and making it look really nice. There we are
Bob Ross,"Really hope you like seeing that little, little squirrel, little Peapod. He lives in my house with me. You wouldnt believe"
Bob Ross,"I have two squirrels that live in the house, and I have three that live outside. Theyre about ready to be turned loose now"
Bob Ross,"But the ones that live in the house, if youve never lived with a squirrel, you havent lived. Because they will get into absolutely everything. chuckles Every single thing in the house"
Bob Ross,"And I find, because they hide nuts all over the house too when they run around, and Ill find nuts in everything, from my pockets to my shoes. But its fun. Its fun"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some prussian blue, black, alizarin crimson, if youre willing, throw some Van Dyke brown there, too. Doesnt matter. Good, dark, dark color. Okay, and we clean off the old knife here"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what. Its time for your bravery test. Lets take the old two inch brush and go right into that pile of paint. But today, I want to bring this brush to a nice, chiseled edge"
Bob Ross,"So to do that, bring it through the paint, wiggle it. That pulls the paint down to the end of the bristles. Wiggle it. And then go through, and sharpen it, just like you would a fine knife"
Bob Ross,"Look how sharp that brush is. But you can bring it to a very sharp chiseled edge. Very sharp, okay. Now then, with that, maybe in our world, you know me, I like big trees in my paintings"
Bob Ross,"Take the corner, and we just push upward. And lets make the indication of a big evergreen that lives right here in the corner of the canvas. Great big evergreen. Strong, powerful"
Bob Ross,"He sits here, watches out for all the little things that live here. And what a view that he has. There we are. But use just the corner and push upward"
Bob Ross,"And thats whatll create all those little leafy, fluffy looking things. Very easy. Tell you what, while we have that old brush going, lets just do this"
Bob Ross,"Maybe we have some things, little peninsula that comes right down like it. Who knows. Who knows. Just push upward though. Bend the bristles. Try to avoid letting it slide like that"
Bob Ross,"See the difference when it slides. You dont have that nice, leafy appearance. Were going to have a bigger bush there now"
Bob Ross,"You see, if anything ever goes wrong, you can always make a bigger bush out of it. Dont worry about it. Dont worry about it. We dont make mistakes. We just have happy accidents. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Im going to load that little brush back up same way again. Yeah, lets go ahead. What the heck. Be brave. This really is your bravery test. Lets come in here and just put a huge tree"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, yeah, what the heck. What the heck. Nothing ventured, and all that. Lets just let this old tree just live right here. Just push him out. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, okay, lets go all the way down the bottom. Something like that. Okay. Now well take, I have several little brushes going here, well take another two inch. Put titanium white on it"
Bob Ross,"Little bit of the phthalo blue. Little phthalo blue. So I have a blue color in the bristles. Okay. Now you see, then well take one corner and go through white paint. All right"
Bob Ross,"So I have blue deep in the brush, and white on the tips. All right. Now then. With that, you can go up here and push upward, and lets put on some beautiful little highlights"
Bob Ross,"And every once in awhile, just drag at one corner through a little bit of the titanium white. And thats how well highlight this"
Bob Ross,"Think about shape and form, and all the little things that are happening out here. There we go. Wherever. Okay, theres another one. Something about like so"
Bob Ross,"And we dont want this other tree left out, so let me load it deep with the phthalo blue and white, and then just the corner, once again. Just the corner, see, into the white. Like that. All right"
Bob Ross,"Just touch it. Lift. Lets go right in here, and just pop those in. There. Now dont kill all the dark in your tree, cause it gets working good and you, you get sort of carried away sometimes"
Bob Ross,"I find that Ive covered up the whole canvas with highlights, and then Ive lost my dark and all the, all the deep shadow areas"
Bob Ross,"And the little squirrels have got to have a place to go in there and hide. Got to have a place to go and hide. All right, Im going to dip the brush into liquid white"
Bob Ross,Then well go right through titanium white. Pull the brush in one direction. See there. Load a lot of paint into it. A lot of paint. Biggest mistake made is not enough paint. There
Bob Ross,"I went through the liquid white first, only to thin the paint, because a thin paint, as you know, will stick to a thick paint. Thin to thick. There we are"
Bob Ross,"See, and we can just put all these little snow covered highlights on these things. And if this works just right, these little bushes will look just like lace. Just like lace"
Bob Ross,"When I lived in Alaska, this unbelievable Jack Frost would come through there and do his magic. And the trees would be covered with ice, fog had frozen. Its the most gorgeous thing you have ever seen"
Bob Ross,"Its cold in Alaska during the winter, but it may be as beautiful as the summer. Take a little titanium white. Maybe we can see a little snow, right in there. Right there somewhere"
Bob Ross,Wherever you want it. But no pressure. Allow that color to break. Just graze it when you come across. And make long strokes. Like that. But no pressure. Absolutely none
Bob Ross,"If you put a lot of pressure on it, its going to look like you, well this is my son Steve, says look like you mushed it in there and just iced a cake"
Bob Ross,"I dont know if thats really a word or not, but you certainly know what it, what it means. You really just mashed too hard. And well put some little grass areas around the edges here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, got to sort of bring it together, make it part of the painting. There. Now maybe, in our world, maybe theres a little twig or two"
Bob Ross,"So well take, well take a little dark sienna and paint thinner, and we want to make this paint thin. Very thin. Almost, almost a consistency of ink. Probably can see it running there. Its that thin"
Bob Ross,"Now, when you have it, you can pull the one side of that right through a little liquid white, and maybe in our world, theres a little stick that lives right here"
Bob Ross,"And by pulling it through the liquid white on one side, youll make the highlight and the shadow at one time. See there. Sort of sneaky. But it works well. There we go. Wherever. Okay"
Bob Ross,"And now weve got a little, little stick in there. Tell you what. All we need to do, take the knife, here and there, we can scratch in a few little sticks and twigs"
Bob Ross,"And we about have a finished painting. This is, as I mentioned earlier, this is a very simple little painting. If youve never painted before, its a good one to try"
Bob Ross,"Especially if you like very cold winter scenes. So I do hope you give it a try. From all of us, Id like to wish you a happy painting, and God bless, my friend. soft, cheerful music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Thought today we could do a fantastic little seascape"
Bob Ross,"So Ill tell you what, lets start out have them run all the colors across the screen, that you need to paint along with us"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, come on up here let me show you what Ive got done already. I got my standard ol 18 x 24 inch canvas, but you use whatever size is convenient for you"
Bob Ross,"and today, Ive cut a little oval out of some contact paper, and just stuck it on. And then we covered the whole area here with just a thin, even coat of liquid white"
Bob Ross,"So its all wet and ready to go, so. Lets just have some fun. Thought wed do a little seascape today that seemed very warm and make you feel good just to look at"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna start with the least little touch of the cadmium yellow. Least, little touch. Maybe reach over here and get a little touch of the Indian yellow, just mix those together. Ooh, thats nice"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up here. Now maybe well have a little sun up in here in the sky today. So well just start, and go around like this. Theres not a great deal of color on the canvas. Not much color"
Bob Ross,"Just work around. I want a circle right here. Now I dont just want to go like this, cause its very hard to blend that out. Little xs, and then paint is continually mixing with the liquid white"
Bob Ross,"Alright, now, about cleaning the brush, it adds the least little touch of yellow ochre. And go right around the outside edge. The yellow ocher is sort of a gold color. Its very very pretty color"
Bob Ross,"very pretty. Alright. Now just sorta allow those to blend together. Can you blend them. Lets wash the old brush. Thats the fun part, this whole technique"
Bob Ross,"Okay, shake off the excess, laughs I just beat the devil out of it. Alright, lets go into a little bit of the alizarin crimson. Just a small amount. Just a small amount"
Bob Ross,"And just, tap it right into the bristles. Lets go up in here, right around these edges, well put a little of the crimson. And Im starting from the outside, and working inwards"
Bob Ross,"So itll mix with the liquid white, and progressively it will get lighter, as it works inward. There, now see these little feather edges that you create by doing this, the little xs"
Bob Ross,"They blend together quite easy. If you made very distinct lines, it would be difficult to blend it together. Lets have a little bit more of the crimson, for the other side, dont want it left out"
Bob Ross,"There, okay, On a good day, we just do a very very simple little ocean scene. I live in Florida now, and we have a lot of beautiful little ocean areas around there"
Bob Ross,"Fact just the other day, my friend Bob and I went fishing. I hooked my first Sailfish. Ive never never even seen one before. And you notice I said I hooked him"
Bob Ross,"Because he got off long before I got him into the boat. But we did, before the day was over, catch one that was just absolutely gorgeous. This thing was probably close to six feet long"
Bob Ross,"Most beautiful fish Ive ever seen. And you know me. laughs We brought him in the boat just long enough to take his picture, and wish him well, and we put him back in the water"
Bob Ross,"He went home back to his family, hes living happily now right off the Fort piers. There. I dont keep many fish. I think you return them back to nature, and go back and catch them another day"
Bob Ross,"Or somebody else catches them. That way, everybody gets to enjoy the fun of catching a fish. There, came out and Ill just go completely across there"
Bob Ross,"Now up here on the top, Im going to use the same ol dirty brush, add the least little touch of phthalo blue and alizarin crimson, and you can just mix them on the brush"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little more crimson, there we go. What I want this to be to the blue side is this sort of a lavender to the blue side. And well go back up here"
Bob Ross,"And very gently, very gently well just throw in a little color right along the very top. Sorta let it blend down, very easy. Now then, I have several of each brush going"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a clean, dry two-inch brush and just blend these two areas together. You dont want to be able to tell where one color stops, and the next color starts"
Bob Ross,"Just let them blend together, that easy. That easy. Now then"
Bob Ross,"I think maybe today were gonna have some fun, lets take and do a little finger painting, take a little touch of the titanium white, and we just rub in the indication of a little sun right there"
Bob Ross,"And with a clean brush, very gently blend that. And it will give the indication of a little sun up here in the sky. But its not real bright or real distinct"
Bob Ross,"Its just a quiet little sun that lives up there, and has a good time. Lets go into a little yellow, a little alizarin crimson, mix em together. Gonna make sorta a nice peachy color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a touch more of the yellow. Okay this is cadmium and alizarin crimson, thats all it is. And lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Very warm little painting today, so were gonna use very warm little colors of course. And lets take just a little of that, on the fan brush. Tight little circles, right across the sun there"
Bob Ross,"Well draw a little cloud up here in the sky. Just let it float right on back into nothing here. There, wherever. Okay. Then well take a dry two-inch brush and gently, gently blend that"
Bob Ross,"The only reason Im doing this is to remove excess paint. The only reason. Now then, lets go back, Ill take a little white, put a little tough of the cad yellow in it"
Bob Ross,"With a little yellow ochre also, ooh thats nice. Its almost white, but its just flavored with a little cad yellow, a little yellow ochre, just to give it a little flavor. lets go back up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now I want to put some little highlights on this cloud. So using just the corner of the brush, Im gonna come right in here, and just sparkle a few little things, not too much"
Bob Ross,"Just a little, just a little, just a little. Thats it. Now back to our two-inch brush, or you can use a one-inch brush for this if youre more comfortable with it. There, and fluff it"
Bob Ross,"Just enough to put a little flavor on the topping. Now, same old fan brush, and Im am going to a little bright red, and white, something like so. Okay good. Now then, see if that stands out enough"
Bob Ross,Sometime you have to sorta check to make sure it stands out just right. Well come right down in here and and well put in another little cloud. There. He just sorta lives right out in here
Bob Ross,"And same thing once again, well take a light color, this is that same color, and well just highlight this cloud a little. Just to give him a little flavor. Dont want too much here. Just a little"
Bob Ross,Its fantastic how you can play back and forth for these little colors and make this thing work. There. Back to our two-inch brush. But notice that were only doing one cloud at a time
Bob Ross,Sometimes it starts working so good you get greedy and you want to do em all at once. But you need to work in layers. That way it works a lot better. Okay. Back to our color here
Bob Ross,"We had our original color alizarin crimson and yellow, yellow ochre. I want to make another one of those peachy clouds. That live, yep, right there. There we go. Just wherever you think they should be"
Bob Ross,"Thats exactly, exactly where they should be. Because this is your world here, and you can do anything in this world that you want. Take off the excess, blend it in"
Bob Ross,"And its just playing back and forth here, back and forth. There. And well put a little highlight on that rascal. Dont need much though. Dont need but a tiny tiny bit. And then fluff him a little"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Okay, now then. Maybe in our world, there lives another little pinkish cloud, same old bright red. And Im just doing layer after layer of clouds here. I want to have a lot of clouds on"
Bob Ross,"A lot of clouds. So here they come. One after the other. There. Same thing again, a little bit of light color. Just to flavor it. Hmm This is going to be a beautiful little pastel painting I think"
Bob Ross,It looks like its going in that direction. And theyre so pretty. I beat the brush just knocking the excess paint thats on it. This is the same one I blended with since the beginning
Bob Ross,So I just beat it to knock out the excess paint. Im lazy and its easier than going through the whole blending procedure. Alright
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take, well take a little of the phthalo blue and the alizarin crimson, and just mix a little on the brush. Heck, I just want a little tiny bit here. A lot of the color"
Bob Ross,"But this time Im going more to the red side. And down in here, lets put in some little cloud shapes that just float around down in here for this lavender"
Bob Ross,"Using the corner of the brush, making little tiny circles. Tiny little circles, there you go. Just drop em in. Let em go. There, a little bit more color on the brush"
Bob Ross,And well put some right over in here. Notice its getting darker and darker as we get away from the sun in this because thats the light source. Everything gets darker as we work our way from that
Bob Ross,"There we are. Okay. Shoot when we have that color maybe up here in the sky, theres a little floaters that live up here too. Dont leave the top out. I almost got carried away there"
Bob Ross,"So well put a couple little floaters up in there. Maybe even, yeah why not we dont want the top left out here, well just have little floaters on both sides. And very lightly. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Something about like so. You know in one of the earlier shows, while Im doing this cause Im just doing the same thing"
Bob Ross,"One of the earlier shows I showed a little deer, that I had the opportunity to meet. And we got so many calls about that little rascal"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna show him to you again, see if you like this little devil. He is one of the most precious little creatures that you could ever imagine"
Bob Ross,"And I had the opportunity to spend a, about half a day with him. And Diana Schaffer, the bird-lady here in Mosi was taking care of him. But isnt he a gorgeous little character"
Bob Ross,"laughs I tell you, you could fall in love with these, and you know I just dont have the heart to shoot Bambi anymore. Once you hold one of these, you just, your deer hunting days are over"
Bob Ross,"Or at least for me it is. I get so attached to em, I just want to keep em as pets. Move them right in the house. Ive got enough creatures in the house"
Bob Ross,"Now thats all I need is a deer running around the living room. There we are. Im just putting in some little sky things here while youre watching, same procedure, Im not doing anything different"
Bob Ross,"And we had to, had to give him a little drink and you notice how big that bottle was. I think there was a coke bottle he was drinking out of. I sure hope you enjoyed seeing him again"
Bob Ross,"Okay, got a few little clouds here and there. But see how that dark color and I just highlighted it with the same color but it makes so many different planes in here. The distance is so great"
Bob Ross,"I only need a little of that same highlight color. Just basically bright red, a little white, thats all Im using. I do so to highlight these little things up here on top too"
Bob Ross,"We dont want them left out. Phew, nothing worse than a mad cloud. There. And with a big brush, just gently blend that. Thats all you have to do. That sorta brings it all together"
Bob Ross,"And makes them very effective little clouds. Time to wash a brush or two. As you know, this is my favorite thing. laughs Cause I get even with the crew for picking on me here. They will do too"
Bob Ross,"Really get em. There, and we wash our brushes with odorless paint thinner. And just beat the devil out of them to dry em. Its important that these brushes are dry"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe well have some water back here. Normally if youve painted with me before, I do the bottom of these with liquid-clear. And I do that when I don t want to dilute color"
Bob Ross,"Today I want to dilute color, I want the, I want this to be much softer. So all you have to decide where your horizons gonna be, take your brush, and pull across"
Bob Ross,"Or you can do like we do in some of the other ones, take the masking tape, and put across there so you have a nice perfectly straight line. But what the heck"
Bob Ross,"You just take the brush and do it, either way. A bit more color. There we go. And I thought, as I said, I thought today wed just do more of a Florida-type seascape"
Bob Ross,"Instead I like to do the ones from the West Coast where you have big rocks and cliffs, and crashing waves. But lets just do a little quiet one today"
Bob Ross,"My friends in Florida have got onto me because I havent really done many Florida seascapes. There so we take, now that the brush is going, put a little crimson right on the same brush"
Bob Ross,"And youll add it right in here. Just alizarin crimson right on the same brush. So we have a lavender, to the reddish side now. Little more of the crimson, ooh thats nice"
Bob Ross,"Okay, thats looks very pleasant. And just sorta blend em together. Now then, have to make some big decisions. Lets figure out first of all, where our major waves are gonna be"
Bob Ross,"If were gonna have a little, a little crash here. Come right up in here, let me show you how to get that, just figure out basically where its gonna be"
Bob Ross,"If I take just a little white paint on the fan brush or the script liner brush, and lay in a basic shape for the major wave. And other than that, we dont much care"
Bob Ross,"Other than that, thats our main point. Just take white paint, lay that little rascal in. Now your waves gonna crash over like that. That helps you put a little doer in there like that"
Bob Ross,"In the background back here, a little white on the brush. We can just begin putting the indication of all kinda of little things. Use a little rocking stroke, and Im really exaggerating there"
Bob Ross,"But, so it gives the impression of little waves that are happening, way back in there. There, let all these little things just happen. But dont kill all your dark color"
Bob Ross,"If you kill all the dark color, of course you dont have any dark left. There we are. And we just let it go on right over there. Here Im just gonna blend that paint back. Just blend it back"
Bob Ross,But its most important that you save a dark area right there. Most important. That gives the trough in between little waves
Bob Ross,"Since this is going to be a Florida-type seascape, we dont want a lot of crashing waves here. Waves are pretty calm in Florida. Unless you have one of the big hurricanes that come"
Bob Ross,"Then they get a little wild. Alright, now this waters gonna come here. And just sorta crash over. Not a big crash, just a little crash. Something like so. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, let me grab a Filbert brush, I like him for this. Put a little titanium white on that little Filbert brush and lets begin making some little, little things that are crashing up here"
Bob Ross,"fake wave crashing Gotta make those little noises. Put a little, lets put a little lavender on. Make a shadow, for our little crasher"
Bob Ross,"This is just phthalo blue a little alizarin crimson, maybe, at least a little touch of black in there too. Yeah, there we go, I like that. Sorta let that come right on around. Wash the old brush"
Bob Ross,"Now these brushes we just dry on a paper towel. Its sorta hard to beat them, its not enough to get in there and work with. Back to titanium white, there. Now we can highlight that"
Bob Ross,"Just give it a little upwards push. Something like so. And then very gently, again blending that together a little. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Leta take a little one-inch brush, and very lightly go in here, just the corner, and just blend that together. You can make it as soft as silk. There we are. Very light"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets take some white, least little touch of the cad yellow mixed together, just white, a little cad yellow, I use a little fan brush but you can use anything, it doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Well go right up in here, this is the eye of the wave, or the transparency, whatever you want to call it. Lets just put in a little color right in there. And let it blend outward"
Bob Ross,"So theres a little light zinging through the water. Now the blue and the yellow here will mix together, and make it a very nice green color"
Bob Ross,"Now with a, you can use a one-inch or a two-inch to do this. Just gently blend it, just blend it. In little tiny circles, till it all comes together. And there, so now we have a little eye"
Bob Ross,"Lets have some fun. Shoot, Ill take a little knife, and a little touch of the titanium white. And in my mind, we have a little ripple right there"
Bob Ross,"I put it on with a knife, Im using a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure. You can put in a few little things like that. Theres a little cad yellow in there, a little bright red too sometime"
Bob Ross,"Just sorta let all those colors just happen. There, now with a clean fan brush, very lightly, you grab that, and take it back. Try not to destroy that nice edge. Just take it back"
Bob Ross,And again blending it together. This is where you make the shape of the wave. The curl. whatever you want to call it
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes its fun, right underneath our light source here, take pure white, pull down. Just pull it down. Very firmly. And then go across. Like that. Now back to our little knife"
Bob Ross,"Redefine that edge, I sorta messed it up. And lets have another little ripple that lives right about here. We go right over that spot that looks like a reflection, and its gorgeous"
Bob Ross,"Cause youll be able to see right through there. People will wonder, How in the world did you done that.  And its so easy, it really is easy. And, I need a clean fan brush and Im about out of them"
Bob Ross,"Im about to wash one. And very gently, blend that back. But you need a clean brush. Very lightly, and do this as gently as you can"
Bob Ross,"You dont want to destroy these nice shiny areas that you have in your water here. So be careful, dont destroy those"
Bob Ross,"Okay, we can take our little liner brush, a little bit of white on it, and here and there. This is, you can begin bringing all this together"
Bob Ross,"All kinds of little lines and ripples and things going on wherever. But this is where you really begin forming and shaping your way, a little dark line underneath there will separate that"
Bob Ross,"A few little things that you can see through, the transparency. There. And at home, when youre doing this, put a lot of these little rascals in here. Theyll really make your painting special"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And then, lets take, lets have a little sand dune today. What the heck"
Bob Ross,"For that, Im gonna take black, black, black, black, a little bit of, lets get a little bit of that Van Dyke brown, maybe a little dark sienna, and some white"
Bob Ross,"I wanna brownish-grey color, maybe a little crimson in there too. Oh thats better, thats much better. Almost a, yeah something like that. Now that, lets decide where our little sand dunes live"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, yeah there you go. We just put in a basic shape here. Thats all were looking for. Wherever. Maybe hes got a friend right there. And just paint over anything. Dont worry about it"
Bob Ross,You havent wasted your time if you learned to make these. Maybe that comes right on down there. So we just see a little bit of it through. There we go. Just put a little color in there
Bob Ross,"And thats only so our lighter color will show. Take a little touch of white, and its got the least little bit of that bright red, the least little bit"
Bob Ross,"Pull it out, get our little roll of paint, and very lightly just barely grazing it. Figure out where the little tops are in your sand dunes. Wherever you want em. There, see"
Bob Ross,"Maybe they come right on down through there. I dont know. Wherever, wherever. Maybe theres a little, yeah, right in there somewhere. See were barely touching, just let the paint break. Let it break"
Bob Ross,"There, here and there Im gonna add the least little touch of like a lavender shadow here and there. Just to sparkle it up some"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now that we can take the fan brush, well put a little sap green on it, a little green, a little bit of brown, and I want to go right in here, and just pop in some little things"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna add a little paint thinner to that. I want it a little thinner. A little thinner, yeah. Just pop in some little doers like that. This is gonna end up being some little weeds up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, yep, right here, look. I have one coming right over. Wherever you want em. Wherever, well put some right up in here. Let them follow right down. Theres one"
Bob Ross,"But this paints a little bit thinner. Put a little paint thinner in. And I take a little paint thinner, go into the dark sienna, and back through that greenish color, but mostly dark sienna"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up in here, this paint here is thin. So we can grab it, and start lifting upward. And make, just the indication of some little Sea Oats and stuff that live out here. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Something about like that. Maybe a few over here on the other side. And you can just take a put a little things on the end sometime, they have em. Thats why they call em Sea Oats"
Bob Ross,"It looks like a little, wheat growing out there. Now going into a little bit of light color, this is white with a little touch of the yellow in it"
Bob Ross,"And well put in a few little light colored ones here and there. We dont want them all dark. And theyll show up good against that. There, something like so. As many or as few as you want"
Bob Ross,"And we can just take our fan brush, little white and grab the bottom of that, pull it a little, and bring all this together"
Bob Ross,Its a very nice way of making a simple little seascape that I think youll really enjoy doing. Alright well that I think we have about a finished picture
Bob Ross,"Lets take a contact paper off now, and see what we have. paper peeling As they say, this is the moment of truth. And I think youll like this one. Try this one, let us know how you like it"
Bob Ross,"And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless my friend. cheery music"
Bob Ross,"- laughing Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Today I think well just do a fantastic little painting that Im sure youll enjoy"
Bob Ross,"So lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what you caught me doing up here"
Bob Ross,"Today I have standard ol pre-stretched canvas up here, and as you can see Ive covered this whole area with black gesso, allowed it to dry completely"
Bob Ross,"And then on top of that Ive put a thin, let me say it again, a thin coat of liquid clear. Just a very thin coat. And on top of that then weve added a mixture of sap green and Van Dyke brown"
Bob Ross,I put the Van Dyke brown there just to dull down the green a little bit so its not quite so bright
Bob Ross,"And up here, I was just putting in a little liquid white right in this little spot that has no gesso on it, and just let it blend back. It just literally blends right on back"
Bob Ross,and begins to mix with that mixture of sap green. and van dyke brown that we have up here. I love these canvasses with the black gesso. Its so fantastic what you can do. Alright
Bob Ross,"Now then, let me just mix up a little more paint. And as I say, were using just Van Dyke brown here and sap green. About in equal proportions. Just sorta get it the flavor that you want it"
Bob Ross,"Alright, let me wipe off my ol knife. And back here in the background, I want to put the indication of a lot of little trees and stuff that live far back. way back"
Bob Ross,"So Ive taken a little white, little titanium white, and mixed it with this nice brown and green color that we have here. Alright, lets go up here. Now then we begin picking out little things"
Bob Ross,"Now we can take the brush, use it sidewards, touch, give a little push, for example. See how that makes the indication of just gorgeous little tree that lives way back here"
Bob Ross,"And we dont want a lot of detail, cause these are too far away. Too far away at this point"
Bob Ross,"Now the other thing, see Ive made some little things back here with the black gesso that also sort of resemble little trees in the distance"
Bob Ross,The paint is still transparent enough that youll see some of those through there. And people will think you just worked yourself to death trying to put them in
Bob Ross,laughs Dont you tell em any different. Thats our secret. There. And here and there we can just take the brush and tap in some bigger shapes. Something like so. Alright
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe a little thing here and there, wherever you want em. This is gonna be background material thats far far away, so were not looking for detail"
Bob Ross,"I say that over and over, because its almost as bad to have too much detail far away, as no detail close up, if all that makes sense. I hope so. There"
Bob Ross,"Dip the corner of your brush into a small amount of the titanium white, very small amount. And with that, Im gonna create little misty areas down here at the base of this"
Bob Ross,Just little soft misty areas that just sort of float around. There. Something like that. Thats just a little titanium white right on the brush. And tapping only with the top corner of the brush
Bob Ross,"There we go. But Its unbelievable what you can make. Even that, if you play with it a little bit, you can even make that look like a lot of little foliage thats just hanging around back here. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe a little touch. right in here. Put a little mist at the base of all these little trees that are back here in the distance"
Bob Ross,"And the more you tap it, the more itll pick up that color thats on the black gesso, and itll just disappear if you tap it enough. There we go. Very gentle"
Bob Ross,But isnt that a neat way of making a lot of little trees and looks like background material. So simple. Alright. Lets get crazy today already in this one. Lets have some fun
Bob Ross,"Let me clean off my palette a little bit. Now Im gonna take, well just use that same. got black, brown, put some sap green, how about a little bit of Prussian blue. Lets mix all those together"
Bob Ross,"There. You know, one thing I do want to do here, I wanna take a little bit, I see a little spot up here. I want to take a little bit of phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"Lets just put the indication that theres a little sky showing through there, what the heck. I almost forgot to do that. That looks sorta nice up there"
Bob Ross,"Something bout like that, just to give a little indication. Now we can see a little sky just sneakin right through there, alright. Okay now. Lets see here. Were making a good dark color. And"
Bob Ross,"lets find a fan brush. Well use the ol fan brush to do this. Load a lot of color into the brush. Lot of color. Alright, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now right up in here, lives in our world, some nice little evergreen trees"
Bob Ross,"Just make a line, another brush, then use the corner of the brush, work back and forth, pushing harder and harder as you work down the tree"
Bob Ross,"I tell you what, lets do, lets have a bunch of trees up in here. And if you want to make the indication of a lot of trees, just tap downward"
Bob Ross,But see how that dark stands out against that other color that we put up there. And this will help create the illusion of many many planes in this painting. Many planes there. There
Bob Ross,"Okay, how bout in our world maybe, yep, youre right, right there. right there, theres another little tree. Think Ill put a bunch of little trees in here, what the heck, all the way across"
Bob Ross,"Be a good place for my little squirrel to play. He loves to run around in tree. In fact, let me show you my little squirrel one more time. Im so crazy about that little rascal"
Bob Ross,Im just gonna be putting in a few trees here. This is what I call my peek-a-boo squirrel. But isnt that the cutest little thing. Watch whats in there. What is it. Peek-a-boo
Bob Ross,"laughter He likes to sleep in my hand. Actually once you feed him, that little rascal will sleep just about anywhere you put him. But look at the size of his foots"
Bob Ross,Its no wonder theyre so agile in trees and stuff. With a foot that big you can run up and down any ol thing. There. Okay. But I like to just watch him sleep like that sometimes. Hes so pretty
Bob Ross,"There we go. Im just adding more and more trees in here, wherever you think they should be, or however many you want in your world. Completely and totally up to you"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, maybe over here one goes all the way to the top. Maybe it goes off the canvas right there. Wherever. But these ol trees just live right here in your fan brush, just sorta push em out"
Bob Ross,"And once again, as you work down the tree add more and more pressure to your brush. Make those bristles bend. Lets go back over here, put one right there. Right there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, just work down, once again. Once again. Maybe this ones got a little crook in him. He didnt stand perfectly straight. And well just put a few indications. There we go, something like that"
Bob Ross,"Now then. lets take the ol knife, little bit of white, little bit of the dark sienna, mix it together, cut off our little tiny roll of paint. Very small roll"
Bob Ross,"Now, here and there, and there and here, well just put the indication of a few little tree trunks. And not every one has to have a trunk, and you wont see the entire trunk"
Bob Ross,"but just a few here and there. You can even have a few that dont have a tree on it, cause maybe the ol tree passed away but the trunks still there. This whole big one needs something here too"
Bob Ross,There
Bob Ross,"Now I have several fan brushes, go ahead and let me grab another one here, and lets put some green and some of that same tree color, I mean some of that tree color with yellow, and well make green"
Bob Ross,"There we go, sometimes the ol mind goes and I forget what Im saying. But well get it back together here. Some nice green. Load both sides of the brush. We can go up here"
Bob Ross,"and heres our light source, zingin right through there. There. And we just put the indication here and there, of a few highlights on these"
Bob Ross,"I wanna keep this quite dark though, dont want it to get too bright on me. Cause these are way back in there. But I see the light comin right through there. There. Okay, just a few things"
Bob Ross,"And think about where your lights coming from. In this particular painting it looks like its coming from the right, so we need more emphasis on the right side than on the left"
Bob Ross,"Few of these little rascals here, we dont want them left out. Nothin worse than an angry tree thats after you. Here there, couple little on that little leaner there. There. Little leaner"
Bob Ross,"reminds of horseshoes when I was young. I used to play horseshoes a lot, cause we lived way out in the woods, and that was about the only thing there was to play"
Bob Ross,"We didnt have any video machines or Pac-Man or any of those good things to play. So we would play horseshoes. And take a little white, just tap right in here"
Bob Ross,In fact I became the champion of my school. There. I have to brag a little here. There we go. All Im doing here is just creating the illusion of a little mist right down at the basement
Bob Ross,"The basement, the bottom. Im really having trouble with the tongue today. There we are. Just tap a little bit of that. Something like that. Alright. Okay, now we have to make some more big decisions"
Bob Ross,"What other kind of things can we put in here. I know, lets do this. Lets do this. Lets take a little white"
Bob Ross,"maybe at least a little touch of yellowish green color in there, little yellow and a little green, cad yellow. Well, maybe a little yellow ochre too, I like that. Ooh, thats even better"
Bob Ross,"Maybe I like the ochre better than the cad yellow. But its still just about white. Just about white. And well take the fan brush, go right through there"
Bob Ross,"And maybe right in here, with the lights coming there, maybe its hitting a few little bushes right in here, just gonna push upward with the fan brush"
Bob Ross,And theyre just really sparkling out here in the sun. Just some beautiful little bushes that live in here. Wherever you think they should be
Bob Ross,"But push upward with the fan brush and you can create the illusion of all kinds of little things. I know, maybe theres one way up in here"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that a neat, neat way of making all kinds of beautiful little bushes. You can do this in any color you want. There. Okay. I know what we need. Maybe, lets have a big stone"
Bob Ross,"I like to do big stones sometimes. Lets take some black and Van Dyke brown, maybe have a little dark sienna in there. Cut us off a little roll of paint. maybe, how bout right here"
Bob Ross,"Right here, maybe well have us a little, maybe well have a big stone. We can have any size stone we want in our world. Maybe theres a big boulder that lays over here. This is no longer a stone"
Bob Ross,We just turned it into a boulder. There. Big healthy stone. And one of the neatest ways of making a very effective little stone
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little white, little touch of the blue in there, little Prussian blue. There. Get a little bit of color right on the. right on the end of the fan brush. Lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now by just tapping, you can sorta just create all the shapes you want on this, but just tap. And let the natural bend of the fan brush work for you too. Sometimes that works out very well. Very well"
Bob Ross,"Just tap, think about shape and form. Think about it. Dont just tap at random, cause thats all youll end up with. Think about what youre trying to do. There"
Bob Ross,"And here and there on the edge we can see a little light coming down the side. just wherever, wherever. This goes all the way out"
Bob Ross,"Now then, with a clean, dry, two inch brush, one hair and some air, gently, gently, gently, just blend that very gently. There we go. Thats one of the easiest ways of making just a happy little stone"
Bob Ross,"And you can put a little highlight on there, well take a little bright red, a little white, just a little bright red and white, same thing, and pick out where you think that light would really strike"
Bob Ross,"And you can put the indication here and there of a little highlight, not much though. Not much. Itll overdo real quick. And then once again, blowing barely touch it, whisper. There. Mm-kay, now"
Bob Ross,"Lets have a little bush like that in front here too. I want a couple in front of that big stone. Right there, since we decided this was the basement down here laughing"
Bob Ross,"The basement of the painting, thats a new one. There. But thats the way new terms come about, is half the time theyre mistakes. Oh, we dont make mistakes, we have happy accidents"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, right over in here some little things that just live right in here. Some bright little rascals"
Bob Ross,"Well take our little liner brush, splashing little touch of the paint thinner, little brown, little white mixed together. Make this paint very, very thin"
Bob Ross,"Very thin, should literally run on your palette like that. See it dripping. Should be that thin"
Bob Ross,"Now with that, we can come back in here, and go right over the top of that firm paint, and put in all kind of little sticks, twigs, and little happy things that live back here in the woods. See em"
Bob Ross,There they are. And just wherever you think they should live. Theres one right in front of our big stone. The big stone that lives down here in the basement. There
Bob Ross,"See, when you do your basement painting you can have a big basement sale and sell all your works and start over again. There. splashing Mm-kay. Now then, have to make some big decisions"
Bob Ross,"What are we gonna do with this. Thats the first big decision. I tell you what, lets have some grass in there. Well use some green Sap green, little bit of cad yellow, Indian yellow, yellow ochre"
Bob Ross,"Just make a variety of color, right here on the brush. Push that paint so you get that little ridge though. Most important when youre loading a brush for this. Push it. Now then"
Bob Ross,"think about how you want the land to flow. And with this black canvas here, it will show up so fantastic. itll just jump right out at you. There"
Bob Ross,"Leave some dark areas here and there and itll look like deep, recessed areas. There we go. But pay very close attention to the lay of the land. In other words, the way the land flows"
Bob Ross,"Theres a little hill here. Here we go. Now then, just tap. All were doing is tapping, and the more you tap. the more itll mix with the color thats underneath"
Bob Ross,"That same color we made the bushes out of, Im gonna add a little bit to the tip of the brush, here and there, just so we can show that strong, strong light thats just zipping right through there,"
Bob Ross,"and sparkling all these little things. But dont overdo. The only thing that makes this effective is that theres very little of it in the painting, this very bright area"
Bob Ross,And this is where the eye will go when this paintings finished
Bob Ross,"Theres no doubt in my mind that this is gonna end up drawing your eye right there, no matter what you try to look at, youre gonna see this. And thats good, thats what we want today"
Bob Ross,"Lets take laughing lets take a little bit of titanium white, well just use it on the same ol brush here, and maybe, yeah why not. Maybe, this is water. Okay, just pull straight down"
Bob Ross,"Allow it to mix with the color thats already on the canvas. Okay, make it a clean, dry brush, and well go right over the top of that, really get in there and pull it down"
Bob Ross,"See it makes some of that sap green and brown thatss under there. There. Really pull firmly down, I want it to mix with those colors"
Bob Ross,"You can even pick up a little dark and add it back in there here and there, so you have a variety of things happening. And now go across. Even though this goes uphill, go straight across"
Bob Ross,"Otherwise it wont look right. Straight across. Instant water, that easy. Now. maybe, hm, you know me. I like to get a little crazy here"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some liquid white, dark sienna, Van Dyke brown, mix em together, I wanna make a very thin, thin paint here. Very thin. But you can see its almost. almost like liquid white, very thin"
Bob Ross,Let me get a brush. Lets use the ol filbert brush today
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take it through the Van Dyke brown and the dark sienna, both sides, and then Im gonna take and go down here, and just pull one side, just one side see, through the light color"
Bob Ross,"So we have dark on one side, light on the other. Now maybe in our world, right up in here, lives all kinds of happy little stones and rocks and pebbles and"
Bob Ross,"shoot, maybe they live on out here in the water, we dont know. We dont know, this is your world, so you do it any way that you think you want it"
Bob Ross,"But thats the nicest way of making a lot of little stones and rocks, so easy. There, another one. Maybe some little ones back here in the background. Alright, hm. Lets have some fun here"
Bob Ross,"Let me find the fan brush. Well put liquid white on it, go into the titanium white. The liquid whites there only to thin it. Then Im gonna go into a small amount of phthalo blue. Very small amount"
Bob Ross,"Lets go up here. Hm, ah-ha. I just see, with all these rocks itd be a perfect place just to have a happy little stream. It just sort of flows and meanders along through here"
Bob Ross,"It has a good time out here. There. Just plays through the rocks and falls over, humming Here it comes, chirps right through those rocks. There, little splash here and there. There"
Bob Ross,humming Gotta make those little noises or it just wont work. I say that all the time. But I think it will work if you dont do them. It just sorta helps me. But maybe you dont need little noises
Bob Ross,"There we are. Its always funny when Annette and I go out teaching or demonstrating, and thats one of my partners, and she travels with me and we do demonstrations and teach this"
Bob Ross,"Lot of times though, specially my young friends and they all imitate the noises that weve made laughing so we have youngsters all over going blip, things like that"
Bob Ross,"I just did a demonstration for a class in New Jersey, just recently of high school students. They were some of the nicest youngsters Ive ever met. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Okay, maybe, tell you what, lets get a little crazier. Take a little Van Dyke brown and white, maybe theres a little. maybe, maybe theres a little sand bar right in there"
Bob Ross,Just a little darker color behind it and then well sort of blend em together. There. Just a little something like that. And we can take our brush with the
Bob Ross,"with the white on it, go in here and clean up the edges a little. Think well have a stone or two out here on this thing. Same way we did em before. Theres some"
Bob Ross,"Put another one right in there, and there, and there and there and however many stones you want in your world. Little bit of the blue and white, and once again just clean up the base of the stones"
Bob Ross,"Just something like that. Mm-kay. Well need a, speaking of stones, lets put a big stone here. Maybe, there he comes. Lets put some dark color in there. Im gonna have a huge stone over here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe it comes all the way down to there. I dont care, wherever you want it. Just a big ol stone. Back to our brush with a little color on it"
Bob Ross,"Fan brush, got a little of that blue and white, and once again, just sort of form the top of your stone by tapping. Just tapping. There. Sure hope you liked seeing that little squirrel"
Bob Ross,"Isnt he something the way he lays up there in your hand and sleeps. Hes just so special to me. And if you havent been with us before in this series, his name is Pea Pod, the pocket squirrel"
Bob Ross,"Thats what we call him. Ol Pea Pod. Now, clean, dry two inch brush once again, barely, barely caress the canvas, just barely caress it. There we go. Alright. I tell you what, hm"
Bob Ross,"We got a minute left here, Lets get crazy, what the heck. Take some black, Prussian blue, crimson, sap green. Well just mix all those together. And, take a two inch brush"
Bob Ross,"hm, this is your bravery test. Take the ol two inch brush, load it full of color. Bring it to a chisel edge, very sharp. Very sharp. Lets go up in here. Maybe right in here lives"
Bob Ross,"just a great, big ol tree. Stands here and. watches whats goin on. There. All were doing is putting in some dark, well come back and highlight it. Lives right there behind that rock"
Bob Ross,"Okay, here comes another one. Well give him a friend. But now I wanna leave some of these little areas up in here, where lights shining between em"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets have one on the other side, I dont want it left out. Maybe over here. Whew, why that ones gonna really be a big one. There we go"
Bob Ross,"And really doesnt much matter, because the highlights are where you bring this out. Right now, all were doing is just putting in some base color. Its really the highlights that"
Bob Ross,"that make this tree show up. Maybe well have it setting on a little peninsula, right there. So well put some dark in. like that. Shoot, we about got it there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, got another two inch brush going here, its got a little green on it, yellow and green. So lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"And lets just begin putting the indication of all kinds of little happy things out here. All these, there they come. See em"
Bob Ross,"Just layer after layer, see now you know why it didnt matter what the dark looked like. This is where you create the illusion of a big tree, right in here. There he is. Here comes his friend"
Bob Ross,"Darker, darker, darker down here. And on the other side, we need to give him some nice leaves. There we go. Just a few. Alright. See there, put wherever you want em. Darker, darker, darker down here"
Bob Ross,"Okay, take that same brush, maybe down in here, well just put in a bush or two. There. Just push upward. Create the illusion of some little bushes down here at his foots"
Bob Ross,"Little touch of color under there, so we have a reflection. And we about have a finished painting. Go across. there. So it looks like its reflecting in the water"
Bob Ross,"I think with that, well call this one finished. And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless my friend. relaxing guitar music"
Bob Ross,"Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, for this is the last show of the 22nd Joy of Painting series"
Bob Ross,"So Ill tell you what, lets start out today, and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with this"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got planned for today. Today, as you can plainly see, I have a canvas here thats painted with a black gesso"
Bob Ross,"Ive allowed it to dry completely, and then on top of that, put a thin even coat of liquid clear"
Bob Ross,"We put the clear on there only because it makes putting transparent color on top of this, much much easier. You really dont have to have it, but it makes your life so much easier"
Bob Ross,"Then on top of the clear, I put a mixture of sap green, pthalo blue, and a little Van Dyck brown to dull it down. And I thought today well just do a happy little scene, maybe thats deep in the woods"
Bob Ross,"Ive had a lot of requests for paintings that have big trees in them, so. Let me just show you an easy, easy way to do just that. Lets take an old two inch brush today"
Bob Ross,"Take the corner of it, just the corner, and go into a little bit of titanium white. Then lets go up in here. Now once again, this has green and blue and a little brown on it"
Bob Ross,"This is a fantastic painting to do as a demonstration for friends or relatives or just people who are going to watch you paint, and dont let them see you put the color on, and theyll think you"
Bob Ross,"started with a blank canvas, and then you touch it with a little bit of white, and theyll, theyll absolutely think that magic is happening. And, you dont have to tell them any different"
Bob Ross,"Let them try to figure out how to do it. But these are truly a joy to do, and the black canvases might very well be my favorites. There. Just spin it and work it, keep it going, move it"
Bob Ross,"Just have fun with it. Just have fun with it, and let it go. There. Okay. Now ill just keep adding a little touch of white here and there"
Bob Ross,"And if were going to have deep, deep woods, this is a nice way of making a background. Maybe well put some big trees in here"
Bob Ross,"This is a nice way of making a background that you can see between the trees, and it looks like a lot of things that are happening, and you didnt have to hardly work at all to do it"
Bob Ross,"And this is truly the lazy mans way of painting. Thats why Im here. There. All right. Now then. A little bit more on this corner, and lets put a little over in here too"
Bob Ross,"Be sure to leave some nice dark areas in here. Dont just cover it all up. Dont cover it all up. And the other thing is you can do this with any transparent color, or semi-transparent color"
Bob Ross,"It dont have to be totally transparent. Semi-transparent. And the way to tell if the paint is transparent, what id do, is just take a little put on my finger and touch the black"
Bob Ross,"If its transparent enough for this, itll still look black. The canvas will still look black. You will know immediately whether its transparent enough to do this"
Bob Ross,"Some colors, like the cadmium yellow, the white, are very opaque. Other colors are semi-transparent, and some are very tranparent. So, test a little"
Bob Ross,Youll find exactly what youre looking for that way. All right. We just sort of wind it up and play with it here and there
Bob Ross,"And when youre doing this, maybe its a good thing to step back and take a look-see and see what it looks like. If it needs to be blended more, just blend it a little more"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes you need to go back and add some little light spots or you could even go back with the original color, the green and the blue, and put dark back in here if you wanted to"
Bob Ross,"If you overdo this light. There. Just sort of wind it up like a. Ok down here at the bottom, I want it to be much darker, so Im not putting much color here"
Bob Ross,I want it to really look like its far away. Something like that. All right
Bob Ross,"Then very lightly just brush across it, and that will take out the brush strokes and let you sort of take a look at what you have"
Bob Ross,"And if you have one that you dont like, or its too bright, you can change it. Or you could move it, anything that you want to do. Anything that you want to do in here. All right. Now then"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, lets find an old thin brush today. lets go ahead into a little touch of the, a little touch of the midnight black"
Bob Ross,"Just load the brush full of color, and lets begin making a few trees in the background back here. In my mind I see a tree, it goes right there"
Bob Ross,"Just pull straight down, applying more pressure as you work down the tree, and that will give you a nice trunk, that easy. That easy. Its the easiest kind of tree to make there is"
Bob Ross,"Take a little white, a little white, be right back, get a little touch of the bright red. Just a little. Its very, very strong. Eat up your whole world"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now, Im gonna get a little bit more paint, put it right here, and that one, well put some of the pthalo blue. Maybe even add a little black to that to dull it. Thats better"
Bob Ross,"Dont want it too bright. Use black to dull. There, All right. Now then. Clean the old knife. In my world, today, I think the light is coming from the right"
Bob Ross,"If youre right-handed, as Ive mentioned before, you will probably find that its easier to have the light coming from the right side"
Bob Ross,"So lets just start off here with the knife, and just put the indication of a little highlight right there on the edge here. There. Now then. A little bit of the bluish color, Ill put on the back"
Bob Ross,"Not a great deal. This is just to indicate a little reflected light. Now we take a little bit of the pure black, and touch, all Im doing is just taking the knife and touching, just touching"
Bob Ross,"The canvas will pull of what it wants. And this way you can blend all those colors together. And it will actually give this tree texture. When this painting is dry, you can actually feel bark on it"
Bob Ross,"Of course you can feel it while its wet too, but its gonna get all over your finger. So just wait till its dry"
Bob Ross,"Lets take, lets take, get some paint thinner, go right into a little bit of the black, a little black, pick a little bit of the dark sienna there"
Bob Ross,"Once in a while even some of the Van Dyck brown, just to get a little brownish flavor. A loaded brush full of color. Okay. Now then. We can put just indication here and there. A few little limbs"
Bob Ross,"Just a few. Maybe these are evergreen trees out here. Or whatever kind of trees you want. Giant redwoods maybe. I dont know. Just these, just friendly trees. There"
Bob Ross,"A few little arms sticking out on him. Now then. We can take us a, heres one. Well take us an old two inch brush, and put a little black on it, a little sap green, go right"
Bob Ross,"Of course the black and yellow will make green. But black is once again just used to dull. Just push. Tap a little color right on there. And maybe, this little tree up here"
Bob Ross,"Theres a few little limbs, leaves, that are hanging out here. Just use the corner of the brush, and sort of tap some of these little rascals in. There"
Bob Ross,"Just think about where little arms would stick out, little leaves would grow. Its the easiest way Ive ever found of making very effective, gorgeous trees. There we are"
Bob Ross,Its one of the things that were doing demonstrations for charity groups and PBS stations and stuff around the country
Bob Ross,"When people see the paintings that we do up close, one of the things that I always hear, is that I never realized thered be that much detail on it when I saw it up close"
Bob Ross,"So this really does work quite well. It really is an exceptional amount of detail, believe it or not. Tell you what. Shoot. I just had another idea. Maybe, Ill show you a couple of tricks"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, lets take, lets take, I get excited sometimes, I begin seeing things in here. I want to put, yeah, watch here, put a nice little bush, right back here"
Bob Ross,"And I want this bush to be in front of this tree. Show you how to put that little rascal right back in the woods. This bush, or collection of bushes, bushes, lives right there. Like that"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe theres another old bush that lives right here. Just sort of let your imagination go. Wherever. Wherever. Maybe might even have a friend here. There"
Bob Ross,"And, maybe, back here, lets get crazy. Maybe. Watch, watch. See here. Im putting in all kinds of little areas. There. Just sort of blend them together"
Bob Ross,"And all Im doing is just tapping down, here and there. Adding a little yellow ochre, a little Indian yellow, a little bright red once in a while. There. But not much of the bright red"
Bob Ross,I think Ill keep this mostly in the greens. Use the red to dull the green. Just to dull the green. There we go. Okay. We got a whole bunch of bushes
Bob Ross,"And, maybe come in right down here, theres a couple more. But see already, that tree is being pushed back. I want to push it back into the forest. You didnt know you could move trees, did you"
Bob Ross,"Or maybe you did. Hmm. There we go. There. Okay. Now. Lets take. lets put some trees in the foreground, and really push everything back. Im going right back into the black here. Maybe"
Bob Ross,"woozh, be brave. Right there beside. At the bottom of this one, Im gonna bring it farther down. So everythings behind it. Everything is behind it. This is a stronger tree. Bigger"
Bob Ross,"And it may just be that its closer to you, and thats the kind of impression that were trying to make here. That its just closer to you. Maybe, maybe hes got a friend"
Bob Ross,"Well, we said we was gonna paint some big trees. I think, I think these are big trees. Big, strong trees. Maybe, maybe we have a forest"
Bob Ross,"And when youre doing yours, you decide how many paintings, or how many trees you want in your painting. How many paintings you want in your tree. There we go. Either way it works for you"
Bob Ross,"laughs We can start a whole new kind of painting here. All right. And if youre really brave, you can put big trees in here. I mean whooo, big, very strong tree"
Bob Ross,"So why is this, this is a number six fan brush, and as wide as this brush is, Im gonna make this one. Big old trees. Okay. Put a little grass around the bottom of that one. Now then"
Bob Ross,Lets go back to our color that we had here. This is a little bit of bright red and white. Just let it float right down the tree. This is just like youre laying snow on the mountain
Bob Ross,"Just let it break, grab. The canvas will literally pull off what it wants, and give you back whats left. Just like a tax man when you. those do taxes. There. Very nice looking"
Bob Ross,"As I mentioned earlier, this will look like real bark when its done. Itll feel like real bark. There. And you can make it as thick as you want. Thats one thing thats so fantastic about oil paints"
Bob Ross,You can give texture to your painting. Of course I guess you could do that with other paints. Just find it much easier with oils to do. There
Bob Ross,"A little hard to get watercolor to build up a quarter of an inch. laughs There. Mix up a little more color. And, well give this big tree here some. Something like that. There"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that a fun way to paint big strong trees. And you can do this, even if youve never painted before. This is one of the easiest, most effective ways of making large trees"
Bob Ross,"Just, its a pleasure to make them this way. And they work. And people will never believe youve done this. Never believe it"
Bob Ross,"Theyll be looking for the numbers, because theyll know this is a paint by number thing. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now take a little bit of that blue that we were using for reflected light, and were just gonna let a little of that play down the back side. Just a little. Right down through there. There we go"
Bob Ross,"A little bit here. Like so. And down. Shouldnt have done so many trees. This is too repetitious. There. Of course when you do yours, you decide how many trees you want to have in your world"
Bob Ross,"maybe you want fewer, more, somewhere in between. Doesnt matter. As long as it makes you happy when you do it. Painting does nothing else. It should make you happy. Go right back into some black"
Bob Ross,"Let me clean off a spot to work. Back into the midnight black. And then once again, all Im gonna do, Im just touching the canvas. Thats all were doing. Just touch"
Bob Ross,"Get that little roll of paint, and touch. Its so simple. I think. I think just about anybody can do this. With never practicing even. This particular part of it"
Bob Ross,"Some things need a little more practice than others. This one is very easy and very effective. Thats the nice thing about it, a lot of things are easy, but they dont look good when youre done"
Bob Ross,This looks good. This looks good. All right. There we go. So I say this is the last show of the 22nd Joy of Painting series. Its almost unbelievable to me that weve done this many shows
Bob Ross,With 22 series that means theres almost 300 half hour shows. Whew. Thats unreal. Thats a record. Its absolutely unsurpassed in television history. Im very proud of that
Bob Ross,"And dont ever think that you do that many shows alone. Theres a lot of fantastic people that have worked with us, To make it happen"
Bob Ross,"People like my wife Jane, Annette Kowalski, and the people here at the television station. Takes an effort on all of their parts to bring this to you"
Bob Ross,"But most important, is the fact you watched the shows and, and you liked them. Thats what keep us here"
Bob Ross,"So if you havent seen all the shows, as I said there are nearly 300 of them, and you want to, give the station a call. Theyre available too. Theyre available"
Bob Ross,"And if theres other things that you want to see in future series, that were not doing yet, drop me a line. Let me know what you want to see"
Bob Ross,"And if I cant do it, Ill try to find somebody who can, bring them on as a guest artist. There. But we can get it. We can get it"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little bit of black, line our brush, and lets go in here and put the indication back in here and there. Youll have some nice little limbs and branches that live back on these trees"
Bob Ross,"There we go. And right there, and in here. Now if you have trouble making this paint flow, add a little bit more paint thinner. Im gonna put a lot of leaves, I think"
Bob Ross,Of course Im not gonna put every little stick and twig. Sometimes its fun to not put any leaves and put a lot of little twigs. It makes an interesting painting
Bob Ross,"But it would be too boring for you to watch, somebody sat here for thirty minutes just putting leaves and limbs on these trees. So, well just put a few in, show you how to do it"
Bob Ross,"And then when you do yours, you put as many in as you want. Good. Maybe, heres an old one, hangs down and comes across. Dont have all of them just going right off from the side"
Bob Ross,Look like your tree has somehow been just cut off. Half of its gone. Need branches that go in every direction. Some go behind the tree. Some come in front. Some are broken
Bob Ross,"Some are long, some are short. Theyre like people. Every ones different. And thats what makes everyone wonderful, its the fact that were different. The fact that were different. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Couple more in here and there. Something like that. A little more of the paint thinner, a little more color. And maybe, we dont want this old big one left out"
Bob Ross,Maybe hes got a big old arm that comes out here. Like that. Like that. Let your hand wiggle and jiggle when youre doing this. Dont just make them all straight
Bob Ross,Nothings more boring than just perfectly straight tree limbs. Give them some character. There. Theres another big old rascal
Bob Ross,"If these are a type of evergreen, evergreens seem to always have a lot of little broken limbs on them. Thats where you always find little squirrels and stuff sitting"
Bob Ross,"Speaking of squirrel, I really hope youve enjoyed as many times as Ive showed you Peapod, my little squirrel in this series. I really hope youve enjoyed seeing him"
Bob Ross,"Its my way of sharing nature with you, and trying to make people aware that these little creatures are so fantastic, and they need our help and support if theyre to survive"
Bob Ross,"And you can really enjoy some of Gods creations by just looking out your window. Because its unreal, whats been done"
Bob Ross,We have a tendency in our busy life to forget about these little creatures and to look over them. And my young friends tell me that they really like these little creatures
Bob Ross,"But I hope, I really hope that you enjoy them, because theyre as I say, theyre very special to me. Very special to me. But, anyway, you know painters are sort of weird, they like things like that"
Bob Ross,"All right. You dont have to be a painter to like little creatures. Just put a little grass down here, bottom of this. Maybe well, just take it right on through there, wherever"
Bob Ross,"A little yellow ochre, Indian yellow, cadmium, sap green, just mix them on the brush. Let all these little colors and things just happen. There we go. Wherever. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Put the least little touch of paint thinner on my brush. I just dip the brush into a small, small amount of paint thinner. Just to thin the paint a little bit more. So it really slips off very easy"
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes, its fun. It makes your painting look a little better. Put some roots out here on the tree. Just take a fan brush, a little black paint, around, whatever"
Bob Ross,"When you put the indication here and there, just a big old root that grows right out. But, dont put one on every single tree, because youre not gonna see every tree"
Bob Ross,"Some of them are gonna be covered up by grass or things, little weeds that grow around here. Dont put one on every one. Just here and there. There. Something about like that. Okay"
Bob Ross,"We can go up in here, we just use that same old brush to take a little. And begin thinking about where all these little pieces of foliage would live up in here. Things like this"
Bob Ross,"Begin thinking about shape and form. There. Okay. If you have trouble making the paint stick, add a little touch of the paint thinner to your brush. Just a little. There"
Bob Ross,"See, here goes one right across the tree. There. This is really where the paint that youre putting on top of all this on the tree. Has to be thinner"
Bob Ross,"If its not, its just gonna all mix together, and we dont want to do that. We want it to stand out there and look good. There. Wherever. You put as many as you want in here"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna put a few here and there, and let it go at that. There we go. Come on back down here at the bottom. Driving the directory crazy here, running back and forth on this. All right"
Bob Ross,Little grassy areas. Nice little place. This would be just a fantastic place to come and walk. Take your shoes off and let your feet run naked through here
Bob Ross,Feels good on the bottom of your foot when you run across all these little grassy areas. All right. Look at the amount of distance thats already in there
Bob Ross,"We have a big blank spot there, lets do something. We got a minute left here. You know me. Here we go. Another huge tree. Another huge old tree were putting right in there. Right there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe he comes right down to about like that. Give him a big old root hanging out there like that. There he is. Im gonna get a little bit of bright red, white, same thing. Choom"
Bob Ross,"Let that drop right down, right there. Something like that. Okay. A little bit of our bluish color. mumbles more in there. Just drop that right on down. There. A little bit of our black"
