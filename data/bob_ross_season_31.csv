Bob Ross,"soothing music car horn honks - Hello, Im Bob Ross and Id like to welcome you to series 31 of The Joy of Painting"
Bob Ross,"If this is your first time with us, allow me to extend a personal invitation for you to drag out your paints and brushes and paint along with us each show"
Bob Ross,"And if youve been with us before, please allow me to thank you for inviting us back for another series of painting shows"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets start right off today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what I got done up here"
Bob Ross,Today Im using an 18 by 24-inch canvas. Its pre-stretched and double-primed. And then Ive just covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of liquid white
Bob Ross,"This is a wet-on-wet painting technique, so the liquid white is there only to make the canvas wet. It allows us to actually blend color right on the canvas, rather than working ourself to death"
Bob Ross,"So lets do that. Tell you what, well start off today with a little two-inch brush. There we are, well take a little touch of phthalo blue. Phthalo blues a beautiful, beautiful blue color"
Bob Ross,"Just tap a little into the bristles. We dont need a lot. All right, lets go right up in here. Now well start just making little Xs, just little criss-cross strokes, that easy"
Bob Ross,"That easy, and well work all the way across the canvas. Now we start at the top and work down, that way the paint is continually mixing with the liquid white thats already on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"And automatically, your sky will get lighter and lighter as you work down toward the horizon. And in a landscape, thats exactly what were looking for. There, let the canvas work for you"
Bob Ross,"Allow the colors and the paint, everything to work together to make it easy. This is a painting technique that you can do. Theres no big secrets here"
Bob Ross,"People whove never painted do this every day and it works for them. All right, I think Ill have some water in this painting today, I love water"
Bob Ross,"Its easy to paint and well just take, well use that same old phthalo blue. Just add a little more onto the brush. Now still water is always level and I think today, lets have still water"
Bob Ross,"So pull from the outside to in, like so. Thats all there is to it. Well go to the other side and do the same, identical thing. But I suggest you pull from the outside in"
Bob Ross,"If you start here and go across, it leaves a big line and its very hard to work out. There, so pull from the outside in"
Bob Ross,"And it leaves a little area in here thats sort of light, if everything works just right, itll look like a sheen of light just streaking right across your water. Sneaky, but it works great"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Now then, I wanna darken the corners on this, so Im gonna take a little Prussian blue. Prussian blue is much, much stronger than phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"Its a beautiful blue though, lets take a little of that and right up in the corners, Im just gonna add a small amount of the Prussian blue, like that"
Bob Ross,"Now when the painting is completely done, these dark corners will help lead the eye toward the center of the painting. There, thats really all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"And well put a little in the water too, we dont want it left out. Just down at the bottom and let it work upward. There, shoot were in business already"
Bob Ross,"Thought today we would just do a little mountain scene, its very pretty, very easy to do. All right, now see even though were blending across that, that little light area still, it remains in there"
Bob Ross,"Okay, well just blend that color til its nice and smooth. And were in business. Now comes the most fun part of the whole technique and thats washing the brush"
Bob Ross,"If youve painted with me before, laughs you know this is where I really have a good time is cleaning this little brush"
Bob Ross,"We wash our brush with odorless paint thinner, shake it off, then brush thumps. Then just beat the devil of it. That really is the fun part of this whole technique"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, today lets take, well use a little bit of phthalo blue, some alizarin crimson, little bit of black. I wanna make a little mountain in here"
Bob Ross,"And I wanna make a dark lavender-looking color, very dark, very, very dark. Maybe a little more crimson. Proportionately, much, much more crimson than blue. Kay, let me wipe the ol knife"
Bob Ross,"And we just wipe the knife on a paper towel. Now its most important how you load the knife. Take, cut across the paint and get a little roll that lives right on the edge of the knife"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets go up in here. Tell you what, put a little white with that and I wanna make a distant mountain first, little mountain that lives far away. So Ive added a little white and maybe, yeah"
Bob Ross,"Right in here, just decide where you think this little mountain lives in your world. And drop it in, painting is a very individual thing. We all see nature through different eyes"
Bob Ross,"And thats the way you should paint it. There, all were looking for is a nice top edge. We could care less whats happening down below. Our brush is good and dry and well grab it"
Bob Ross,"Because the Liquid whites on the canvas, you can literally move color, see there. If you were working on a dry canvas, right now youd be in agony city. But because its wet, it will move"
Bob Ross,"And your brush strokes will create the illusion of highlights and shadows right there in your mountain. And thats about all I need. That mountains gonna be far away, very distant"
Bob Ross,"Now I go back to the solid dark color. And, come right up in here. Lets go right up in here. I want you to see how dark it is. Dont be afraid of it cause its dark"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna put a few little highlights on it, but you decide where all the little protrusions on your mountain live, little bumps. Maybe, yeah, how about one right there"
Bob Ross,"But its that easy and there is no right or wrong here. The only rule that we have here is that painting should make you happy. You should enjoy it, and if it does that, then its good, then its good"
Bob Ross,"All right, I get letters from youngsters, some of them in their nineties, that tell me they never believed they could paint and theyve tried this, and its worked for them"
Bob Ross,"One of the rules if youre painting mountains, always remember if you can see the entire mountain, its always more distinct on the top than it is on the bottom cause we have mist and now we have"
Bob Ross,"wonderful pollution that sorta lays around the bottom of the mountain and it breaks up and diffuses the light, so it looks softer. There, now sometimes, tell you what, lets get crazy today"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, while I got that color going, its fun to take and reflect a mountain right into the water. Now were just looking for a basic little reflection here"
Bob Ross,"Were not too worried about it being exact. In our world, we can do it close enough, like that"
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes, sometimes you may find, when you first start, its easier to take the canvas off your easel and turn it upside-down and just basically re-paint the mountain"
Bob Ross,"If that works for you, thats okay, any way that it works. Now, Im gonna take, and just like we did, Im gonna pull that color, just wanna pull it"
Bob Ross,"There, once again, the liquid white allows you to move color on here. That easy, that easy"
Bob Ross,"All right, see and that gives us a basic reflection there, may not be exact, but its close enough for what were doing. All right, let me wash the brush"
Bob Ross,"Wash the ol brush, shake off the excess there. brush thumps laughs I hit the bucket there. There you go, just beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,"All right, I usually run the brush across a little paper towel, just to make sure its as dry as I can possibly get it. You dont wanna go up and touch the canvas with a wet brush"
Bob Ross,"There, keep your canvas and your paint as thick and firm as possible. One of our golden rules is a thin paint will stick to a thick paint, so you wanna keep this as thick as possible"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take a little white, a little black, make just a touch of gray, something like so. Little roll of paint again, well always load the knife, that little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"I dont want very distinct things today, just want the indication of little things happening. No pressure, absolutely no pressure. Just let it float right across there"
Bob Ross,"Just wanna give some indications, but not a lot of detail. Dont worry about it, just a little. Sometimes we put a lot of indications, sometimes a few and its really and truly up to you"
Bob Ross,You decide whats in your world
Bob Ross,"There, see make this little bump right there and you can take a little of this, give it a little pull, but I dont want it to be real distinct, just sort of a quiet little place there"
Bob Ross,"There, that easy, no pressure on the knife"
Bob Ross,"I know I say that over and over in the shows, but its probably the single biggest mistake people make when they first start is applying too much pressure on the knife"
Bob Ross,"Then it looks just like you were icing a cake. And thats all right, but it really looks better if the paint sort of breaks and by break, that just means it has holes in it"
Bob Ross,"And thats done by just a gentle pressure, very, very gentle pressure. All right, something about like that. And we can sorta just rub it a little bit, blend it out"
Bob Ross,"Once again, I dont want a lot of detail in this one, clean, dry, brush, and Im gonna tap the base, following the angles here"
Bob Ross,"Always follow those angles and just blend it a little bit, just blend it, blend it. Bring it together, like so. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"All right, now then, tell you what, well just take, that little brush working pretty good. Well just take that same mountain color, same old mountain color, sort of a lavender"
Bob Ross,"Well tap a little bit right into that two-inch brush. Dont be afraid of this brush cause its large. Itll do wonderful things. Now then, lets decide, yeah there we go"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right in here theres a little foothill, lives right here, just a little footy hill right at the base of the mountain. Just tap in the basic shape that you want it to be"
Bob Ross,"Maybe something about like that, it doesnt matter, its up to you. There, see there, now very gently grab it and lift up, tiny little strokes though, short little strokes and do it in layers"
Bob Ross,"Itll give the impression of distant trees that live far away, they live right at the base of this old mountain. What a view they would have"
Bob Ross,"Little touch of that color, and we can go right in here and give the indication of a little reflection of that, that easy. Now then let me get a clean brush. I have several of each brush here"
Bob Ross,"I wanna create the illusion of a reflection on this, that we dropped in here. Normally wed pull down, this time, pull up"
Bob Ross,"And Im beating the brush just to remove excess color cause youre gonna pick up a little color and that will remove it, see there. All there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Now, very lightly, go across and thatll give the indication of an instant reflection, that easy. All right, now then, lets have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Well take, well just use that same mountain color, so we had some blue and some black and some crimson, Ill put some brown in it and some sap green, basically all your dark colors"
Bob Ross,"Some sap green, all right, let me clean the ol knife. Now then, lets grab us a little fan brush. Theres one, number six fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Take a little color, just put a little bit of color right on the brush. Thats all there is to it, kay"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe, lets see if that shows up, might have to make it a little lighter to get it to show, so well add a little white, just a little touch of white. Yeah, thats a little better"
Bob Ross,"Now then Im just gonna take and grab that and lift upward, want it to look like little trees, little closer to us, but living very far away, very far away"
Bob Ross,"Just touch it, all youre doing is putting a little line of paint and then you lift it upward, could not be simpler. There, there, thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Well take the knife, little bit of dark sienna and Van Dyke brown, mix it together, maybe a little white with it. There you go, thats a nice color, I like that"
Bob Ross,"Just sorta play around with color til you get what you want. A little roll of paint and lets go right up in here. And with that, well just put the indication, maybe like, right there, see"
Bob Ross,"See, Im sorry, I get excited. Ive painted like this for 20 years and I still get excited when I see it work"
Bob Ross,"So wonderful, I was a traditional painter for many years and I now call that my agony years cause I agonized over paintings"
Bob Ross,"Little bit of liquid white and well just cut in a little water line, just a little tiny water line. This is sort of a light area that separates the two darks"
Bob Ross,"There, now if you put a little too much liquid white on there, and you think its a little too strong, just rub it, it will just be absorbed into the color. Itll go away, no problem at all"
Bob Ross,"There, all right, that gives us a pretty nice little background"
Bob Ross,"Lets see, we need to figure out what were gonna put in here, so lets take, lets take laughs, crazy time, well take some more of that"
Bob Ross,"We got some Prussian blue, sap green, crimson, brown, well mix up a pretty good pile of paint here, lets play a little. All right, heres ol two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Well take him, load a lot of color into the brush. And we have to sorta make some decisions in our world. Lets just block in some areas"
Bob Ross,"Now then, maybe in our world, were gonna have a big tree that lives right here. Were not looking for a lot of detail here. All were doing is blocking in some basic shape"
Bob Ross,"This is sort of your bravery test after youve worked so hard to put in all those gorgeous things. Then you come up here, some crazy, fuzzy-haired guy says, Put a big tree right over the top of it"
Bob Ross,"But thats all right, there. Well decide where that goes later. Maybe, well grab a little fan brush. Well have some more fun here. Take a fan brush, load it full of that dark color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres some little, maybe theres a little peninsula right here, yeah. When you paint, you begin to see things. Let them happen, just let them happen. Let them happen, dont worry about them"
Bob Ross,Learn to compose as you paint. Learn to take advantage of what happens. We call those happy accidents and they can be your best friend
Bob Ross,"There, maybe, yeah, maybe it comes right on down, right in there, about like that. We dont even know where it goes over there, dont think we care at this point"
Bob Ross,"All right, just wanna create a little mist down here at the base and we can do that with a clean brush, like so. Then lift slightly upward, sort of brings everything together"
Bob Ross,"There, course right underneath that, wed need a reflection, we would need a reflection, so just pull it straight down, straight down. Its most important that it goes straight down"
Bob Ross,"Reflection should be as dark as the object thats casting the reflection. There, and then go across. Give us a little instant reflection"
Bob Ross,"Now, maybe, tell you what, maybe theres a tree that lives right here. Well put some highlight on him so hell show"
Bob Ross,"This one lives a little closer to us, so we can make out a little more detail on him. There, just a, hes got a friend. Happy little tree, lives right here, watches everything happen"
Bob Ross,"All right, now Ill go right into a little touch of the cadmium yellow, yellow ochre. Sooner or later, Ill hit all the yellows and a little bit of the red"
Bob Ross,"I wanna make a nice green color because you had blue and black on your brush, when you go in here, youll get green instantly"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can come right along in here and place just a few little highlights on this tree. Thatll snatch it right out from that background"
Bob Ross,Little more color and well put a few highlights on this little rascal
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world here, maybe theres a few little grassy things that were beginning to see, dont want a lot of detail yet, just a few little things far away. Little sparklers, there they go"
Bob Ross,"We dont know where they go over here, dont know where they go. Take a little bit of our brown and white we used. And we can put the indication of a little land mass here, see there"
Bob Ross,"That simple, little bit of land. Little touch of the liquid white just to give the indication of a water line right in here. Dont want a lot of color, just a little here and there"
Bob Ross,"See how that works, its neat, huh. Now then, we gotta decide where this big tree lives. Here he comes, here he comes. He comes right on down, this is just dark color. Just a lot of dark color"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe he comes all the way down here. I dont know, thats the beauty of painting like this. You really dont have to know exactly where everythings at, it just works"
Bob Ross,"Little paint thinner, liner brush, that brown color. Here and there and there and here, well just put the indication of a little limb, little trunk lives in there"
Bob Ross,"Dont have to worry about it very much. Lets take, well use some of that yellow, greens, mix them on the two-inch brush though"
Bob Ross,"Lets go right in here and lets just begin picking out some highlights. There, just the corner of the brush, all youre using"
Bob Ross,"There you are, now if youve got a very thick, dry paint up on the canvas, you can put this right on here. Itll go right on the top without mixing together"
Bob Ross,But the paint on your brush has to be a little bit thinner than what you have on the canvas already. Itll always pull toward the thickest area
Bob Ross,"There we are, now our yellows are made just a little bit thinner, so that works automatically. There, maybe on down like that"
Bob Ross,"Now Im gonna change the flavor a little bit, add a little bright red, a little yellow ochre. Maybe, yeah youre right, right there"
Bob Ross,"Theres another little tree, bush, whatever you wanna call it, wherever, were still just using the corner of the brush. Thats really all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"And Im gonna dip the brush into a little touch of paint thinner, wanna make it just a little thinner. Im gonna go over several layers of paint here"
Bob Ross,"There, but if you add paint thinner, add the smallest, smallest amount possible. You dont need much, dont need much. Tell you what lets do, lets have some fun. Clean off a little spot to work here"
Bob Ross,"Even with my palette this big, I still run out of room. Were gonna take black, brown, mix them together. Now then, over here Im gonna take a little bit of white and black to make a gray color"
Bob Ross,"There, something about like that. Kay, now, were gonna take and add paint thinner to this. I want to make this very thin. As we mentioned earlier, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint"
Bob Ross,"So now, I wanna show you an easy way of making a fantastic effect, but we need to thin these colors. But if we hadnt started with a very thick, dry paint, this wouldnt work"
Bob Ross,"So be sure you, I hate to keep talking about the paint, but it is important"
Bob Ross,"I get so many letters from people that say theyre having problems and when I begin to talk to them, the problem usually evolves from starting with paint thats very thin"
Bob Ross,"Start with thick paint, then each layer gets thinner. Today, lets use a little oval brush. Ill go through the dark color, through the dark color, both sides"
Bob Ross,"Now one side, one side only, I will put it in the light color. So you got dark and light. Now watch, watch, you can make the indication of little stones all in one stroke, like that"
Bob Ross,"That easy, that easy. Now, pull a little reflection down, like so. Come across, go back to our little brush that has the grassy color on it"
Bob Ross,"Put in a few little highlights here and there, just a few little duders"
Bob Ross,"Now, back to this and maybe theres a little, yep, little stone lives right there and wherever you want them, you just drop them in, several little stones, put some little grassy things"
Bob Ross,"Right around here, look at there, see it brings it all together, little yellow ochre in there too. Just brings it all together, makes it fit"
Bob Ross,"There we are, now this little rascal out here, pull down a little touch of reflection"
Bob Ross,"Go across, take our small knife and well put just the indication of a little water line here and there, sort of bring it all together, just to bring it together"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, I think we got a finished painting here"
Bob Ross,"Really hope youve enjoyed this and hope youll join us for the rest of this television series and from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. soothing music"
Bob Ross,"- Welcome back, certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today wed just do a little scene thats a lot of fun, I believe youll enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got up here"
Bob Ross,Have my regular old 18 by 24-inch pre-stretched double primed canvas but you use any size thats convenient. And today Ive just covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of liquid white
Bob Ross,"The liquid white is still wet. We depend on that being wet through the entire painting. So with that in mind, lets just go up here and just have some fun"
Bob Ross,"I tell you what, lets do a little winter scene today. Maybe something thats nice and chilly. Start with a little Prussian blue and midnight black. More black than blue"
Bob Ross,"All right, a little two-inch brush, and lets just go in here and just begin dancing in some little shapes that hopefully will end up being clouds. There we are"
Bob Ross,"And here, we try to paint in such a manner that anybody can do it and everyone can enjoy it whether you paint or you just watch or you just enjoy watching, we get letters from people, say they just"
Bob Ross,sleep better when the shows on. chuckles Thats all right. Thats okay. There we are. Wherever you think maybe there should be a little color
Bob Ross,"Now since this is a winter scene, I like to work in the grey hues a great deal because it gives the feeling of winter. So thats why were using mostly just blue and black in this painting"
Bob Ross,"Well bring it down to about there. It doesnt matter. Anything that were not crazy about, well just paint over it. Cause on this piece of canvas, you can create any world that you want"
Bob Ross,"Have unlimited power here, unlimited. All you have to do is believe. Okay. Maybe down here on the bottom. Lets take the same colors"
Bob Ross,"I dont really know whats gonna be down here yet so lets just put a little color. If we put nothing down here but snow, this will end up being the shadows"
Bob Ross,And if we have time maybe well put a little water in there it just sort of depends on however things go in this world. There we are. Something about like that and thats all we need for right now
Bob Ross,"And well wash the old brush, cause thats the most fun part of this. And we wash our brushes with odorless paint thinner"
Bob Ross,Theres this green in the bottom of this bucket that I scrub the bristles against. That allows the solid materials to settle and the paint thinner remains pretty clean. And then thats the fun part
Bob Ross,"I usually wipe the brush on a little paper towel just to make its as dry as we can possibly get it. Im gonna take a little titanium white. Just plain titanium white, two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"And lets go up in here and lets just begin dancing in some little things here and there. Just some little pretty areas. There, something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Im just putting some white paint on the canvas. Maybe well use a little blender brush, its so soft and nice and does beautiful things"
Bob Ross,"Well come back and just blend all this together and youll be shocked at what you can achieve doing nothing more than this. There. Okay, let me grab a little blender"
Bob Ross,"Now these little blenders are just a soft, tender, tender as a mothers love as my father used to say. There. And with my mother, that was certainly true. She certainly was a beautiful lady"
Bob Ross,Miss her very much. There we are. And we can go back in here and pick up a little bit of color here and there. And Im just gonna take this little brush and begin defining some of these little shapes
Bob Ross,"You can actually paint with this little blender. And what makes this blender unique, it has a round handle. You can spin it and its fatter than most blender brushes. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Can spin it, sometimes thats very important when youre painting to be able to turn the brush. Most blender brushes have a flat handle and theyre sort of a son of a gun to work with. There we are"
Bob Ross,"See there, how easy that is. And it begins creating that illusion of clouds. Maybe theres a little floater that lives right here. He just sort of floats around, has a good time all day. There"
Bob Ross,"And well blend him a little. But basically thats all were trying to do. Mostly black, mostly black. A little bit of blue. All right, something like that"
Bob Ross,"And thatll give us the impression of some gorgeous little clouds in a winter sky. Okay. Now then. Well wash the little blender. And we wash it the same way. Oops, hit the bucket. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe back here in the background, well go back to our little two-inch brush we were using. Same color, mostly black, a little bit of blue in it. But Im gonna tap it so we load the top bristles"
Bob Ross,See how were tapping there. See the back of the brush is not hardly touching. Just mainly the top
Bob Ross,And with that we can go in here and lets just begin deciding maybe theres some little bushes that live far back here in the background somewhere
Bob Ross,"I wanna start at the base of the bush and then blend upwards so itll get lighter and lighter toward the top. That way the shadows are automatically on the bottom. There, something about like so"
Bob Ross,"And sometimes you can take this little brush and just give it a little, see. Just push. Itll make the indication of a little tree that lives back here somewhere"
Bob Ross,"Speaking of trees, this is where my little squirrel Peapod would love to live. I got a little bit of footage I wanna show you and share with you today"
Bob Ross,"Ill just put in this background while youre looking. Isnt he the cutest little devil that youve ever seen. This is Peapod, my little pocket squirrel. Hes been with me for a long time"
Bob Ross,"But isnt he precious. Little rascals love fresh corn. Tell you what, you could have a whole farm and feed these"
Bob Ross,I must have 15 or 20 of them that Ive probably raised and turned loose that live around the house and they expect me to continue to feed them and old Bobbys a soft touch
Bob Ross,"How can you turn something like that down. Im telling you, how can you turn him down. I would sit and play with them almost continually if I could"
Bob Ross,"I have four, five around the house that Im raising right now. By the time you see this, theyll probably be grown and released cause we dont keep them. We dont keep wild animals"
Bob Ross,"All we do is raise them. I work with a lot of the people who take care of injured and orphaned animals. We just sort of help them out, then we turn the little rascals loose"
Bob Ross,"But they dont make very good pets. They are better just to look at and enjoy. All right. That Peapod can eat up some corn, cant he. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, Im just putting down a few little background trees here while youre watching Peapod there. But look at that little rascal, I tell you he was only a couple of months old when that was made"
Bob Ross,"You know, weve had so many letters from, especially our young friends all over the country saying they want, they would like to see Peapod into a cartoon form so they could have coloring books and"
Bob Ross,all that. So recently I got a friend of mine whos a cartoonist to make us a little cartoon of Peapod. So Ill show you. Isnt that the cutest little thing
Bob Ross,But well have all kinds of little Peapod things here pretty soon. All right. There
Bob Ross,Okay so that gives us this nice little background and all we did was take the top corner of the brush and just tap it in something like so
Bob Ross,"Now maybe in our world there lives a couple little evergreens. Lets take some Prussian blue, crimson, black. Mix them together. Want a good dark color here, should look black"
Bob Ross,"Let me wipe off the old knife. Lets take, well grab an old fan brush. Theres one. Number six fan brush. Load it full of color, both sides"
Bob Ross,"And lets decide in our world maybe where a little tree lives. Big decision time. Right there, see. You just drop it in"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna push sort of upward here, make a little, this tree will have some upward limbs on it. There we go. Sometimes we make them with old arms hanging down. Sometimes with them up. Its up to you"
Bob Ross,"You decide. You decide, maybe, yeah. Tell you what. Got a friend who lives right there. Got a friend, there"
Bob Ross,Ive lived in Alaska for over a dozen years and you become so impressed with the winter and all of the beautiful scenery in winter
Bob Ross,"I know it sounds cold when you hear the temperature in Alaska but you become used to it very rapidly and it becomes interesting. Tell you what, lets do maybe yeah, why not. Its our world"
Bob Ross,Well put one over here too. Just like so. Just push upward. Give it a little upward bend. There
Bob Ross,Well come back and put in a few highlights on these but all were doing is putting the base color in now. The back of the tree if you wanna call it that
Bob Ross,"And well come back and well put then front of the tree in, or the highlights. I need a little more paint here. Didnt mix up enough. Lets take a black, Prussian blue and Alizarin crimson. All right"
Bob Ross,There we are now. I want another one right there too. These two are really friendly. There we are. But you put as many trees in your world as you want
Bob Ross,"Each one us will see nature through different eyes and thats the way you should paint it, is the way you see it. Get a little two-inch brush, lets have some fun. Well take just plain titanium white"
Bob Ross,Snow is one of the easier things to paint in this technique. So all you gotta do is basically decide where your snow lives. And put it in
Bob Ross,Allow it to pick up a little of that tree color because that makes a shadow for you automatically. Automatically. Allow the paint to work. This is certainly the lazy mans way of painting. There we go
Bob Ross,"Maybe over here on the other side well have just a little bit right over here. See there. That easy. There you go, you put it wherever you think it should be"
Bob Ross,"Now we can go back to our other two-inch brush with the dark color on it. Well just use that old tree color, its sort of blueish. Maybe, yeah. Perfect place. Perfect place here"
Bob Ross,"Lets pull down a little thing like so. Maybe well have a little water in here. All right, where does it go. It just wanders around and has a good time in here"
Bob Ross,We dont know exactly where it goes yet. Well decide that later. There. One thing thats so fantastic about this is that very quickly you learn to compose as you paint. There
Bob Ross,"That way you dont have to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to paint before you start. Cause painting is quite easy, anybody can learn to paint very quickly"
Bob Ross,"What becomes difficult is not how to paint, but what to paint. So learn to compose as you work. That way you have total freedom. You could do anything. Anything. Now Im gonna go to a fan brush here"
Bob Ross,And well take the old fan brush. And well just pull that down. Make a little bank right there. That easy. Winter scenes are probably the easiest ones to paint in this technique
Bob Ross,"Probably easiest and maybe the most fun. There we go. We dont even know where thats gonna go yet. Dont care. Well make that decision when the time comes. Yeah, see there"
Bob Ross,"Theres another little peninsula or whatever you wanna call it, pokes out there. Has a good time. You just put him wherever you want him. And, heres your bravery test. Lets put one right in here"
Bob Ross,"Right so you can make that little, maybe this little stream is all dried up or froze or something. It goes way back into the distance there. That easy. That easy. Shoot, Ill tell you what"
Bob Ross,"I know, I know. chuckles You know Bob, if youve painted with me before this would be a perfect place to have a little cabin back here. So Im gonna have me a little cabin"
Bob Ross,Lets just sort of scrape out a basic shape. Maybe right there
Bob Ross,All Im doing is removing excess paint and it sort of gives you an idea of what your little house is gonna look like by scraping it out first. Well take a little Van Dyke Brown. Start right in here
Bob Ross,"And all were doing, little dark sienna in there too, all were doing is blocking it in. Just blocking in a little bit of color. Were not worried about much of anything at this point"
Bob Ross,Just blocking it in. There we are. Well come back and highlight him in a minute. Over in here
Bob Ross,"And well take a little titanium white, dark sienna, Van Dyke Brown, mix it together and well make us a very nice little, little wood looking color here. Dont over-mix the color though"
Bob Ross,"Dont over-mix it, leave it marbled like that. So you have all kinds of things happening in there. A little roll of paint, and we can go right up in here. No pressure. No pressure"
Bob Ross,"Want this to look like old wood. Its old like me. Tired. There. See there. No pressure, absolutely no pressure at all. Now over on this side not as much light would be hitting it. Much darker"
Bob Ross,"Just enough that it shows up a little bit. And take a little Van Dyke, make the indication here and there of a few little boards that you could just see the indication. Thats all were looking for"
Bob Ross,"Need a door. Gotta have a way to get in and out of this little cabin. There we go, got us a door. Cut around it a little bit so it stands out. There, now we need a roof"
Bob Ross,"So, lets have snow on the roof. There we go. A little more paint. Firm it up a little, there. A little bit on this side. Something about like that. There we are. Now lets do a cabinectomy"
Bob Ross,"I wanna chop this cabin off. I know, you think I lost part of it there. In reality, Ive decided Im gonna put a big tree right there on the side"
Bob Ross,"So theres no use putting paint there that we have to paint over. There. Just make it stand out a little more there. Oh, yeah. Okay. Now then, lets go back to our big old fan brush that we had"
Bob Ross,"Bravery test. This is it. We have a big tree. Goes right off the canvas. Right off the canvas. There it goes. Just a big old evergreen tree that lives right here. Man, this is a monster tree"
Bob Ross,"See, now were gonna go right through the cabin"
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes going through all this paint thats already on here, you might need to add a little paint thinner to this dark color so itll go over the top without mixing them together quite so bad"
Bob Ross,Just a little paint thinner. There we are. Maybe it comes right on down like that. Doesnt much matter. Grab a fan brush thats got some white on it. Well go right in here. There
Bob Ross,"And well take my little Script Liner Brush. A little touch of the liquid white. And well just pull down some little icicles here and there. There. Boy that is cold, phew. That one is cold"
Bob Ross,"Now, Im gonna take white, a little touch of the phthalo blue. Phthalo blue. Just mix it on the fan brush here. And lets go in here, maybe just a touch more, a little darker"
Bob Ross,And lets put a few little highlights on some of these little evergreens. I use phthalo blue just cause its a warmer blue and itll stand out
Bob Ross,"It will stand out against that Prussian blue thats up there. Other than that, no other reason. There, a little more of the blue. Well come right in here. Put a few highlights on this little tree"
Bob Ross,We dont need him left out. There. Dont kill all your dark. Sometimes its almost a natural tendency. It gets working so well that you just end up destroying all the dark
Bob Ross,"Keep this basically dark in here. Evergreens are quite dark in value. All right, we could even. Shoot, its our world. Maybe we can see the indication of a second tree here"
Bob Ross,Just lives right behind there. I really just wanna fill this edge up. And well go back to our brush that has the phthalo blue in it. A little touch of phthalo blue
Bob Ross,"Put the indication of a few little highlights on him. He lives in the background so we dont care much about him. There. All right. Now then, weve gotta make some big decisions in here"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a one-inch brush. Well use some of that same dark color. It really doesnt matter. Doesnt matter. And lets go in here and just pop in some little, some little duders right there"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, while weve got that, lets go on the other side. Maybe theres a few over here too. Its our world, we can put them wherever we want them"
Bob Ross,"Another one-inch brush and I have several of each brush. Im gonna go right through, dip it into liquid white. Go right through titanium white"
Bob Ross,"And with that, well just make the indication of some little, some little snow-covered bushes that live right in here. Right in here. See them. There they are. Few little duders here"
Bob Ross,"Then on the other side, were gonna need to put a little snow on them. A little liquid white, titanium white"
Bob Ross,"The liquid whites in here only to make the paint thinner cause as you know, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Thin to thick"
Bob Ross,So we start with the thickest paint possible and then we add layers of thinner paint. Okay. A little fan brush here. Take a little white. Allow it to pick up a little bit of that dark color
Bob Ross,"And work down. Down down, like that. There we go. And we can, heres a brush thats got a little dirty color on it. There, see. Just to give it a little lip on some of these little banks here"
Bob Ross,Just to break it up. Aint that neat. All kinds of little things happening. Take a little liquid white. There. Put the least little touch of blue in it. And here and there and there and here
Bob Ross,"Just put in all kinds of little, some little water lines or indications here of something happening. There. Like that. A few on the other side. Dont want him left out. There"
Bob Ross,"You know if you have time, after you try some of these paintings that we show you in the series, if you have time, take a photo and send us"
Bob Ross,We would love to see what everybody is doing and share success stories
Bob Ross,"Every once in a while when we have a moment or two, we take and put them on a big old board and display them so everyone can see what people all over the country are doing. Its unreal"
Bob Ross,"chuckles Its absolutely unreal. A little bit of paint thinner, a little bit of the brown. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Yeah, why not. Right in here. Lives a big old tree. Right there, wherever you want him"
Bob Ross,"There. But if you paint doesnt flow, add more paint thinner. If its thin enough, itll flow right off your brush. It will literally just flow right off the brush. Just very simple. Very very simple"
Bob Ross,There. And lets go on the other side over here. Maybe over in here theres a few little sticks and twigs. Just some little things that live in here. You decide. You decide. A few maybe back in here
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres even a little tree that lives far away back here. There. He didnt have any leaves on him though cause its, its cold. All right"
Bob Ross,And we can just take the knife and scrape in a few indications here and there. All kinds of little things
Bob Ross,"These little evergreens here, I didnt put any highlights on so lets drop a little highlight on them. We dont want them left out. A little bit of the phthalo blue. See there"
Bob Ross,"Thats all there is to it. Shoot, I think were about to the point we got a finished painting. Lets take a little red and sign this one. Hope youve enjoyed it"
Bob Ross,"And as I say, if you have time, send us a photograph of your attempts. We would love to see them. There. I think were gonna call that one done. I really hope youve enjoyed this little painting"
Bob Ross,"From all us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. relaxed music"
Bob Ross,Hi. Welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Cause I thing today I think well do a painting that youll certainly enjoy
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have the run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive done today"
Bob Ross,"I have my standard ol pre-stretched, double-primed canvas. But today Ive taken, as you can plainly see on the bottom, Ive put liquid black and on the top liquid white"
Bob Ross,"And then Ive just sort of blended them together. So theres just a graduation of, from solid black to solid white. And I think well just have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Now liquid black is exactly the same thing as liquid white. The only difference is the pigment in it is black rather than white. And it allows you to create some beautiful, beautiful effects"
Bob Ross,"Alright, lets start today. Lets use phthalo blue. Its a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever youre at. And phthalo blue is just such a beautiful, beautiful color. Its a warm, warm blue"
Bob Ross,"And lets go right up in here making our little xs and crisscross-y strokes. And lets just put in a happy, little sky here. Just, just one thats a lot of fun. There. Something like so"
Bob Ross,"Thats all there is to it. But make these little crisscross strokes. It blends better and it leaves little actions in your sky that looks like theres beautiful things happening very, very easily"
Bob Ross,There. And this truly is the lazy mans way to paint. There. We work with big brushes and fantastic colors we try to make painting as simple as possible
Bob Ross,"But yet to look like, to look like a real painting. Alright, a little more of that blue color. Maybe, right in here. Well just, well just tap. Im just going to tap in some basic little cloud shapes"
Bob Ross,There. Something about like so. Well just let our imagination take us wherever we want to go today. Just all kinds of little shapes and forms up here in the sky
Bob Ross,Because on this piece of canvas you truly are the creator. You can make any illusion that you desire
Bob Ross,"Alright Im gonna take a little, this is a very soft blending brush, and Im gonna begin blending this. Working with it. Just playing. Having fun"
Bob Ross,"Alright, Im gonna blend this out till its very, very soft. Very gentle. And this brush, as I mentioned earlier, is very soft. Very, very soft"
Bob Ross,You can blend right over color without disturbing it too much. Alright. Put a little color right on that brush. Im just using still phthalo blue. Thats all
Bob Ross,"And well just put in all kinds of little indications. There. And Im using just the corner at times just to blend it, to sort of stir it up, to mix it up"
Bob Ross,"Try different effects cause as you know, we dont make any mistakes. We just have happy accidents. So anything that happens here you can work with it. You really and truly can work with it. There"
Bob Ross,Something about like that. So were just creating all kind of illusions. And you decide how many clouds live in your world or how few. Maybe you dont want any clouds. Thats okay too
Bob Ross,Cause you can do anything that you desire on this canvas. There. Alright. And down in here where we begin to touch the black
Bob Ross,"Well just begin blending color together, here and there, well take a little white. Just a little titanium white right on the same brush. And begin blending in some pretty little areas right in there"
Bob Ross,"Still using just the blender brush. See there, it creates a whole different plain there, right there in the sky, just by putting a little white on there. Make some beautiful effects"
Bob Ross,"This liquid black can do great things for you, especially in areas where you know theres going to be a lot of dark color. Or if you want to grey a painting. Traditionally, painters use a lot of grey"
Bob Ross,"This will do it automatically for you. Automatically. Let go wherever you want some little light areas, just drop them in. A little white. There"
Bob Ross,Isnt that something that you can create a sky like that in just a matter of a minute or two. You can do it. You can do it. There
Bob Ross,"And this is a nice sky if you want to put rays of light, it would be very easy to do. I dont think well do that today but itd be very easy"
Bob Ross,Practice doing some little things like that and see what kind of effects you get. There take a little blue and firm that cloud up a little. Right in there. Just make that cloud a little stronger
Bob Ross,Alright. brush strokes Something about like so. And thats really where that liquid black in there and liquid white. Thats really about all we need. Something about like that
Bob Ross,"You have to decide where- how far down it comes. Okay, lets wash the brush. Thats the fun part. Little blender brush is not as much fun to wash as a big two inch brush but its not bad"
Bob Ross,"tapping Eh, it didnt slash as far. Tell you what, I got a dirty two inch brush here just so we can get even with the crew, Ill wash it too. Alright, thats better. Thats much better"
Bob Ross,A lot more fun. Now lets take us a little fan brush. Im gonna use. Im gonna use a number three fan brush
Bob Ross,"Take a little white, little bit of the, little bit of the blue maybe a touch of crimson in it. Oh, nice color. Nice color. I like that. Little more blue, darken up just a wee bit more. There"
Bob Ross,"Nice color. Maybe a wee back here in the background, maybe there lives just a happy little mountain. Lets see if thats dark enough to stand out. We just want it to stand out from the sky"
Bob Ross,"Thats far way. Far, far away. Little bump right there. See there. Thats all there is to it. Want this to be a quiet, quiet, little mountain. Just barely can see him. There. Something about like so"
Bob Ross,And thats all were looking for. Gonna highlight that a little bit. And Ill continue to use a fan brush. Let me wash it off. Good enough
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit of the titanium white and just load a little onto the fan brush. like so. Once again, this is number three fan brush, but you can use a number six. Whatever. It doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Just want to highlight that a little. so it stands out. Alright. See how easy that is. Gives the impression of a little mountain thats far, far away. I spend a lot of time in Japan"
Bob Ross,"And in Japan, theres a lot of paintings of Mt. Fuji that look similar to this. Of course, this doesnt look like Mt. Fuji, but I mean painted this way. And its a super, super way of doing it"
Bob Ross,"Its very simple. Even if youve never painted a mountain, this is very easy. You can do that. See. Maybe theres a little doo-der right there. Its up to you, up to you, where you want them"
Bob Ross,But I want this one to be so far way that you cant see any detail. Just that theres a mountain that lives way back in the distance. Alright. Now then lets have some fun
Bob Ross,"Lets take our ol two inch brush. Since we have the black up here, liquid black, we dont need to put some dark color in first like we normally would. Normally, we would put dark color in"
Bob Ross,So Im just gonna take a little bit of sap green little of the yellows. mix them together. and just mix them all together on the brush. That way you get layers of color within the bristles
Bob Ross,"You couldnt do this intentionally if you tried. Let the brush work. Okay, lets go up in here. Now maybe, right back here"
Bob Ross,"The base of our mountain, we can begin to see just some little things that grow right up the side here, about like that. See there. Thats all there is to it. Just follow the angles in the mountain"
Bob Ross,"And well push that mountain way far away. Little bit of bright red adding in too. Just to get, oh ya. Little too much. There. Just to flavor it. Just to flavor it. Little more color"
Bob Ross,"But see, its picking up that liquid black thats under there. And it greys all the colors. Makes them look very soft, very muted. Creates wonderful effects. There"
Bob Ross,"But you could make hills and valleys, little plains, meadows, anything that you want back here. Your world, you can create anything illusion that makes you happy. There we go"
Bob Ross,Just put the least little touch of paint thinner on the brush. If you have trouble making the paint stick add the least little touch of paint thinner. There we go
Bob Ross,"Begin thinking about the lay of the land, how it flows, how it curves in here. Because thats very simple to do and it, it makes your painting special. There. Something about like so. Wherever"
Bob Ross,Tell you what. You know me I love trees and I think this is a good place to- lets have a tree. Let me find another fan brush
Bob Ross,"Theres a fan- Lets take some midnight black, prussian blue, prussian blue is much stronger, maybe a little van dyke, little crimson, little sap green. All the dark colors basically"
Bob Ross,"Just mix them together like that. But it should look very dark, almost black. If you put a little white with it you see it has a blue base. But it should look black on the palette"
Bob Ross,"Lets take our fan brush loaded full of color both sides. Both sides. Alright. Lets go up in here and have some fun. Maybe back here in our world, theres a little stand of trees, live right in here"
Bob Ross,"This is a very, very easy way of making the indication of a lot of trees. Load the brush till its very sharp goes to a chiseled edge. See there"
Bob Ross,"It looks like individual little trees that just hide back here somewhere. And decide where they, how far down the hill they go. There. Okay, we got to decide how far up the hill they go"
Bob Ross,You have to make all these big decisions when you have power. There. Alright. Now we have a whole stand of trees. Group of them
Bob Ross,"Maybe, I tell you what, maybe far away right back in here, you can see the indication of some that live far, far away. These arent as dark and theyre not as distinct"
Bob Ross,"So wait till your brush is almost out of paint and then do those. Then do those little rascals. Now we can go back. Let me find a, heres a clean brush"
Bob Ross,"I want to lift upward, that will just smooth the paint out and make it sort of fit together. Back to my little brush that has our sap green and all the yellows on it. Load a little more color"
Bob Ross,Little more color. And lets go right in here Then you decide where the bottom of the stand of trees is and you just sort of cut it off. Didnt know you had so much power did you
Bob Ross,"You really can do this. You can move mountains, trees, mighty rivers. This would be a good place to put a little river. There. As you paint you begin to see things"
Bob Ross,Dont worry about what youre gonna paint. Just start painting. Have a general idea in your mind. All you need to know is the time of day and the time of year. You need to know the time of year
Bob Ross,So you know whether theres snow or whether its springtime. Thats all you really have to know. Just have a basic idea in your mind. Take off. Go. Do it. Alright
Bob Ross,"Yeah, Im gonna put a big tree right there. This is your bravery test. I like big trees. A lot of paint on the brush. A lot of paint. Lets go right up in here. You ready. How about right there"
Bob Ross,"Big tree. I mean thats a big tree. Lets do a little push up tree today, where we push the little branches upward"
Bob Ross,In some parts of the country evergreens grow with branches that lift up and in other parts they hang down. it just sort of depends on where you happen to be
Bob Ross,And you can do them either way that you want them. Its up to you. We just want to show you as many ways as possible to create effects and then you do it however you want
Bob Ross,"Cause painting is a very individual thing, as Ive mentioned over and over on this show"
Bob Ross,"Each of us, each and every one of us, will see nature through different eyes and thats what you are to paint is what you see and the way you see it. Art is an expression of self. Express yourself"
Bob Ross,"Enjoy it. Enjoy it. The only rule that I adhere to in painting is that it should make you happy and you should enjoy it. If you comply with that rule, than how could you go wrong. There"
Bob Ross,"Well that is a big tree. I tell you what, let me mix up a little more paint. I think he needs a friend. You know me. I think everybody needs a friend. Same colors again"
Bob Ross,"Once again, if you have paintings that in your mind you thing is gonna be a lot of dark areas or you just want to grey the overall tone of the painting, the liquid black will do wonderful, wonderful"
Bob Ross,"things for you that are very difficult to do without it. It takes a lot of work to do what it will do automatically, basically"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take a little dark sienna, a little van dyke, a little white, well mix it together, get a little roll of paint. Lets put the indication here and there of little tree trunk"
Bob Ross,You wont see all of it so dont worry about it. Just here and there. Just here and there. Well take a little bit of that tree color and mix it with the yellows and instantly well have green
Bob Ross,"And with that a little bit more. There, now make this quite dark, quite dark. Evergreens are pretty dark in value. Alright now we can go right along in here and lets just put in a few highlights"
Bob Ross,"Lets do the little tree. I think that trees in the background. So well do it first. And then well come back, change the flavor, change the color just a wee bit"
Bob Ross,And lets go right up in here and put some highlights on this little tree. We dont want him left out. But just push upward. Think about where the limbs and branches would live. Just drop them in
Bob Ross,Dont get all the dark. I know sometimes it gets feeling good. grunts satisfyingly And you just dont want to stop. I get letters all the time saying I covered up my entire evergreen tree
Bob Ross,"Leave a lot of dark in the evergreen. Lot of dark. There, darker, darker, down toward the base"
Bob Ross,And that should happen automatically because your brush is picking up this dark color and youre running out of paint. It should automatically get darker down toward the base
Bob Ross,"Let the natural action of the brush and everything work for you. Lets take a little it of this green color. And, oh, I know, I know. Oh, I see it. I see it. Im gonna take a little brown"
Bob Ross,"Excuse me, I get excited. I see things happening in here. Take a little brown, little black, mix it together, little white. There. Alright, lets go. We said there could be a river there"
Bob Ross,"I think in my world, today, Im gonna have a little, maybe a little path, just goes right back through there. We just take the fan brush and drop it in. That easy. We dont know where it goes"
Bob Ross,"Dont care. Now back to my two inch brush, add the grassy colors on it, and maybe, see. There it is. Maybe, maybe put a little liquid white on there"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna brighten the color and thin it at the same time. The liquid white will brighten the color see. Little bit brighter. Now just using the corner of the brush, just the corner"
Bob Ross,"Thats all you need. Darker, darker, darker. Alright, maybe over in here. Every once in while Im adding a little bright red maybe, see. There you go. That come right out from behind the tree"
Bob Ross,You just make the decision. You decide where these little plains live. You can just
Bob Ross,Im sorry I get excited because theres so many things you can create and you can see in your painting as you work with this. There. My son Steve
Bob Ross,"Boy, hes a dynamite painter and hes so young and he gets so excited over this. Its nice to see young people get excited over something like this. Hes 27 years old"
Bob Ross,And hes been painting since he was 12. He sold his first painting when he was 12. I dont think hes ever worked again
Bob Ross,He found out that painting can be fun and he can make a happy buck or two off of it. Alright. See you can just create layer after layer after layer. But its picking up the black thats on the canvas
Bob Ross,And it will grey everything automatically. Makes a very nice effect. Lets go back to our little fan brush where we were making a path. Maybe this ol path just sneaks right around here
Bob Ross,There it comes. There it comes. See there. You can have it just go anywhere you want. But thats just a grey color on top so it shows
Bob Ross,"You can sort of give it a bend like that to make it look like its recessed, or any way you want to. Absolutely anyway that you want to. Now maybe, over here on this side we need something"
Bob Ross,"Lets have another tree or two. Another little tree. There. Okay, just give it a little upward push. Something about like so. Just decide where a little tree lives. Drop it in. Drop him in"
Bob Ross,There we go. Now you can make any kind of tree you want. Maybe you want a tree that- maybe you want a maple tree here. Thats okay. You decide. You decide. Im gonna put another one right there
Bob Ross,"Oh, right over my little mountain. Well, you could have a little naked spot on your tree. So you can still see some of your mountain. Those trees dont always grow perfect. Theyre like us people"
Bob Ross,We have some faults. At least a few. That tree reminds me of my little squirrel Peapod that youve seen so many times. That would be a perfect place for him to live
Bob Ross,"chuckles In fact today Ive got him in my pocket here. It was a little chilly when we were filming the show so I left him at home and I brought his little cartoon, equal here. Isnt he a mess"
Bob Ross,"Thats Peapod the pocket squirrel. There, we finally turned him into a cartoon. He became so popular, especially with my young friends, that weve actually made a cartoon out of that rascal"
Bob Ross,"There we are. A few little highlights on there. Lets have some fun. Lets take. Im gonna take some black. Just plain, ol, midnight black, maybe a little van dyke brown in it"
Bob Ross,"And Im going to thin it down with paint thinner. Im going to make it very, very thin. Just put paint thinner in it. And, well make some big stones"
Bob Ross,Then well take some white and mix with a little bit of that. So we have two different values and weve got the same basic color only one of them has white in it
Bob Ross,And that way we can have a highlight and a shadow. Let me grab a little black and put it in there. Oh ya. That looks good. But the paint is very thin. Very thin. Well take our little oval brush
Bob Ross,"Im going to load both sides with the dark, lot of dark color. Once again this is very thin. One side and one side only through the light color"
Bob Ross,Maybe we go out here swoosh And maybe there some big ol stones that live out here. You decide. You decide where they live
Bob Ross,"Shoot maybe, right here at the base of this ol tree theres a stone or two. And you can put these things anywhere you want them. Just like that"
Bob Ross,"grunts satisfyingly Its a neat way to make a stone, isnt it. You can make the highlight and the shadow all in one stroke. Then we put some little grassy areas right around here"
Bob Ross,"Something about like so. But that easy. You can do unbelievable things. Maybe, we got a second left here. Maybe you want to change your mind. See this tree here"
Bob Ross,Lets bring it all the way down to the bottom so its in the foreground. Its that easy. You can do it. Put a little highlight on it. And that easy. You pull that tree right here into the foreground
Bob Ross,"Shoot, I think we bout have a finished painting. This liquid black is wonderful. I hope you try it. And if you have time take a photograph of your work send it to us"
Bob Ross,"Wed love to see what youre doing. Well sign this one and call it done. There. With that, we have a finished painting"
Bob Ross,"And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. smooth jazz music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, glad you could join us today. Today I thought wed do a fantastic little painting that I believe youll enjoy"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, lemme show you what I got done up here"
Bob Ross,"Today I have my plain ol 18 by 24 inch pre-stretched canvas, and Ive just covered it with a very thin coat of liquid white. So its all slick and its ready to go"
Bob Ross,"I use an 18 by 24 inch canvas, but at home you use any size thats convenient for ya. We just use that because it sorta fits the television format. Other than that, use any size"
Bob Ross,"Lets start today with a little yellow ochre, what the heck. Lets do a painting today thats very bright, has alotta colors in it, and just make you feel good"
Bob Ross,"Itll warm up a room if you hang it in it. Small amount a yellow ochre on a two inch brush. and lets go right up in here. fast paint strokes And we just put a little color in the sky, that easy"
Bob Ross,"That easy, no problem. And its continually mixing with the liquid white thats on the canvas, and so automatically itll get a little lighter in value. There"
Bob Ross,"The more you blend it, the lighter itll become. So you hafta make a decision. How light do you want your sky. How dark. How bright. Up to you"
Bob Ross,"When you have this much power, you have to make tremendous decisions. There. Ok, now lets take a little bit. Ill tell you what, lets do. Lets mix up a little lavender color"
Bob Ross,"scraping Well take a little alizarin crimson, a little thalo blue, mix em together. Proportionately much, much more crimson than blue. Proportionately. Blue is much, much stronger"
Bob Ross,low airy whistle Itll just eat up your whole world in a heartbeat. Im gonna mix two or three different values. Over here Ive put even more blue
Bob Ross,"So Ive got some here thats got alotta blue in it, some thats got a little, and that way we can just sorta play around and have several different variations without continually mixing color. There"
Bob Ross,"Well just use that same ol brush, its workin pretty good. Im just gonna tap the corner of the bristles right into a little bit of that color. I dont want a lot of color on there"
Bob Ross,"Just a little, just a little. And lets go up in here, and lets test it. Ooh, I like it. Ok, we did well"
Bob Ross,"Now using the top corner of this two inch brush, lets just begin putting in some basic little shapes. Were not looking for alotta detail"
Bob Ross,"I want this just to be little shrubbery and things that live far away. Way off into the background. Way off into the background. There we are. Ooh, we hit a little blue there, thats nice"
Bob Ross,"Happy little accident. There. But see, all were doing is just looking for basic shapes. When objects are far, far away from you, you dont see detail. You see basic color, and basic shapes"
Bob Ross,"And thats all were looking for in this. Sometimes we can even do like that, just to blend it. So you just have little splotches of color. Maybe thats way far away"
Bob Ross,grunts Just let your imagination go. Your imagination can take you to any land that you wanna be in. Any land
Bob Ross,"All you need to do is have a vision in your mind and believe in yourself, and off you go. Off you go. Cause I know that you can do anything that you believe you can do. There"
Bob Ross,"And we believe we can do anything, dont we. Anything that were willing to try and willing to practice. Alright, something about mumbles Mmmk, little bit more of that color"
Bob Ross,"And Im just gonna put layer after layer here. So that it looks like theres many, many layers of little things that live back here in the distance. Ok. Now then. Lemme get a clean brush"
Bob Ross,"Ive several of these old brushes going, so I dont hafta spend all my time just cleaning brushes. And here Im gonna tap to soften the bottom edge"
Bob Ross,"I wanna soften it til it looks very misty, like its little layers of mist floating around in there. Ok. Softer and softer"
Bob Ross,"Didja ever think you could take a two inch brush and paint such things like this. It looks so delicate. You can, you absolutely can. Lets see, a little more of the color here. Maybe this comes over"
Bob Ross,"We dont know where it goes. Maybe Ill have a big tree there, so we dont hafta worry about it. I like big trees, as you know. So maybe well just put one right in there. Alright"
Bob Ross,"One of the things that makes this so great is that we do no sketching, no drawing. You dont hafta be able to draw to do this. All you hafta do is be able to hold a brush, and off you go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, take a little little bit of this color that we had here, had a little more of the crimson in it. A little more crimson. Just tap a little into the bristles. Well warm it up a little"
Bob Ross,"Yeah, gettin nice. Lets get more crimson. There, I like the alizarin crimson. Its such a beautiful, beautiful color. Alright, now then, Im gonna beat the brush"
Bob Ross,"That just takes off excess paint, cause I wanna soften this. There we go. K, wherever you want these little things to be, its exactly where they should be. Just little layers of color in here"
Bob Ross,"And then very quickly well just blend that away. But see, already it creates the illusion of distance in your background, and youve done virtually nothing. You could even take, well lets"
Bob Ross,"Lets do it. Lets take a little blue, maybe a little touch of yellow into it. Thatll make a gorgeous green. Little more to the blue side. And you can adjust this back and forth"
Bob Ross,"And maybe lets get crazy. Try that color. Well just put a little of that in there just to change the flavor. Just a little cad yellow, thalo blue. But mostly blue"
Bob Ross,"Just enough to give it a little hit of color. Thats all were looking for. Just a hint. Just a hint. Alright. Shoot, were makin all kinds of little background doers"
Bob Ross,"When youre at home and have unlimited time practice with this, play with it. Its unbelievable what you can make, absolutely unbelievable. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Lets take our little script liner brush and a little bit of paint thinner, just to make a very thin paint. Turn the bristles, thatll bring it to a nice, sharp point"
Bob Ross,"And lets go up in here, and here and there, and there and here. Lets just put the indication of a few little sticks and twigs thatre livin back in here. We dont want a lot, do not want a lot"
Bob Ross,Cause theyre too far away. You would only see major tree trunks that live this far away. But a few little indications are very nice. Itll give the illusion of distance and depth in your painting
Bob Ross,"Alright. something about like that. Ok. Lets have some fun now. Lets mix up. Well, well just keep using that old lavender color we have here"
Bob Ross,"Well put some black in and some brown, alizarin crimson, a little bit of thalo blue. scraping Like that, its ok. It doesnt matter. Wipe off the knife"
Bob Ross,Well just use one of these old brushes that we were workin with. Put a little bit of that color on there. We need some dark in order to show light. So lets begin designing our painting maybe
Bob Ross,"Hey, alrght there, right there. Maybe theres little bitta land right back in there. This is just dark so that when we put a light color on there itll show. Thats really all were looking for"
Bob Ross,"Really and truly. Well worry about other things as they happen. But in our world, we just sorta let things happen. Just let em happen. Very quickly you learn to work with anything that you create"
Bob Ross,"See because, once again, we dont make mistakes. Watch it here. If you was to do somethin like this Ok, watch watch. laughs This is your BriBri test already in this painting"
Bob Ross,"You take the corner of the brush. Lookit here. Maybe in our world there lives a big old tree. We can have a big tree, right there. Right there, that easy"
Bob Ross,"K, now we can take a little yellow ochre, a little indian yellow. maybe a touch of the bright red"
Bob Ross,"Maybe Jack Frost has stopped by here and were beginning to see some gorgeous fall colors, same old, dirty brush. Lets see what we get here. Lookit there. Looka there. That easy"
Bob Ross,Can just make all kinds of little duders. Put a few highlights on it and already we have the start of a nice little tree
Bob Ross,"And if you have trouble making your paint stick on top of this, add a little touch of liquid white or paint thinner. Liquid white will brighten your color a little"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes you want that, sometimes you dont. Want your color to stay pure and use just a little paint thinner. Just a little paint thinner, thats all"
Bob Ross,"Ya know, when I say little, let me emphasize little. It takes very, very small amount, very small amount. And were just using the corner of the brush, like that. See there. Mmk, now then"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little sap green, mix it in here  Sap green and some of our yellows, well just make some beautiful colors here. Let em happen on the brush, dont worry about em"
Bob Ross,"Mixing with all of our yellows, and theres a little touch of red here and there. And we can go right up in here. Ok, look. Watch, watch, watch. Lookit there"
Bob Ross,Well just make a nice little hill right here. Wouldnt that be a fantastic little place to take your shoes off and let your naked feet run through there
Bob Ross,"I like to run through a meadow or somethin, bare footed. Always feels good. When I was a kid we lived way out in the woods in Florida, and we used to do it all the time"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, I didnt even wear shoes until I was about 12. And thats the truth. Even to school we didnt wear shoes. There we are. Ok. See the little hill coming down. That easy"
Bob Ross,"But pay attention to angles. The lay of the land is very, very important, very important. Lemme grab another brush with some dark color on it, we can play here. As I say, I have several brushes going"
Bob Ross,"You ready. Lets do it. We have this whole side open over here. I think in our world, add a little bit of dark sienna to that color.  In our world, our world we gotta big  What the heck. Do it"
Bob Ross,"Do it. There. Steves always telling me, dont worry about it dad, just do it. And thats what well do. Right there. Just drop in a huge tree. Let it come right in front of this tree"
Bob Ross,"Dont be afraid of it touching. Ya know, in nature, trees just grow however make em happy, so just drop it in. Dont worry about it touchin the other tree or goin in front of it"
Bob Ross,"In our world we can put trees wherever we want em, and we can move em if we want to. We can move em. We can do anything in our world. Maybe that comes right on out here"
Bob Ross,"See, already Im beginning to see things in here. Practice painting without really knowin exactly what youre gonna paint when you start. Youll be amazed. Youll be amazed at what you can do"
Bob Ross,"Just have a general idea in your mind of a time of day and a time of year and go for it. There we are. See there. Tell you what, listen. Lets have some water in here, hmm"
Bob Ross,"This easy, you could, look, look. It looks like the right place to have a little touch of water. Just give it a little downward pull. Just a little downward pull, that easy. Alright"
Bob Ross,"A little more dark color over here. Therell prob be something over here too. I dont know yet. Well put somethin in, no matter what. Now, very lightly go across. See, and we have instant water"
Bob Ross,"laughs That easy. And you can see it shimmer. Water might be one of the easiest things to make in this whole technique. Now as a traditional painter, water and reflections was very hard to make"
Bob Ross,"Im just mixin up some more color here. But in this style of painting, it is very, very easy. Reflections may be one of the easiest things that we make. I just ran outta paint"
Bob Ross,"I decided I want a tree over here on the other side too. Right there. tongue clucking gently Its our world, so we can put in ya. Maybe he lives right there, I dunno. I dont really know"
Bob Ross,"Doesnt matter. All were looking for is just a basic shape. Okay, here it comes, here it comes. Right on out, like, yeah. See. Thats all you have to do"
Bob Ross,"Once again, let your imagination take you to all these places, dont worry about it. Alright, Im going back to the brush that has my light color on it"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put a little touch of, oh, scuse me a second, let me dip right there. Little bit of liquid white. Just mixed a little liquid white in there"
Bob Ross,"It thins the color and also makes it a little bit lighter in value. Alright, lets go right up in here now. And, and, and, and. Maybe. Yeah, look. I want just enough color variation so that shows"
Bob Ross,"There. Put a little bit of red in there, now thatll pop it loose. I wanna change the angle here, change the angle. We have one layer coming down, now the next ones coming back"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, theres a little, might even be a little stream back here, we cant see it. We dont know, we dont know. Leave some mystery in your painting. Leave a little mystery. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes its nice to not know exactly what happens. There. Its like looking at a beautiful lady. Its much nicer if theres a little mystery there. Yeah. Alright. Ok, now then"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take, just put a little color on here, Im gonna make that tree, lets put some fall colors in that tree. Well take a little red"
Bob Ross,"We can get a little alizarin crimson too, that, ooh, nice color. Alizarin crimson and yellow ochre make a beautiful fall color. Lets go right up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now I added a little touch of paint thinner to my brush, so this paint is getting quite thin, and itll go on there easier. If you have trouble making it stick, add a little paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"Just a little though, takes very little. Very little, doesnt take much. There we are. See there. All kinds of little doers, they just live in there"
Bob Ross,"Think about shape and form when youre putting these in. Dont just hit em at random. No, not at random. There we go. Alright. And just keep working in layers, always working in layers"
Bob Ross,"Toward the bottom of the tree let it get darker, and darker, and darker. You want some deep shadows at the bottom of the tree. Thats where all my little friends live"
Bob Ross,"I know if you saw him, I gotta little Peapod, the cartoon, up here. laughs Hes on top of my easel. Hes watchin me paint today. See. Isnt he cute. laughs He even got his own brush"
Bob Ross,"I better watch it, that rascal be a paintin on here. Mmmk, lets go over here on the other side. If youve painted with me before you know these little animals are very special to me"
Bob Ross,"I work with people who take care of em all over the country, and try to support em. Most of these people who work with injured and orphaned animals are doing it strictly on their own"
Bob Ross,"They get no help from the government or anybody else. They do it strictly on there own. So for somebody in your neighborhood, and there probably is if you look around, lets do it now, go see em"
Bob Ross,"Youll be pleasantly surprised at all the little creatures you can see close up. And not only that, they need your help. They need your help. Sounds like a commercial for em, and Id almost do that"
Bob Ross,"They really are special people. Here in Muncie I work with a beautiful lady named Diana Schafer, who loans me a lot of the animals that you see on the show. There"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna go back to my brush thats got the dark paint on it. And, we have to decide where this is gonna go. Wherever its gonna go, there oughta be a reflection"
Bob Ross,"So just put a little dark, reflect it. Alright. Now that we need a little water line. Lets take some dark sienna, some Van Dyke brown, some hoyt, mix up together. clucks softly Like that"
Bob Ross,"Dont over mix, leave it marbled. Leave it marbled. Lets see, just pull it, little roll of paint. Lets go up in here and put the indication of a little, maybe a little shore there, little shoreline"
Bob Ross,"There we are. There. Just pull it the same basic angle you have the grass growing. Wherever, wherever. Mmm, we can highlight it with, Ill just use dark sienna and white for the highlight"
Bob Ross,"No Van Dyke Dont cover up all the first color though, just enough to sparkle it, to make it stand out. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Alright, back to our brush that has all the pretty colors on it, put a little liquid white with it. Hooo, thats nice. Little more crimson. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets begin bringing down the little grassy areas and decide where they go.  Where they go  You may call those big decisions. Maybe, tell you what"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe, maybe in our world, maybe theres a little bush right here. So for that all we need is to put a little dark in. You need dark in order to show light. Go into a little paint thinner"
Bob Ross,Lets get a little sap  green  Make a very thin paint. See that little ridge of paint right there. Its most important. Thats what were paintin with. Thats what were paintin with. There we go
Bob Ross,"Make a little happy bush right there. Shoot, were in business. But you can put as many or as few little things in here as you want. Maybe over on the other side"
Bob Ross,"Well have to make some decisions, that comes right there. I know now. Thats where we want it. Go in here with our nice grassy colors, put in all kinds of little duders. There they are"
Bob Ross,Maybe theres another one right there. Its up to you. You decide how many little bushes and trees live in your world. You put em in. There we are
Bob Ross,Want this to be a little darker up here so it doesnt show quite so bright. There. Theres a little bush. Wherever. There we go. But that easy. Now lets put a little bit of
Bob Ross,"little bit of land there to hold all that up. Mmmk. A few little grassy things runnin down to the land, so it doesnt look too much like you just cut it off"
Bob Ross,"Take a little liquid white, just a small amount. Dont want a real bright water line here, just want enough to indicate that theres a separation"
Bob Ross,"Might even want to add a little brown to it if you dont want it to get too bright. Cause it really will get very bright. Somethin about like that. Over to here. Right, like that"
Bob Ross,"Thats really all we need. Now, lets get crazy. laughs You know me. We got a second left here. Lets take, in our world breathy whistle maybe breathy whistle yep, you guessed it"
Bob Ross,"Big tree and his friend right there. Just use the fan brush, a little dark color. We can take a little touch of. Little touch of white with a knife. Just touch it. Maybe this is an old birch tree here"
Bob Ross,"Well just let him go, like so. There. Alright. Now take our script liner, little bit of the dark brown color, and paint thinner. Lot of paint thinner, make it very thin"
Bob Ross,"Then with that, we come right up in here and put the indication of some tree limbs here and there. We put a few little leaves on here, so we dont need many. We dont need many, just drop em in"
Bob Ross,Indications. If you have trouble making the paint flow on here just add a little paint thinner. There we go. Now lets take our little oval brush
Bob Ross,"laughs We got just a second left, well have some fun. Take a oval brush, load it full of color, lotta color. Lotta color. Put a little red in there too. Alright, give it a little push"
Bob Ross,"Well go up in here. Using that, take advantage of the little curve thats in that brush. And we can just put all kindsa little leaves up here on these. Thinkin about fall, and off we go. See there"
Bob Ross,"A few on the other side, right here on this tree. And its that easy to make a beautiful little, see this does look like autumn to me. Think well call that one finished"
Bob Ross,"And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless my friend. 70s easy listening music"
Bob Ross,"light music horn blowing - Hi, certainly glad you could join us today. Thought today wed just do a fantastic little winter scene thats very easy, and I hope youll enjoy it"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what kind of craziness I got up here today"
Bob Ross,"Today Ive taken our standard old canvas, but Ive taken a piece of contact paper and cut an oval, stuck it on there"
Bob Ross,"And then using gray gesso in the background, Ive just taken a natural sponge with gray gesso on it and just tapped"
Bob Ross,And then an old liner brush with a little gesso and put the indication of a few little sticks and twigs. Thats all there is to it
Bob Ross,"After that was dry, then I took and used the same old sponge with black gesso and just tapped this in. Ive allowed that to completely dry. The gesso is dry"
Bob Ross,"And on top of all of that, then Ive just put a very think coat of liquid clear. Very, very thin coat, just enough to cover it. And now Ill show you how to make a fantastic effect very simply"
Bob Ross,"Lets start with a little white and a little touch of the phthalo blue today. Add a little bit of white to it. And phthalo blue, phthalo blue is such a wonderful, beautiful color"
Bob Ross,"And then well just go up in here and begin painting. Now the phthalo blue is very transparent, white is opaque"
Bob Ross,"But Ive used such a small amount of white, youll still be able to see through it and make out all the little individual things that we put in there just using an old sponge"
Bob Ross,"And when youre looking for a sponge, Id really recommend for this purpose that you use a natural sponge rather than a man-made sponge"
Bob Ross,"Reason being, a natural sponge has just hundreds of irregularities in it. A man-made sponge is very symmetrical, all the holes are the same size. So its not a very interesting shape"
Bob Ross,"There we are, okay, let me wash the old brush. And thats the fun part of this. We wash it, just shake off the paint thinner. banging chuckles And beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,"I usually wipe it across a paper towel. I wanna take some more white and a little bit of alizarin crimson now. I want a little pinkish hue, but very little color on the brush, theres not much"
Bob Ross,"Now maybe right in here well use white and a little crimson, and well just let this little glow happen in here. Maybe a little touch more white right down in here. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Thought today wed just do a painting that is very, very pretty, one thatll make you feel good. Okay. And thats really about all I need. Already it looks misty and soft in there just from doing that"
Bob Ross,"Now then. Take a little white and alizarin crimson again. Just want a little crimson in there. Im gonna tap it to create, see that little ridge of paint right there"
Bob Ross,Theres one just like it on the brush. Right on the corner is what were looking for. Lets go up in here
Bob Ross,And maybe back in here we can begin picking out just the indication of a few little highlights on some of these rascals. We dont want a lot of color here
Bob Ross,"Just enough to show some little happenings on some of these trees in the background. Just that much. Very quickly, you can have too much, so be stingy with it, there. All kinds of little dooders"
Bob Ross,"Without really painting, so it gives the impression that these things are back there and theyre happening. And since theyre just background material, we dont care"
Bob Ross,This is a very simple way of doing it and very effective. There we go. And maybe we just pick out a few little individual bushes that are showing here and there
Bob Ross,And thats really all I want in the background. Very soft colors are very relaxing. Just make you feel good when you look at a painting like this. There we are. Okay
Bob Ross,"Now then, for these dark trees, we can get right into the fun. Im gonna take phthalo blue and alizarin crimson. Proportionately, much more crimson than blue. The blue is many, many times as strong"
Bob Ross,"There we are. But I wanna mix this to the reddish side. You can take it to the blue side or the reddish side. Today, for this part of the painting, I want it to go sorta to the reddish side"
Bob Ross,"All right, wipe off the knife. I have several old brushes going, so well just grab one here. Good, dark color, load a little bit into the bristles in the same exact way as we did before"
Bob Ross,"And lets go up in here and just put us in some nice edges on this dark. We dont need much paint. Just enough to bring us some edges here. There, all kinds of little hangy down doers, there"
Bob Ross,"But see, I just use the corner of the brush, just the corner. And most of this dark is here with the gesso. You really dont have to worry in this part of it"
Bob Ross,"And maybe theres some little individual things that are happening in here. And we just paint in some little basic, very basic little shapes. Just some happy little things that live there"
Bob Ross,"A few on the other side. There. Something about like that. Just sorta think like a tree, and thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Just like when I was a little boy, I wanted to catch a rabbit, and I asked my uncle, How in the world do you catch a rabbit.  He says, Its easy, stand behind a tree, make a noise like a carrot"
Bob Ross,"When the rabbit comes by you, grab him.  I never caught any rabbits. There. Okay. And thats really about all we need right there"
Bob Ross,"Now, going back to my brush that had the pink color, made from alizarin crimson, titanium white. Tell you what, let me get just a little liquid white. The liquid white here is just to thin the color"
Bob Ross,"Just to thin it. All right, be right back, get a little touch of, oh, thats perfect, perfect. All right, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, with this color, we can just go in here and just begin dropping in little indications of things on these little trees, that easy. Maybe a little touch more of the liquid white"
Bob Ross,"If you have trouble making it stick, add a little more of the liquid white. There, see, goes right on now. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"With a very little practice, youll amaze yourself in just a few days at what you can do. Just a few days, it doesnt take long, doesnt take long"
Bob Ross,"All right, see, and thats picking up that color that we put on, and automatically over in here, I want it to get a little darker and darker. There. All right, little more of the liquid white"
Bob Ross,"Once again, liquid whites just to make it thinner cause a thin paint, as you know, will stick to a thick paint, thin to thick. So each layer of paint needs to get a little bit thinner here"
Bob Ross,"All right, and you can do this with a one-inch brush or the two-inch brush, it doesnt matter. It really doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"For the sake of time on TV here, we do it with a two-inch brush most of the time. Just to save time. But some people will find that the one-inch brush will give em a little more control"
Bob Ross,"Its up to you, try em both, see which one works the best, and thats the one you should use, there. About like that. But just think about all the little shapes in here"
Bob Ross,"This would be a perfect little place for my little squirrel Peapod to live. I tell you what, Ive got a little bit of footage right here of Peapod, let me show him to you"
Bob Ross,"That little rascal, he is such a cute little devil. Hes lived with me ever since he was just a tiny little baby. Fact, his eyes wasnt even opened when he came to me"
Bob Ross,"And Ive raised him up, and he now lives in the backyard. I turned him loose quite a while ago. But hes the one little squirrel that doesnt seem to wanna go away, he just hangs around"
Bob Ross,"Every morning he comes to my backdoor and I feed him and take care of him. He runs through the house like he owns it. Which as far as hes concerned, he does own it. And thats all right"
Bob Ross,"Very few people ever have the opportunity to know a little feller like him as well as I do. And hes very special to me, very, very special. Hes messy. Isnt that something"
Bob Ross,I hope you enjoy seeing all these little rascals. Theyre very special in my life. I spend a great deal of my time and resources just devoted to these little characters and taking care of em
Bob Ross,"Ive added a little bit of phthalo blue now to my brush. Gonna change the flavor a little bit. Just a little, something about like that. All right, now then. We can take, put the indication here"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little white, a little dark sienna. And a little paint thinner on the liner brush. And maybe here and there and there and here, you can see the indication of just a few little tree trunks"
Bob Ross,"I dont want many, just enough to give the indication that theres something back here. Your mind will fill in whats left out. There, in painting, you dont have to put in every detail"
Bob Ross,"There you go, just enough to give indications. All right, liner brush is not much fun to clean. It dont splash and raise Cain like the old big two-inch brush, I prefer that big one. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets grab, lets grab, lets grab a fan brush, lets try that. We could do it with anything, but the fan brush happens to be convenient. Load it full of titanium white"
Bob Ross,"And maybe, lets see, maybe up in here, we said this was a winter scene, so we need a little bit of snow, that easy. And it, too, is picking up that color thats on top of the gesso there"
Bob Ross,"And itll make automatic shadows for you. Shoot, I tell you what lets do. Lets take a little touch of our phthalo blue, and Im gonna put it right in here. I just decided, watch"
Bob Ross,"Thats whats so fantastic about this. You see things as they happen, you just begin seeing em. You begin seeing em. I see one right there. There"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then, lets take a little bit of white on the two-inch brush. Watch, see, I put that blue in there. Now watch what happens. See, that easy, isnt that sneaky. That easy"
Bob Ross,"And then we pull across, look at that. See, itll give the impression of a little water right there. And thats all you have to do. I know sometimes I get sorta carried away and get excited"
Bob Ross,"And Ive probably in my life, Ive probably painted somewhere in excess of 30,000 paintings. And I still get excited, its one of the few things in my life that I never get tired of seeing"
Bob Ross,"It just fascinates me. I worked for so many years painting, but painting was hard for me. It was not fun, I worked at it. And then I discovered this, this style of painting"
Bob Ross,"Its easy, anybody can do it. You dont have to go to school half your life to be able to paint. You can do this. Over here, see here, well just put in all kinds of little doers, maybe little"
Bob Ross,"Look at that, you can do this. I get letters every day from people who said, I heard you say that over and over, and I finally got up my nerve and I tried it, and you were right"
Bob Ross,"You really can do this, you really can. You know what, thats such a beautiful, I want a little cabin right here, right here"
Bob Ross,"Im just gonna scrape off some of the excess paint, which there is not much there, so we dont have to worry. Lets build us a happy little cabin"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take some van dyke brown, pull it out very flat, just flat as I can get it, and then cut across and get a little roll of paint. See, it lives right out there on the edge of the knife"
Bob Ross,"Decide where your little cabin lives in your world. And it can be anywhere that you want it. Well start with the back eave, there we are. And well just sort of fill it in here"
Bob Ross,"Were just blocking in color. Really doesnt matter here. Were just blocking it in. There, something about like that. Take a little white, a little dark sienna, mix em together"
Bob Ross,"And I dont wanna over mix these. I wanna leave em marbled, just sorta marbly. Like that, see, all the different things happening"
Bob Ross,"When you pick up that little roll of paint, theyre still in there, all those little things are right there, okay. Now we can take that color and very gently, very, very gently just let it graze"
Bob Ross,"Just let it graze the canvas. Make it look like old boards, old wood. There we are. Something about like that. Boy, that rascals hiding up there in the trees"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets decide where our roof lives. Snow on the roof. And there. This old knife is wonderful for painting things like this. Works so well"
Bob Ross,"Then on the other side of the roof, we need a little snow. Just to bring it all together. Take a little bit of van dyke brown and make this look like old boards cause I like old boards"
Bob Ross,You could make this a log cabin or anything else you want it very easily. Need a door though so the little rascal can get in and out. And well just sorta outline the door so it stands out
Bob Ross,"And that easy, weve got a little door. Do a little cabinectomy. All right. All right. Then put a little snow right back up in here, bring him around. Okay, lets see whats on this side"
Bob Ross,"This side of the cabin, maybe well put a tree that grows right out in here. What the heck. In our world, we can do anything that we wanna do. Fact, maybe, yeah, what the heck"
Bob Ross,"See, you just see these things and you get carried away. Maybe theres a, maybe it comes all the way down. I dont care, it doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"You can do anything that you want in your world any old way that you want. Take a little brown, van dyke brown, dark sienna, a little white. Lets put us in the indication here of a little tree trunk"
Bob Ross,"Well, maybe well have several little sticks and twigs, doesnt matter. Doesnt matter. All right, tell you what, we talked about using a one-inch brush, lets try one"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna dip it into liquid white to thin the paint. Thats the only reason, just to thin the paint. And lets grab a little of that phthalo blue. Just a small amount"
Bob Ross,"There, now, I wanna tap the brush. See, once again, were creating that same little ridge of paint, just like we did with the other brush, with the two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Now then, try this little brush, try the big brush. See which one works the best for you. Once again, I dont wanna tell you that you have to do anything any certain way"
Bob Ross,I just wanna show you possibilities. And you make it work any way that you want to. But the one-inch brush will work just as well to make all these little bushes and trees
Bob Ross,I personally prefer the two-inch brush. It seems to have more hair in it. And its faster. chuckles And I got a mean old director who has no sense of humor if I go over 30 minutes here
Bob Ross,"Absolutely no sense of humor. So well go back to the two-inch. Just wanted to show you how it could be done. There, just a few little highlights on some of these things"
Bob Ross,"These paintings come out looking very, very soft, very delicate. And theyre gorgeous when you hang em in a room. They just brighten up a room, make you feel good. I know, I know, I know"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little titanium white and maybe, maybe theres a little snow right there. See how you could just keep adding things though. Im sorry, I just really get carried away"
Bob Ross,"Ill take a little van dyke and a little dark sienna. Put a little black in it, too. There we are. Now maybe theres a few little fence post right there. A few little fence posts, there they are"
Bob Ross,"Put another one right here. And another one. Okay, one more. There, lets take a little brown and white. Looks like our lights coming from the left here, so well highlight that side. Like that"
Bob Ross,"On the shadow side here, I wanna take a little white and a little prussian blue. Use prussian blue cause its very dark. I wanna make reflected light here. Just a touch, just a touch"
Bob Ross,"There, on the top, maybe, theres a little snow thats just hanging up here. Just a little snow, you could do this with the liquid white and the liner brush, work just as well. Show you a little trick"
Bob Ross,"Well take liquid white, pull it out as flat as we can get it, just really flat. Really flat, and then cut across. Okay, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now you take that liquid white and just let it run right down through here. And that easy, you can paint a happy little fence"
Bob Ross,"Okay, gotta decide how many strands of wire are on your fence, lets have three. Its our world, we can have as many as we want, shoot. We can have as many as we want"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets go back and get a little bit of, maybe well use a little of that prussian blue, its darker. I want it to stand out a little more. Yeah, its beautiful"
Bob Ross,"Put in just some little bushes and things on this side, just a few. All right. Maybe we can just cover up the foot of these little post here and there"
Bob Ross,"Wherever, lets go on the other side of the canvas. Now then, well put a few little dooders that are hanging right off into this snowbank. That easy. Grab the little script liner brush"
Bob Ross,"Let me mix up a little touch of, take a little of that prussian blue, a little crimson. Yeah, here we go, a little white put in there. This nice color, sort of a lavender color to the reddish side"
Bob Ross,"Okay, paint thinner. I wanna thin this paint, very, very thin. In fact, you can see it drip there. Look at there, its that thin, its almost like ink. Very, very thin, then turn the bristles"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then, if youll take this darker color and just go right along here along the edges of these, put a little dark line under there, itll give the impression that theres depth and thickness"
Bob Ross,"in there. And you see how, just like in a seascape where you put a little dark line under the foam. Thats all there is to it. But doesnt that make a radical difference"
Bob Ross,"Yeah, we can take a little of the liquid white, a little titanium white, and Im using a little filbert brush"
Bob Ross,"And we can just pop in an indication here and there of a few little snow-covered stones that live in there. Take any old brush, it doesnt matter. Pull some of it down"
Bob Ross,"Go across to make it look like its reflecting into the water. Once again, with our little liner brush and that same color, put a little line in there"
Bob Ross,It makes it look like theres a little thickness to it I guess is a good word. So it gives it a base to sit on. That easy. All right. Think well put in a couple little sticks and twigs
Bob Ross,"Shoot, well be about ready here. Ill go into some van dyke brown, a little paint thinner, very thin, very thin. Maybe theres a little one here, right there. Lives right there"
Bob Ross,"But just put these wherever you think they should be. They grow every old where, that easy. Maybe back in here in front of the cabin theres some little teeny ones, theyre not too big"
Bob Ross,"A few in there, anywhere you want em. It really doesnt matter. Old sticks and twigs grow everywhere in the woods. There we are, see. Okay, I think were about ready for the magic moment here"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what lets do, lets bring the camera up here. Lets pull the contact paper off and see what we have. Hey, isnt that something. It makes a striking little painting"
Bob Ross,"These little paintings make wonderful gifts, especially around Christmastime and et cetera. Wonderful gifts, people go crazy over em. Im gonna take a little bit of the red, a little paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"And I think this ones about ready for a signature. If we had a little more time here, you could bring this fence right on out, you know, right on out through here, and itd just extend past the oval"
Bob Ross,"But the old clock on the wall says its about time to go for today, so well just sign this one and call it done"
Bob Ross,"All right, and from all of us here, Id like to take this opportunity to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. light music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Thought today wed do just a fantastic little scene I hope youll enjoy"
Bob Ross,"Lets start out and have run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what Ive got done up here today"
Bob Ross,"Have my standard ol pre-stretched, double prime canvas, and Im using an 18x24 inch, but you use any size thats convenient for you"
Bob Ross,"Ive covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of liquid white. The liquid white is still wet. Now, its wet and slick and were ready to go. So lets just have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, lets start with alizarin crimson today, what the heck, on the ol two inch brush. Let us a put in a little pinky area here in the sky"
Bob Ross,"Once again, the sky is covered with liquid white, or the entire canvas is. Cause the alizarin crimson is just mixing with it. So that it gets lighter and lighter in value"
Bob Ross,"If this were a dry canvas, itd be very difficult to put paint on this smooth, this easy. Mmkay, something about like so, I dont want to set the sky on fire"
Bob Ross,"All I want to do is just put a nice warm glow in here. And most of this well cover up, I think. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Now then, while we still have a little brush going, lets go into, a little bit of phthalo blue. Phthalo blue is a very warm blue. Beautiful blue, its my favorite. Kay, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now with the phthalo blue, were going to make little Xs, little crisscross strokes. Just little Xs, da ta da ta da. That easy, that easy, there we are. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Well come back and blend when we have a clean brush. Just bring it down to the crimson and stop. Itll cover up the crimson, eat it all up"
Bob Ross,"So just stop right at it, then well blend it together later. Shoot, while weve got that going there, lets put a little more of the blue on the brush. Load it just exactly the same way"
Bob Ross,"Im going to reach here and get a little touch of phthalo green. Dont need much, phthalo green is very strong. Beautiful color though. Lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe well have a little water in here, what the heck. Just pull from the outside in. Outside in, like so. Mkay, little more paint on the brush. Do the same thing to the other side"
Bob Ross,"Im intentionally leaving a little area open here, so itll look like a little sheen of light coming across the water when were finished. All right, now then, tell you what, lets wash the ol brush"
Bob Ross,"Thats the fun part. Thats the fun part, thats where I get even with everybody here, washing the brush. Shake off excess. light beating thumps I just beat the devil outta it. That really is fun"
Bob Ross,"Theres such a thing as a little brush beater rag. So when youre doing this at home, you dont cover the entire living room or wherever you happen to be painting"
Bob Ross,"If you do what Im doing with a brush at home, you can certainly end a happy relationship. Be very careful. Now with a good, dry, clean brush, we can just blend those colors together"
Bob Ross,"To where we cant tell where one color stops and the next color starts. There we are. And you can make it as smooth as you want. Down here, same basic thing. Always want to smooth it out"
Bob Ross,"Now, Im going to go totally across. But see that little light area will still be in there. Its not as distinct as it was, but its still there and we dont want it to be real distinct"
Bob Ross,We just want it to have a nice little sheen of light coming across the water when everythings finished. All right. Now then. Lets use one of these little oval brushes
Bob Ross,"Im going to go into a little bit of white. I said oval, but I meant round brush, this is a small, round brush"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes my tongue gets over my eyeteeth and I cant see what Im saying, but this is just a little round brush. And lets play with it today"
Bob Ross,"Maybe back in our world here, theres just a little mountain that lives right there. And we can use this brush to just put in a little indication"
Bob Ross,"You can paint entire paintings with these round brushes, theres a big one and a small one. There we are. Now, get the ol two inch brush, and well pull it and blend it"
Bob Ross,"So that its bottom just disappears. I want it to just set there, very quietly. Very, very quietly, very distant. See, now we just have that little pinkish glow around the top"
Bob Ross,"And thats all were looking for. Lets take, well use some phthalo blue, some alizarin crimson, a little white. Lets make sort of a lavender color. Shoot, I like that, looks good"
Bob Ross,"Well just work with what we have here. Take a little of that, on the same little brush, I didnt clean the brush, just like it was. Lets go up in here, and maybe, maybe, yep"
Bob Ross,"Right along in here, well just put the indication of another little hill and bump. Instead of hills and dales, weve got hills and bumps. There. Maybe, right on out, I dont know. Doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Absolutely doesnt matter. If youll make it look like theres little trees, lift upward, itll look like youre covered. Like some of the hills in North Carolina and Missouri, ah, beautiful places"
Bob Ross,"In fact Im gonna be in Missouri pretty soon. Were going to be in Branson, Missouri doing the show. So if get a chance and youre in that area, stop by and say hello, Id love to talk to you"
Bob Ross,"See what youre doing. There, now okay. Now then, see. We have two ranges of hills already. Now then, lets go a little further. Take a little Prussian blue. Prussian blue is much stronger, darker"
Bob Ross,"A little more crimson. I want this to get darker. As things get closer to you in a landscape, they should get darker and darker in value. Alright, lets go up in here. Decision time"
Bob Ross,"Alright, see here, maybe. There it is. You just decide, in your world you can have things anywhere that you want em. Anywhere that you want em. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Alright, maybe it goes right on out there somewhere. Doesnt matter. Absolutely doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"And since we had trees on that one, maybe this one here should have the indication of little distant trees. There, see, its that easy. Little short strokes though when youre doing this"
Bob Ross,"Dont get greedy. I know it gets feeling good and you want it all at once. But take your time, little strokes, work in layers. Work in layers, just keep working down, down, down"
Bob Ross,"See that, it makes it look like theres tiny little trees growing back there. I want to create some mist, down at the base. I like these misty areas. So well just tap, firmly tap"
Bob Ross,"Thats mixing with the liquid white thats on the canvas. And automatically, youll get the impression of mist. Very, very, easy. Very easy. Very soft, mmm"
Bob Ross,"And you could just keep going here, it doesnt matter. Lets see, add a little black to that, well get it darker. Well have a lot of little footy hills in this one. Much darker"
Bob Ross,"Fact, this ones almost, pure dark, but not quite. Just a little white in there. And maybe, lets just start up in here. Theres a bump, see there. Just let your imagination go"
Bob Ross,"Absolutely let your imagination go, wherever you want it to take you. There. I just wanted to use this small round brush just to show you what the fantastic things itll do"
Bob Ross,"Cause its unbelievable what you can do with it if youll just practice a little. Just make friends with it. All of these tools, you have to make friends with. Now, weve got some dark color in there"
Bob Ross,"Look at all the distance in this painting though, already. Just in that background, looks like you could walk back in there forever"
Bob Ross,"And you know theres a ton of little streams and waterfalls and all kinds of things happening on those little mountains. light beating thumps Alright. Now, well just continue to use that same brush"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take, a little bit of green, little bit of yellow, little sap green right there. Alright, little yellow ochre, Indian yellow, once in awhile, Ill hit bright red. But tap it, see"
Bob Ross,"Mkay, lets go up in here. Now then, with that color, we can just begin creating the illusion of grass on some of these little things. Just little hilly areas"
Bob Ross,"Now you could do this with a two inch brush and its much, much quicker. I just want to show you that you can use this brush to do these things. Its much, much faster with a bigger brush"
Bob Ross,"This might give you a little more detail. Get into the yellow ochres here, I see a little touch of the red now and then. There, well just let all these little things happen"
Bob Ross,"Goes right up, we dont care. Wherever you want it. Wherever. If you have trouble making it stick, add the least little touch of paint thinner. Least little touch, not much"
Bob Ross,"Not much, doesnt take much. You can always add a little more. Its a son of a gun trying to get rid of it though. There. Just a little. And were just tapping, just tapping"
Bob Ross,"See, then we get a little more of the yellow ochre here, maybe, oh I dont know. You could put all kinds of little dooders, wherever, wherever"
Bob Ross,"Now with the two inch brush wed probably already been finished with this. But this is more fun. There. But see, its already beginning to look like little hills in the back here"
Bob Ross,Maybe Jack Frost is playing his way through. Autumns beginning to come. The colors are turning. Some of the little birds are flying south for the winter
Bob Ross,"I live in Florida, so the little birds come to see me during the winter. There we are. Alright, this areas Ive showed you Peapod, my little pocket squirrel a whole bunch of times. Hes my friend"
Bob Ross,"Mkay, a little touch here, you decide. Maybe theres another little dooder here. You put as many of these in as you want. You can create these illusions anywhere that you want"
Bob Ross,"Anywhere that you want, put a little dark right there. There we are. See. But look at the distance in that already. Theres one, two, three, four, five, six planes. Six planes in there"
Bob Ross,"Now, I know youre not interested in selling paintings, and making all that money, but if you should be, these little planes, show distance in painting. And theyre what make paintings sell"
Bob Ross,"People like that, to be able to look into a painting and just see forever. And its very simple. Very, very simple, you can do it. You can do it. Alright. There we are. Something like so. Mkay"
Bob Ross,"And you can also take and put a little titanium white on the brush, or even a little liquid white, thats a little too stiff. Well use liquid white"
Bob Ross,"You can pick out a few areas and really sparkle them. Dont do too many though. If you do too many, itll lose the effectiveness of it. Just here and there. Just here and there"
Bob Ross,"Alright, Im gonna wash the ol brush. This little round brush is not as much fun as a two inch brush to wash and beat. light beating thumps But its not bad. Its not bad"
Bob Ross,"Lets mix up a big ol pile of color here and have some fun. Take some Prussian blue, black, well put some phthalo green in it, brown, doesnt matter, crimson, just all the dark colors. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now there are many, many ways to paint bushes and stuff. I want to show you one thats very simple. If youve never painted, and youre afraid to try because you say its too difficult, watch this"
Bob Ross,"Well take this little round brush. And Im going to load a lot of paint in it, just a lot of paint. You need a pile of paint to work out of, dont be stingy with paint here. A lot of paint"
Bob Ross,"Now Im gonna figure out, maybe well have a little, maybe well have some water down here. Maybe theres some little weeds that grow back in here. Looky there, see how easy that is"
Bob Ross,"All you gotta do us take and tap it. Just tap it. Its like, playing the war drum here. My father was a Cherokee Indian, so I can play the war drum here. But see that. Isnt that fantastic"
Bob Ross,"Anybody can paint. There are no big secrets to it, we give them all to you here. Give you all the secrets. If you want a reflection, decide where you want it, pull straight down, thats all"
Bob Ross,"Thats all. Its a little easier with a two inch brush cause weve got a little more hair to work with. We just pull it straight down. Like that, then very gently, go across"
Bob Ross,"And you have instant reflections, that easy. That easy. Now, you want to put some highlights on those. Well do it the same way"
Bob Ross,"Now Im not going to load it as deep, notice that its not as deep as the dark color is. I just went through the yellow, because it has blue on there, youll get instant green. Alright, now"
Bob Ross,"Wherever you want a little highlight, all you do is touch. I want to leave these dark so theyll stand out. But thats all youre gonna do"
Bob Ross,"A few right in here, I dont want too many cause I want this to stay dark. Well do this in the foreground and Ill show you how to put more highlight, kay. But thats about all we need there"
Bob Ross,"A little touch of the liquid white. Maybe a little more. Little more, put a little, ooh, put a little blue in there. Just a small amount to change the flavor"
Bob Ross,"And well come right up in here and lets make the indication of a little water line. I dont want one thats very distinct, just an indication"
Bob Ross,"If you put one in here thats too bright, too much paint, all you gotta do is rub it. And itll just be absorbed right into there, right into whats there. Thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Now, lets do that again. Back to deep loading the brush. Lot of paint, lot of paint, once again. You need a pile of paint if you want to do this"
Bob Ross,"You can really load the brushs bristles thick with paint. Now all you do is just tap. This is so easy, its almost unbelievable. If youve never painted, I believe you can do this"
Bob Ross,"I really believe you can do this painting, its that simple. There. Something about like that. Cause thats one of the things we do. We travel around and teach people to paint"
Bob Ross,Who honestly dont think they have any talent or they say they never could
Bob Ross,"Recently we were on the Phil Donahue show, they picked us out some five people out of the audience and said they absolutely could not paint"
Bob Ross,"They had no talent, no experience and knew they couldnt do it. We worked with them for just over two hours. And if you saw the show, they produced beautiful paintings"
Bob Ross,"I was as proud as an old mother hen. And Phil, himself, he just took a video tape home and painted with it. Shoot, he didnt even need instructions"
Bob Ross,"But I think hes good at everything he tries, if youll know the truth. Im gonna go back, get a little more of that color. Once again, notice I havent loaded it as deep as I did the dark"
Bob Ross,"Cause I just want these highlights to be more on the top. Mkay, lets try this. Sometimes you have to think the paint a little to make it come off. There, see. Looks just like ol swamp grass"
Bob Ross,"Then just work with individual little clumps. If ones too bright, just continue to tap it. That dark color will absorb it, and itll go away and leave ya. Just go away and leave ya. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Add a little touch of paint thinner to my paint. See, then it comes off so much easier. Just have to barely hit it. There. Which you can make beautiful effects. Beautiful effects just doing this"
Bob Ross,"You can even take, touch it this way, give it a little upward push if you want to make little small grassy areas. See there. Thats all. Thats really all there is to it. There we are. Mmkay"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we can once again, a little reflection here and there. There. Little touch of our liquid white on the knife. Come right in like that. Well put us a little happy water line right in there"
Bob Ross,"Doesnt matter. Doesnt matter. Something about like so. There. Now then, lets do the same thing over here, put some grassy areas. Thats working so well, I like it, thats fun. That is fun"
Bob Ross,"Where do we want this one, right there. Well just tap in all kinds of little dooders. There. See there, you just decide where the reflection is. Just invite it up to the reflection"
Bob Ross,"Thats all there is to it. Put a little color, and Im going to grab the two inch brush just because its a little faster"
Bob Ross,"You really could do just about this entire painting with nothing but this small brush. Alright. Little paint thinner, then Im going to go through the greens again. Just so we can highlight"
Bob Ross,"And well put in just a few little dooders like that. Not many, not too many. Dont kill all your dark area. There we are. Now, I know, I know, watch here. Let me find the ol fan brush"
Bob Ross,"I see something. Well put some more dark color in there, Im running outta color. Same colors. Load the ol brush full of paint, lot of paint, both sides. Alright. Maybe, right there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world there live, just a little evergreen tree. They live right here in your fan brush, just sorta scare em out. Alright, well give him a friend. See there, just like that"
Bob Ross,"Just like that. If there was two there, sooner or later thered be three. You know how them trees are. There"
Bob Ross,"I want to take that color, leave it right on the fan brush, go right through little bit of yellow, and thatll give us instant, green dry highlights"
Bob Ross,"Dont want a lot of highlights, just enough to make em stand out a little. And thats really about all we want. Thats really about all we want. Add a little water"
Bob Ross,"I know, lets get crazy, we got a minute or so left here. Back to more brushes. Got all that dark, dark color. Sometimes, I told you wed get crazy here. Sometimes its fun"
Bob Ross,"I know, well just let this go. There it is. See there. But dont be afraid to try things, shoot. Take a chance sometime, in painting you can take all the chances you want. Go out on a limb"
Bob Ross,"Go out on a limb once in awhile, take a chance. Shoot, I learned a long time ago thats where the fruit grows, out on the end of a limb. All the good things are there"
Bob Ross,"Take chance, dont be afraid of it. Especially in painting, youre not gonna hurt anything. There. All the little grassy areas, see em. That easy. Leave some dark in there though. Vary your colors"
Bob Ross,"Just a little. But leave some of those dark holes in there. And you can figure out where all your little water lines are back here. Shoot, have to make all these decisions. Where do they live. Maybe"
Bob Ross,Just little things in there. This looks like some of the swamps in Florida almost. But we dont have these kind of foothills. But this would be a beautiful way of making little swamp scenes. Mmkay
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take my little script liner brush, a little dark sienna, a little van dyke brown just mixed together here on the brush. A lot of paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"A lot of paint thinner, maybe my little black too, I want it dark. Alright. Maybe in our world. Shoot, you know me. Now this isnt gonna be that big a tree"
Bob Ross,"I know, you think Im gonna put a huge tree in there. Im just gonna put a junior sized tree. Just like so"
Bob Ross,"If you have trouble making the paint flow, add paint thinner to your brush, thats all there is to it. If its thin enough, itll slide right over here. Maybe this ol tree is dead"
Bob Ross,"I hate it, but it happens. There. So just put as many arms as you think are remaining on him. Just as many as you think are remaining. Well give him a little friend right here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe its the same tree, both of em. Maybe both of em pooped out. Tell you what, lets sign this little devil and call it finished. Take a little red and well sign it"
Bob Ross,I really hope youve enjoyed this little painting. Its one of the most simple paintings youll ever come across. And you can do it
Bob Ross,"From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, God bless my friend. peaceful music"
Bob Ross,"- Hi and welcome back. Certainly glad to see you today. I thought today wed do the little painting that you see at the beginning of this show, the little animated opening"
Bob Ross,"Ill show you step by step how that one was made. Now it will not be an exact duplicate of the painting that you see on the opening, but itll show you exactly how it was made"
Bob Ross,Lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that. as usual let me show you what Ive got up here
Bob Ross,"Ive got an 18 by 24 inch pre-stretched double prime canvas, and Ive covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of liquid white. So its wet and slick and all ready to go"
Bob Ross,"So, lets just take old two inch brush and start off here and have a little fun"
Bob Ross,"Ill start with a little touch of the bright red, a little yellow orche, maybe a little cadmium yellow all mixed together. Something like so. Not a lot of paint, just a little"
Bob Ross,And lets go up in here and very lightly just put in a quick little sky. The little sky in that was sort of a sort of a orangey yellowish color. Just a very nice color
Bob Ross,Put it on a little darker than you want it. It will mix with the liquid white thats already on the canvas and get lighter and lighter as you work down
Bob Ross,"And thats really about all there was to making the sky in that little painting. Just something like so. There we are. Couldnt be any simpler could it. All there is. Okay, now then"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets have some fun. Today Im going to make a big pile of brown, using sap green and alizarin crimson in about equal parts. About equal parts, the two together make a gorgeous, gorgeous brown"
Bob Ross,"Gorgeous brown. One of our instructors, Audrey Golden, who lives in Florida, calls it Christmas brown because you use red and green. Thats a good analogy. There we are. Okay. Now then"
Bob Ross,"Wipe off the old knife. Basically, all we did here to make all the little background trees, Im just using the same old dirty brush, it doesnt matter. Tap in a little bit of color, this brown color"
Bob Ross,"Right into the bristles. And you just decide basically, where you want to start and off you go. Maybe theres a little happy tree, lives right there"
Bob Ross,"And all were looking for is just very, very basic shapes. Were not looking for a lot of detail. Not a lot of detail. This is background trees. We had a little covered bridge in there"
Bob Ross,"So this is just background material for the little bridge. There, little openings neat isnt it. The title comes out of there sounds like an old car"
Bob Ross,"Thats another invention of my good friend here, Jerry Morton, whos one of the engineers"
Bob Ross,"Jerry comes up with these ideas for the opening and dont know where he gets them, but I really enjoy working with him"
Bob Ross,"Hes like the rest of us, hes about half crazy, and thats what it takes to work here and to do this. Youll see that quick, we just put in a little background. Just a little background. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now then. You sort of have to decide at this point, where the water is going to be. Theres a little bit of water here where the bridge goes across. We dont see a great deal of it, but a little"
Bob Ross,So you bring these trees down to basically where you want water to be. Alright. Lets say were getting pretty close right about there
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets take our liner brush, old number two script liner, and well take a little but of that same brown color that we made from the crimson and the sap green, mix the paint here with paint"
Bob Ross,"And then well go up here, and you just sort of look around and pick out places you think thered be little trunks and stems and limbs and all those things peapod and all my little friends play on out"
Bob Ross,"here. There, just put in a few little indications. Where ever, where ever. Its up to you. Totally and completely up to you"
Bob Ross,"There, old tree needs some arms to hold up all these leaves that it has here. There. Okay, thats all theres to it. If you have trouble making the paint slight, add a little more paint thinner"
Bob Ross,"If you have enough paint thinner itll slide right over the top of that thicker paint. Very, very easy. Okay. Shoot, old brush is working pretty good. Well go right on back to him"
Bob Ross,"Im going to take that same brush and begin tapping it into the yellows and the red. The bright red. And just go around, try them all"
Bob Ross,That way youre loading all kinds of different colors right into the bristles of the brush. Okay now. Lets just sort of test it. See if its bright enough. Its the color were looking for
Bob Ross,Maybe Ill add a little more yellow. There we go. Something about like so. And then with that we can start. Ill put a little touch of liquid white in there. Im going to thin it down a little more
Bob Ross,"There we are. That sticks very easy. Thin paint will stick to a thick paint, always remember that. And theres one, maybe Jack Frost has touched this one. Its up to you, you decide"
Bob Ross,"These are just using little colors and just the two inch brush and just tapping on it. Just tapping it. Thats all there is to it. Alright, maybe, why not. There"
Bob Ross,Isnt that a neat way of making just little background trees. Its good when youre not looking for a lot of detail
Bob Ross,"Youre looking for more detail, then you get into different ways of making them, but here we dont want detail, itll ruin the illusion of distance if you have too much detail"
Bob Ross,"Little sap green every so often. Maybe theres a little one, yup, right there. Little one right there that Jack Frost didnt hit yet. Hell get him. That rascals sneaky, boy"
Bob Ross,"He gets them all sooner or later. There. Okay. Now. Yup, this little devil right here. He needs something too. Okay. Little bit of the red"
Bob Ross,"And you decide, you have to make these big decisions where all these things live. You decide. You can make many, many, many layers though. That easy. That easy. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Ive got several old two inch brushes going. Lets take, well take a little black and add it to that brown. I want a darker color, stronger color, and just tap a little right into the brush"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right in here, well put a few little trees and bushes. Theyre a little closer, little darker. Just to help push everything back, create that illusion of distance. There we just let it fade off"
Bob Ross,We dont care where they go over there. Thats that same brown color with midnight black in it. There we are. I like that color. Lets get crazy here. Well take a little more of that
Bob Ross,"Were going to have water in this painting that the bridge covers up. Well take that same color black and that brown we made and just pull it straight down. Straight down, straight down"
Bob Ross,Its important that it does straight down. There. We dont care where it goes here. Dont worry about it. Dont worry about it
Bob Ross,"Because as you know, we dont make mistakes, we just have happy accidents in our world. See there. A little bit over here. Where ever you think it should be"
Bob Ross,"There, darken that a little bit right in there. And just pull it straight down"
Bob Ross,"I know you get tired of hearing me say that over and over, but if you make these lines go at an angle, your reflections just absolutely will not look right. Then well go across"
Bob Ross,"Thats really about all were going to do. Most of this were going to cover up, but it will give the impression of a little bit of water back here. Just a small amount, thats all were looking for"
Bob Ross,"Now we can take our knife, little bit of white, little van dyke brown, dark sienna, mixed together. Little more white in there. There, I want marbled"
Bob Ross,"Maybe even put a little black in there too to gray it. Very good, I like that right there. Little roll of paint. Little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,You just sort of play around with the color until you find what youre looking for. Just going to put the indication here and there. Few little things that live right out here. The waters edge
Bob Ross,"Just a little soil. Something about mumbles. And we can take a little yellow ochre, a little touch of white. Just enough to tint that a little. mumbles mumbles Just enough to tint. There"
Bob Ross,"A lighter color. Sometimes you can take a fan brush, put a little touch of light color, a little white on it and lift up. Just to blend that together"
Bob Ross,"So that it all comes together, looks like a nice little area right along there. See. Right at the waters edge. Sneaky huh. And its a very simple. Very simple. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now take a knife and a little touch of liquid white, Im going to put a little, little but of blue in it. Little bit of prussian blue in it. Just enough to tint it and cut across, Just like so"
Bob Ross,Then we can go up in here. Put the blue in there just to dull that a little bit. I dont want it bright white. Dont want it too bright
Bob Ross,"In this particular painting, a real bright borderline to me, wouldnt look right, but if you want one, you put it in where ever you want it. At any shade, any value, any color you want"
Bob Ross,"Paintings very individual. Everybody should paint what they see and what they feel. Okay, you ready"
Bob Ross,"Now we have to decide where in our world here that our little covered bridge lives, put a few little sticks somewhere in that bush. It just looked like it needed one"
Bob Ross,"Now, if our bridge is right here, lets decide, right in here, probably one of the easiest ways. Well, well see"
Bob Ross,"Theres not much paint on there, but I was trying to scrape off the paint so you could see. Ill use a little color. Let me put a little color on there. Its just sort of to lay out the basic idea"
Bob Ross,"See. Its all there is. Okay. Now try this, I know sometimes these little building is sort of hard to do. Does that make sense. Just lay out the basic shape of the building. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Lets take a little of that brown we made. Okay. Now heres our bridge. Just like building a cabin. Only its got a huge door in front of, using a little van dyke brown here and there"
Bob Ross,"I want a darker brown. There we go. There we go, there we go. Lets put some up here on the roof. There. And over in here. Look at that. Thats all there is to it. Now"
Bob Ross,"Lets make us up some highlight color. Well use from brown and some white. Some yellow, maybe even a little red here and there. There. Little dark sienna. Thats getting better"
Bob Ross,"A little bit more of the brown. Yes, yes. See it just gets feeling good and you know you got it right. I get our little roll of paint, always that little roll of paint"
Bob Ross,"And lets begin picking out little individual things in here. See, we can just, maybe theres some little boards. There they are. Just little dooders like that. Little bit of our van dyke brown. There"
Bob Ross,Okay now at the top of this some of the old covered bridges had a little area that was open. So the air could get through I guess. Thats all we got to do to put that in there. Now
Bob Ross,"Up here in the front, Im going to make that a little lighter. Thats better, I like that better already. I can tell looking at it on the knife. Ill just do the same basic thing"
Bob Ross,"See, just let that color mix with whats on there already. Dont worry about the door, well go back and get it. Well come back and put a little door right on there. No big deal. There we are. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Something about like that. Now Im going to very gently, just enough to pull the paint a little bit, move it just enough, like it. Just that much, its all were looking for"
Bob Ross,A little bit of the van dyke brown and we go back in here and darken up these areas. There you are. You can also wait til this paint dries and go back in there and put all kinds of details in it
Bob Ross,"You can use glazes and stuff when it dries. By a glaze, I mean you just take a little linseed oil and paint thinner, mix it with a color, transparent color and wash right over it"
Bob Ross,"Putting a little touch of white in there, just to brighten it here and there. So it shows up. Okay. This old bridge looks like me, its about to fall down. Alright, now. Decide where the entrance is"
Bob Ross,"Use a little van dyke. See there, thats all there is to it. Thats all there is too it. That easy. Alright. Something about like so"
Bob Ross,"Now for the top, lets take a little white, Im going to find a place to work here, Ive about used up all my area. Take a little white, little bit of midnight black, I want to make a gray color"
Bob Ross,"Just black and white. Leave it marbled. Little roll of paint. And lets just go down here, and just here and there, let it graze. Just let it graze. Something over here, like so"
Bob Ross,Why that old bridge looks like its seen its better day. Hadnt it. There we are. Now we can just come in here. You want to make it look like you can see back in there
Bob Ross,"So just by changing the angle of the paint, you can do that. See, now you can see, right back in that bridge"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little liquid white, maybe over in here we can see the indication of a few little rails and stuff that go back into the distance"
Bob Ross,"The little road that goes through, it goes back in those woods there. We dont know where it goes. You could take a small knife, little bit of black"
Bob Ross,"Put the indication of a few little stones and stuff out here that this is sitting on. Just do a cabin-ectomy. Anything that you dont want, you turn into part of the reflection thats underneath"
Bob Ross,"See, smooth it right out. That easy. Thats just the reflection. Alright. Lets have some fun. Well grab this brush, its quicker. Now then, we need some soil, some dirt for it to sit on"
Bob Ross,I think we had something about like this. About like that. Well just put this in with brown and a little black in it
Bob Ross,Its that brown we made with the alizarth crimson and the sap green and a little midnight black. Thats all were using. There
Bob Ross,"In my other early, early series, we did a covered bridge that you could see all the way through and see the trees and stuff on the other side"
Bob Ross,"Thats a little more difficult, but its a lot more fun to do. It is a challenge. There we go. All were doing here is just blocking in the color"
Bob Ross,"As I mentioned earlier, theres not much of that water going to show. Most of its going away. Most of it has gone away. There. Okay, had a little bush right there"
Bob Ross,"There we are, just a little bush, lives right here by the water. Thatd be a nice view you can see all the cars come through. There"
Bob Ross,"We filmed a show in Muncie, Indiana, and in this area, theres a lot of covered bridges left. Some of them are absolutely gorgeous"
Bob Ross,"A little town called Matthews, they have a covered bridge festival every year that Ive painted at several times. Very nice town, wonderful people. Alright. Now, lets go back to our little brush"
Bob Ross,Had some of the colors on it. And well go into all the yellows and the reds and here and there a little bit of green. Mix color on your brush though. That way its not dead
Bob Ross,"Theres a lot of things happening right here on your brush. Okay, lets go up in here. Now then decide where all these little dooders live. And we just start laying them in here"
Bob Ross,"Just thinking about the lay of the land. Alright. I want to take a little it of white, little brown, little black to make it gray. Lets start. Lets start bringing that out. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Little more of the brown and white here. Didnt mix up enough. Have to sort of figure out where the roads at that comes out of here. There we are, see that. Its that easy"
Bob Ross,Whole roads just coming towards you. Let it get bigger and bigger as it comes towards you. Thats all there is too it
Bob Ross,"Barely touching, its like putting snow on the mountain, no pressure, absolutely no pressure. Save the pressure for later. Alright"
Bob Ross,"We go back to our little, Im going to put a little touch of liquid white. Just a little touch to thin the paint, make it a little brighter. Little green, all the yellows, little red here and there"
Bob Ross,Nice color. Now then we can go in here and just begin tapping in little grassy things. See there how easy that is. Nothing to it
Bob Ross,"But think about the lay of the land, how you want the land to actually flow here. How you want it to flow. There we are. Alright. And off you go. Just make layers and layers and layers"
Bob Ross,"Isnt that neat. You can do that. This little, little bush right here, he needs some good mumbles too. See. Thats all you need. Just to make him stand out as an individual. There"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little recessed area right in there. See that little bush now has his own home. You dont have to be crazy to do this, but it helps"
Bob Ross,"With a little practice though, youll begin to, youll begin to see things in your painting. Youll see fantastic things in your world. Look at them. Just look. Pay attention to nature"
Bob Ross,"Nature is so fantastic. Start when youre out driving around, look at trees, look at bushes and stuff. Look at how they have form and shape and color. Thats when it gets wonderful"
Bob Ross,"I get letters from fantastic people everyday, all over the world. And they tell me that all of a sudden theyre beginning to see nature. There"
Bob Ross,"That theyve looked at if for many, many years but they didnt really see it til they started painting and I guarantee you. If you paint, you will find a whole new treasure. Maybe right in your yard"
Bob Ross,Brighten that a little bit. Lets take a little brown and white. Just tap in some nice edges on the doorway here. You can get crazy and put windows in here
Bob Ross,"Some of these old covered bridges have windows in them. Its just, its up to you. You can do all kinds of things in yours. Really and surely up to you"
Bob Ross,I think were about got this one to where you can see exactly how the little opening was made. There
Bob Ross,"As I mention over and over on the shows, if you have time to take a picture of what youre doing send it to us. Wed love to see it here at the station. Drop us a line"
Bob Ross,You can drop it to the address on the end of the show. Theyll send it to me. Id love to see it. What youre doing and what kind of success youre having. It really makes it all worthwhile
Bob Ross,"Put a few little sticks and things in here. Basically I think we about have a finished painting. Take a little paint thinner, put a little red. Lets sign this rascal. Well call it done"
Bob Ross,"Hope youve enjoyed seeing how the little opening was made and I hope you give it a try. And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting. God bless my friend. easy rock music"
Bob Ross,- laughs Welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today wed do a painting that we use some black gesso on. I believe youre gonna enjoy this one
Bob Ross,"Lets start out, and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theyre doing that, let me show you what I got done up here today"
Bob Ross,"I have my standard old canvas up here, but today Ive taken a piece of contact paper and cut an oval out of it, stuck it on the canvas, and then painted in inside with black gesso"
Bob Ross,"So we have a good dark surface. On top of the black gesso, Ive covered it with a very thin coat of Liquid Clear. Very thin coat, takes very very little. And with that, shoot, well just have some fun"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take, lets mix up a couple little colors here. Well take some Phthalo Blue, and some Alizarin Crimson. Proportionally, much, much more crimson. Now, put a little white out here, like so"
Bob Ross,"And Im gonna make several different values of this. Thought today wed do a painting that, shoot, you wont even believe its on a black canvas when you get done"
Bob Ross,"Over here, Im gonna go a little bit more to the blue side. There, well just mix up several little values, so we can just pick and play there. However we want to do it. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Maybe just a touch more white in that one. There, okay. Now then, lets just sort of decide where we want some of these things here"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little bit of color, and it didnt take much color when youre working on a black canvas. Doesnt take very much. Well just begin, just dropping in all kinds of little things like this"
Bob Ross,"There we are. See there. Okay, maybe some of that lavendary color, Im just gonna pop them here and there. Wherever, wherever. There we are. But isnt that a neat little way"
Bob Ross,"That black canvas, color just shows up so beautiful on it. So beautiful, theres a little Phthalo Blue and white. Look how that just jumps right out at ya"
Bob Ross,"As I say, when this is done, if everything works just right, its hard to tell this is on a black canvas. I like to paint on dark surfaces, they make some of the most gorgeous effects youve ever seen"
Bob Ross,"There, okay. Something about like that. Look how that blue jumps on ya. Just jumps right up there. Hmm, and you can make this as light and as bright as you want"
Bob Ross,"Its very simple, cause color, once again, on a black canvas, it just sort of jumps out at ya. Just sort of jumps out at ya. There we go"
Bob Ross,"Little bit more of the white, and we can just sort of play these colors around. Its just Titanium White, its all Im using there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe up in here, lets just take Im gonna grab another brush, I have several of them going. Take a little white, and just put it down here, a little bit of Yellow Ochre in it"
Bob Ross,"Just a little Yellow Ochre, so we have white and Yellow Ochre. And maybe, lets just make a decision, maybe right up in here is a little bit of light"
Bob Ross,"Just playing through here, and using just the corner of the brush, and Im just sort of spinning it around. Just sings spin it around, let it go, let it play in here. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Alright. Okay, now Im gonna grab a very soft brush. This is our blender brush. Cause now I wanna begin blending all this together. Very soft brush, tender as a mothers love, as my father used to say"
Bob Ross,"Very, very soft, very gentle. Okay. And with that, we can just begin putting in the indication of all kinds of little shapes and forms that happen out here"
Bob Ross,"Just sort of let them happen, dont worry about em. There. You can even give the impression that theres a little light zinging through there. Just by doing that"
Bob Ross,"Maybe another little do-er lives here. These are wonderful skies to do. Practice with em, play with em. Change the colors, you can use a multitude of colors in here and just wonderful things. Mmm"
Bob Ross,"See, there we go. Wherever you think they should be, thats exactly where they should be. Sometimes you can, if you want to, you can just tap"
Bob Ross,"Take that little soft brush, and just tap in a little Titanium White, and then very gently, very gently, just blend it"
Bob Ross,"Its that easy, when you have a brush thats this gentle, you can paint right over paint without any problem. Without any problem at all"
Bob Ross,"Alright, want that to be just a little brighter, so Ill add a little more white and work from there. There, tiny little circles. Just blending it and then very lightly go over it. Mmm"
Bob Ross,"Maybe down in here, a little bit of that color. Just zinging through the clouds. Alright"
Bob Ross,"You just put it wherever you want it, and maybe, maybe right in here Ill touch a touch of the Alizarin Crimson just to warm it up. Maybe over heres a warm spot. There"
Bob Ross,"See how you can change the flavor. When you do this at home, and give it as a gift or, or even sell it if youre interested in that happy buck. These kind of little things just are wonderful"
Bob Ross,"People enjoy em so much, cause they have a lot of color in em, and theyre unique, theyre different. Theyre just not the standard old painting that you see. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now you can play with this as long as you want to create any effect that you desire. Any effect that you desire. Okay, now then. What are we gonna do down here on the bottom"
Bob Ross,"Thats about all Im gonna do on top. Im gonna take Alizarin Crimson and Sap Green, in about equal parts. In about equal parts"
Bob Ross,"And with that, Im gonna mix it together, to make a gorgeous brown color. Alizarin and Sap. There we go. Okay, let me clean the old brush off, the old knife off. And well just take a two inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Now the bottom of this, I just want to cover with this beautiful brown color. Just gonna cover it. Right over. Something like that. Now maybe when we get up in here, well turn the brush and start"
Bob Ross,"Start using the top corner and lets begin finding little individual shapes that live in here. There we are. See, we just let them come right on up and play in here. Wherever you think they should be"
Bob Ross,These will end up being little trees and bushes that live far back in the background. Just using the top corner of the two inch brush. Its all you need
Bob Ross,"This old two inch brush will do wonderful things for you. Now if this old brush ever bothers you because of its size, you can do everything Im doing here with a one inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Its just a little slower, but itll certainly work. Itll work. There. And we dont put restrictions on you. We just want to teach you a technique, and turn you loose on the world"
Bob Ross,"You do it any way that you want, cause painting should be free. Should be free. Each person sees nature through different eyes. And thats what you should paint"
Bob Ross,My tree just keeps getting taller and taller doesnt it. Thats okay. There. Something about like so. Im gonna take my old script liner brush. A little paint thinner
Bob Ross,"Quite a bit of paint thinner, I wanna make some little tree trunks and limbs and sticks and twigs that live in there. So thin the paint til its, look at there, its almost running. It does run"
Bob Ross,"Turn the bristles, just turn em in there. Loads it full of paint, bring it to a nice sharp point. Lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now, in our little tree up here, were gonna have a few little limbs and sticks and twigs. You decide where they are. We dont even know how manys in there. Dont know that we care right now"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna put leaves on these trees, so most of them will disappear, but a few of em will show through. A few of em will show through. Maybe back in here, theres a few little duders"
Bob Ross,"Cause they live all through the woods, any time you have trees and bushes, youve gotta have all these little sticks to hold them up. Hmm, its where my little squirrel plays, yeah. Okay, now then"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, that old one inch, or two inch brush is working pretty good. Im gonna take it and tap it right into Yellow Ochre. Im just tapping one corner into Yellow Ochre, just give it a little tap"
Bob Ross,"Just a little, lets go up in here. Now, with that, lets see where were at. I wanna put the indication, gorgeous, gorgeous, works"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put the indication here of all kinds of little leaves and things that are on this tree. There. See, but leave some little spots that are dark, dont cover them all up"
Bob Ross,"I know, I know, its such a temptation. When it gets working well and you get excited about it, to cover up all the dark areas. If you do, then you have no depth in your little tree"
Bob Ross,"He wont play with ya. Isnt that a neat little tree. Just made with the top corner, of the old two inch brush"
Bob Ross,"We can take a little Alizarin Crimson and add to that color, just to change the flavor a little"
Bob Ross,"And maybe, maybe Ill leave these like they are, and sort of in the foreground here, we begin to pick out other little individuals. Still just using the top corner of the brush. Its that easy"
Bob Ross,"Alizarin Crimson and a little bit of, there, oh, thats beautiful. There we are. Alizarin Crimson and Yellow Ochre. Thats all were using. Thats all were using"
Bob Ross,"Maybe this one here, its up to you, you decide. But dont highlight all of em, leave some of em like theyre far far away. They dont have any highlight on em"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little more crimson, just to change the flavor. Im putting crimson in there just to change the flavor a little bit. So one bush will stand out from another"
Bob Ross,"There we go, look at the depth in there already, just from doing something like that. Over here, lets go over on the other side, er, right there. Lets put a little duder in there. Okay"
Bob Ross,"But you can put as many layers of trees and bushes in your world as you want. That easy, that easy"
Bob Ross,"This black canvas, once again, color shows up so much stronger on it than it will on a plain white canvas. When you paint on black canvas, that color will just pop, itll jump right out at ya"
Bob Ross,You dont need as much color. Okay. Let me grab an old two inch brush here. Im gonna go right back into some of the dark brown. This is the brown we made from Alizarin Crimson and Sap Green
Bob Ross,"And maybe, yeah, Im gonna put a few little dark bushes that live right here in the foreground. Cause all of them, maybe this light isnt hitting. And you just continually play light against dark"
Bob Ross,"Dark against light. Thats what makes it show. There. Something about like so, about like that. Anything that were not happy with, we can change it"
Bob Ross,"laughs Cause as you know, we dont make mistakes, we just have happy accidents. Im gonna take a little bit of white, little bit of that dark color, and mix it together. Something like so. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, maybe Ill pull a little yellow in there too. A little Yellow Ochre, yeah thats nice, I like that. Cut off a little roll of paint, right on the edge of the knife"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little path that lives out through here. If there is, you have to decide in your world, where it lives. And all you do is just rub it like so. Something about like that"
Bob Ross,"Something about like that. Wherever you think it should be. There. Okay, maybe Ill have it come all the way down. Wherever, wherever, it doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Anything that were not happy with, well just change it. No big deal. Okay. Now, I think its time for your bravery test"
Bob Ross,"Maybe in our world, lets use the old Filbert brush, maybe theres an old tree that lives out here. An old tree. Now, you have to decide where the tree lives"
Bob Ross,"As I say, this is gonna be your bravery test. grunts and laughs Just drop it in, drop it in, I know thats scary after you worked so hard, but the paints very thick here"
Bob Ross,"Very thick, Im using the Filbert brush, cause it leaves a heavy layer of paint on here, and I want that. I like, I like it. Lets give him an arm here. See, you decide how many arms your old tree has"
Bob Ross,"And how many foots he has, theres an old foot hanging over there. And trees grow about any old way, shoot. Yeah, Ill get brave here. Well give him another arm. About like that. There"
Bob Ross,"But any way you paint a tree, chances are, somewhere thats a tree that looks like that"
Bob Ross,"Years ago, I tried painting portraits, and you know, I had a hard time, because number one, I couldnt capture the essence of what a person, what makes a person an individual"
Bob Ross,"But the other thing was, if you paint a landscape, and it doesnt come out just right, somebody else will come along and say Hey, Ive seen that place.  Maybe I used to fish and play there"
Bob Ross,"But if you paint a portrait that has one eye square or something, I guarantee you, everybodys gonna notice it. laughs So, I gave up portrait painting"
Bob Ross,"My portrait teacher told me to go paint bushes and trees, cause thats where my heart was. So thats what I did. Take a little bit of that brown color we had, and very lightly just barely touching"
Bob Ross,"Just let it graze, and the high points on there. Cause remember the paints thick, the high points on there will pick up this color. Look at that, maybe this limb, maybe its in front, its up to you"
Bob Ross,"If you want it in front, you put it in front. Can do easy. Very easy. There, but gentle touch, just enough so the paint comes off. Let it just barely graze"
Bob Ross,"Barely graze, you can make some gorgeous, gorgeous effects. Then well sort of blend it back, makes the limbs look round. That easy, that easy. This old Filbert brush does wonderful things"
Bob Ross,"There we are. Okay, gonna take our liner brush, gonna paint some tree limbs on here. Might as well get a lot of paint thinner. Once again, were gonna thin the paint, til its almost ink consistency"
Bob Ross,"Not quite, but almost. Something like so. And with that, then you have to sort of start deciding where all the little limbs live on your tree. Cause theyre here. Theyre here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe Ill put a bunch of limbs on these. Ill tell you what. You know, every so often, we like to put together painting photographs that people have sent and show em to you"
Bob Ross,"Now today, let me do that. This is paintings that have come from people all over the country, who are just watching the show, and theyve picked up the brush, and theyve treid it"
Bob Ross,"Arent they fantastic. They really and truly are. And a lot of these people have never, absolutely never touched a brush before in their life. And theyre doing paintings like these"
Bob Ross,"Im so, Im like an old mother hen here, I get so proud when I see what people are doing. And everywhere I go, in letters I receive everyday, it brings a whole new eras of confidence to people"
Bob Ross,"Because if they can do this, and they never believe they could do, then they know they can do anything. Absolutely anything. All you have to do is believe, practice a little bit, and off you go"
Bob Ross,"Personally, I think thats true of anything in life. You just, if you can believe it, you can do it. There, see. All kinds of little limbs"
Bob Ross,Now you could really take a lot of time and put just hundreds of little limbs on here
Bob Ross,"Little tiny rascals that live everywhere, and its gorgeous, as you know, on TV here, we have this mean old director. If I go past 30 minutes, she has no sense of humor at all"
Bob Ross,"So well try to get this done in time. But when youre doing yours, take your time. You dont have the same problems we do here. Put a lot of limbs on here. Put a little squirrel lives in there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe paint Peapod in there, or you can put a little bird in there. Anything that you want, any old thing that you want. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now remember the contact papers right there, so we dont care over here, we can do any old thing. Dont worry about that, were gonna pull that off at the end of the show. Alright"
Bob Ross,Maybe theres an old dead one hanging right there. grunts Thats where my little squirrel would sit if he was there. Thats where he would sit
Bob Ross,He likes those limbs where he can watch whats going on all over the yard. There. Okay. That gives you an idea of what you can do
Bob Ross,"As I say, you can spend a lot of time just putting in tree limbs and stuff. Put in all types of individual little limbs there. And its gorgeous. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now then, lets take our old brush thats got the dark brown on it, maybe get a little Van Dyke Brown here. Van Dyke, cause its even darker"
Bob Ross,"Its not as transparent as that other is, and I want that very dark, to push that path back in there. Mix a little Dark Sienna with it too. Give it a little push. There"
Bob Ross,"All those little rascals just go far back in the distance. Maybe theres some little duders here, I dont know. Wherever you want em. Maybe theres a whole line of em that go back"
Bob Ross,"All we need to do is get em in dark first. Okay. Ill tell you what, laughs lets get crazy. Im gonna take my old Filbert brush"
Bob Ross,"Take it through brown on one side, the other side, Im going through this light color. Just like so. Lets go up in here, and maybe, maybe theres remains of an old fence here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe an old fence there, get a little more color on there. Maybe this really a ragged old fence, we dont even know wherever we want it. There comes one. Maybe it comes on around sort of like that"
Bob Ross,"Load a little more color on the brush. Right here, maybe theres still an old rail or two left. Just a couple. Most of them are long gone. Now take a little Yellow Ochre"
Bob Ross,"Lets put the indication here and there of some little highlights on these bushes that we dropped in a little Alizarin Crimson in there. Just a change of flavor, oh yeah"
Bob Ross,"I like to make bushes with this two inch brush, just to show how easy it is to create some of these illusions"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, if you can do it with a two inch brush, and do it pretty good, think how well you can do it when you use a small brush. Just a way to get you interested in it. Alright"
Bob Ross,"And a few little duders out in here. Might even be a few little things showing right in here. Up to you, you decide where theyre at. There. Back to our little liner brush"
Bob Ross,"Put a few little sticks and twigs and things, that grow right in here. Maybe, Ill tell you what lets do, lets get crazy, maybe theres a tree that lives right there. Maybe he died"
Bob Ross,Nothing but his old skeleton hanging around here. But he still has a place in nature. There. Just to sort of bring everything together. Alright
Bob Ross,"Put a little bush right there, and thatll help push him back into the painting. Something like that"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, I think were about to the point where we can take the contact paper off here and see what we got. Thats always the moment of truth. Thats the moment of truth"
Bob Ross,"Just straighten out the bottoms there a little. I like to, Im gonna highlight these just a little more. These little fence posts, just wanna make them zing. You can do that, just like so"
Bob Ross,"There, now they stand out. Alright, lets take the contact paper off, and see what we got today. This is the moment of truth. Isnt that fantastic. These little paintings with ovals are so unique"
Bob Ross,"People absolutely love em. Absolutely love em. I think this ones about ready for a signature. Well take a little bit of red, and lets sign this one. Lets sign him right here. Call him finished"
Bob Ross,"Really hope youve enjoyed this painting. Also hope in this show, you enjoyed seeing the paintings that other people, all over the country are doing"
Bob Ross,"If you have time, take a photo of what youre doing, send to us and let us show it. Until next time, happy painting and God bless my friend. Interlude by Larry Owens"
Bob Ross,"light music - Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today, wed do a different little painting using some of the liquid black and liquid white"
Bob Ross,"So lets start out and have em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While theye doing that, let me show you what I got"
Bob Ross,"Got my standard old, pre-stretched, double prime canvas. Today, Ive taken liquid black, and put on the bottom. And liquid white put on the top, it just blended in together"
Bob Ross,"So, the entire canvas is wet. But its dark on the bottom. Thats the only difference. Liquid black is just like liquid white, only it has a black pigment in it"
Bob Ross,And I use that a lot of times when I know theres gonna be areas that theres a lot of dark in. The liquid black will make it a lot easier for you
Bob Ross,Lets start today with a little bit of Alizarin crimson. Just a small amount on a little two-inch brush. Just a little. Lets go up in here. I want to put a little pink in the sky
Bob Ross,But I dont want much. I just want enough to warm it up some. I dont want to set it on fire. Its very easy to set it on fire. Just want to warm it up
Bob Ross,"Now, the crimson is mixing with the liquid white. It is a little liquid black there. And automatically, it will get lighter and lighter in value. That easy. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Thats about all I want of the crimson. There. Now, without cleaning the brush, Ill go right into some phthalo blue. I like phthalo blue. Its a beautiful, beautiful blue. Okay, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"Now, we start right at the top, using our Xs, little cris-cross strokes, go all the way across the top. All the way across. And then begin blending downward. And be careful"
Bob Ross,"This blue is so much stronger than the crimson. It will eat up all the crimson very quickly. Very quickly. So lets just have it about like that, and then clean your brush"
Bob Ross,"And well take the clean brush, and blend them both together. Just shake it off. Beat the devil out of it. That really is the fun part of this whole technique"
Bob Ross,I have more pleasure just beating the brush than anybody in the country. I have people now that write me letters and say they have no desire to paint
Bob Ross,"They just bought a brush so they can beat it and take out their frustrations. Thats okay. Thats okay. Alright. Lets do. Lets put some mountains in there today, shoot"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some Prussian blue, some black, Alizarin crimson, Van Dyke brown. Just mix em together. Mix em together. Make a nice dark, dark color. Put a little more crimson in it. There. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Now, the first thing we have to do is decide where our mountain lives. Well cut off a little roll of paint. There, you can see it. Lets go. Maybe theres a mountain, lives right here"
Bob Ross,"Now, the only thing were concerned about, is the nice, outside edge. We could care less whats going on anywhere except the top. Right in there. So, dont worry about it"
Bob Ross,Dont let a mountain scare you. Theyre really one of the neatest things to paint in this technique. And still probably the most popular thing we paint
Bob Ross,"Alright, Im gonna take two-inch brush, grab it, and pull. Because theres liquid white and liquid black underneath, the color will move. Itll allow you to blend the color right on the canvas"
Bob Ross,"And it also removes excess paint. So, the next layer will be much easier to apply. And well just let it fade right into that, like that. See there. Thats all there is to it. Lets take white, white"
Bob Ross,"Grab some midnight black a little bit and put in there. I want to grey this a little bit. So, we put a little bit of, maybe even a touch of bright red"
Bob Ross,"Its our world, we can do anything that we want here. Pull the paint out as flat as you can get it. Once again, our little roll of paint. Lets go up here"
Bob Ross,"Now then, just decide where the lights coming from. And if youre right-handed, youll find its usually easier to have it coming from the right side. Left-handed, try both ways"
Bob Ross,"Left-handed people, have been forced to do right-handed things their entire life. So some left-handed people will find it easier to highlight on the right, some on the left"
Bob Ross,"Its a very individual thing. There we are. Little dooders in there. Now, Im just gonna, pull a little bit of that color down to make the shadows. I dont want distinct shadows in here"
Bob Ross,"Just gonna pull a little bit of it down. Maybe, right over in here, theres a little bump right there. See there. You decide. You decide where all these little things live. There"
Bob Ross,"And you can just place some darks and lights back and forth, to create all kinds of illusions. There you go. Okay. Now, as I say, its your world"
Bob Ross,"You decide where you want all these little rascals to live. Okay, well take a clean, be sure its good and dry. Clean, dry two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"If its not dry, it will dilute the paint, and make it too soft. So, be sure its dry. Follow the basic angles in these mountains, and tap"
Bob Ross,"All were doing is trying to take out the little tap marks and blend everything together. And then, lift upward. See. Smooths it right out. And it creates that illusion of mist, right down at the base"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes, its a little too straight for me. Im gonna, put a little dooder right there. See. Its all you gotta a do. You can change your mind. And it just makes it a little more interesting"
Bob Ross,"Ready to get brave. Lets do it. That little mountain went so well. laughs This really is your bravery test. Lets have a big mountain, that lives right up here. Right up here"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres a little bump right there. Dont be afraid of these mountains, shoot. Once you make friends with this knife, theyre one of the neatest things you can make"
Bob Ross,And you do need to make friends with the knife. It takes a little time. Takes a little time. Its like anything else when you do it at first. Its a little foreign to you
Bob Ross,"It takes a little while to make friends with it. Alright. Very quickly, with a little practice, youll be doing things with a knife, you just cant believe. Okay. There"
Bob Ross,"Here in the studio, we just had a couple of my young friends come in. And, they were only about, one was six and one was younger than that. And they brought me some paintings that theyre doing"
Bob Ross,"Its unreal, what young people can do with this too. They were fantastic. Okay, now. Were just gonna blend that, just let it go right and all, whew"
Bob Ross,"We said we was gonna make a big mountain, we werent kidding. Once again, our little roll of paint. Touch, no pressure. Absolutely no pressure. Just let the paint glide right along on there"
Bob Ross,"Let it glide. You want it to break. In other words, have all these holes in it. Thats what makes it look interesting. There maybe is a little light zinging right on there. Wherever, its up to you"
Bob Ross,"Painting gives you freedom. Gives you creative freedom. lets take some Prussian blue and some white, a little black in it, just to dull it down some. There. Well make us a little shadow color"
Bob Ross,"Small roll of paint. And once again, just let it just glide right along there, like that. Maybe out here, just a little highlight right in there. We just sort of let them come together"
Bob Ross,Just let your imagination take you to any place that you want to go. Look up there. See there. Just let it go. Just let it slide right down though there. No pressure
Bob Ross,"I know you get tired of hearing that, but its so important, and its probably the single biggest mistake that people make, is apply too much pressure. No pressure"
Bob Ross,Im gonna put some little bumps and stuff in here. And we can do that. Put them anywhere that we want em. There. Just a little. Maybe theres a little dooder that lives over here
Bob Ross,"Mountains grow every which way. Just let em grow. Let em go, wherever they want to be. There. Just, a few little things down in here. Take a little more of our shadow color. There"
Bob Ross,"But that creates the illusion of all kinds of little dooders. And when youre at home and have unlimited time, shoot, you can do much better than this. Much, much better, I know you can. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Wherever. Wherever. Okay. Something about like him. Now, lets get our brushes. Nice and dry. And lets just blend this, very gently. Just blend it. Were tapping, following those angles"
Bob Ross,"Notice the angles are coming down, like that, and we follow those angles. We follow, okay. Little bit of shadows, right here behind this little rascal. Dont want him left out"
Bob Ross,"Then we can bring all of that together. Lift upward. Takes out the tap marks, brings everything together, like that"
Bob Ross,"Ill tell you, the best mountain painter in this technique, is probably my son, Steve. That rascal, whew. He can paint some mountains. Maybe well get him on here before the series is over"
Bob Ross,"He travels and teaches all over the country. But, if we can get that little rascal in here, well have him come to the show. Maybe Ill get him to paint you a mountain, because he can paint mountains"
Bob Ross,"Course, I sound like a proud Daddy just keep yaking bout him. And theres some truth to that. There is some truth. Okay. Thatll give us a pretty good, little mountain"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna have time to do some other things than this. Lets take Prussian blue, phthalo green, black, brown. Oh, willing, throw about any old dark color in there"
Bob Ross,"I like to throw a little of that phthalo green into it. Ill make some evergreens. It just gives them a nice, nice color. Alright. Today, to make some evergreens. Lets grab us a"
Bob Ross,"Well use a fan brush. Well use the old fan brush. You could use a one-inch brush, whatever, it doesnt matter. Anything that works. Load both sides with a lot of paint. Lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"And, lets just tap in, the basic indication of some little evergreens, that live far away back here. Theyre far away. They live right under the bottom of this mountain"
Bob Ross,"Its one of the easiest ways Ive ever seen, to create the illusion of a lot of little trees, very simply. Very, very simply"
Bob Ross,"But now, one of the things that happens a lot, sometimes theres too much distance between em, and they begin looking like fence posts"
Bob Ross,"If that should happen, all you need to do is put a few more in there. Just fill up the area. There. Because theyre too far away, youre not gonna see a lot of detail"
Bob Ross,"Things that are far away, you see only basic shape, form, and basic color. Thats really about all. Maybe well have em coming over here too"
Bob Ross,"And to create that illusion of distance in your painting, avoid having too much detail, when things are supposed to be far, far away. Yeah. I know that sounds crazy, dont put too much detail"
Bob Ross,"Sometimes we can absolutely put too much. Okay, here we are. And we just sort of smash em down, with the old fanbrush. These fan brushes are marvelous"
Bob Ross,"Theyll do wonderful, wonderful things, where you paint an entire painting, using nothing but the fan brush. maybe well do that in one of the shows sometime. Just to show you we can"
Bob Ross,"The big thing is time. Im gonna tap the base of that. Like so, there we are. Now, were gonna lift up. It just smooths everything out. Blends it right into the painting. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Now we have a whole ridge of just little trees that live there. Okay, well just use that same old brush. Its got, put some sap green in it. And it has a little bit of that pine tree color"
Bob Ross,"So when we touch yellow, were gonna get beautiful, beautiful greens, thatll end in yellow. And then Ill touch a little of the bright red. Bright red actually dulls the color"
Bob Ross,"I know it sounds crazy, but red and green make brown. So, when you put em together, it dulls the color. Now then, yeah"
Bob Ross,"And notice I didnt have to put any dark color in there, because we used the liquid black. Thats what its great for. I knew there was gonna be a lot of dark in there"
Bob Ross,"Didnt know exactly where, but it doesnt much matter. But I knew there was gonna be a lot in there"
Bob Ross,"So, Lets just take, and begin tapping in the indication of all kinds of little things that are happening back here. Wherever. There they are. Just little happy dooders. I make up words"
Bob Ross,"Im very bad about that. I often wondered, we have the shows playing in numerous foreign countries now, I often wonder how they translate, Dooders.  There we are. Alright. I like to go to Mexico"
Bob Ross,"The shows been playing in Mexico for several years, Mexico City especially. And, its unbelievable, some of the paintings that our Mexican instructors are coming up with. Unbelievable"
Bob Ross,"Because, theyve adapted this to, the scenery that they see in Mexico. And now, we have a lot of instructors in Japan, and theyre doing exactly the same thing. So, theyre teaching me now"
Bob Ross,"Thats nice, when you can have and get so lazy and let somebody else do it, and let them teach you. Here we are See how that land flows downward"
Bob Ross,"I want it to look like a little meadow back here, where the land just flows, just flows right down, very soft. There we are. You make the decision how far down it goes"
Bob Ross,"I tell you what, I tell you what. Im sorry, I get crazy. laughs When you paint like this for any length of time, you begin seeing things in your painting"
Bob Ross,"When you see these things, take advantage of em. Take advantage of em. Use em. Theyre like gifts, use em. I want to, yeah. Ill just do it. I just wanna put, maybe do some more evergreens here"
Bob Ross,"Yeah, Ill put a whole line here. There. I need all these trees, cuz my little squirrel needs a place to hide"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, I got another little piece of film here I want to show you about my little squirrel, Peapod. He is just the cutest little devil youve ever seen"
Bob Ross,"Now, how could you not fall in love with someone like him. Isnt he precious. Thus is my little squirrel, Peapod. He lives with me"
Bob Ross,"Well, actually he lives outside, and he just, cuz Ive turned him loose quite a while back. Hes full grown now. He was just sort of a baby there. But her still comes back, everyday, everyday"
Bob Ross,"And I feed him, Im soft-touched. But, aint he something. I always have a lot of scratches on my hands and stuff and playing with him, because they have very sharp claws"
Bob Ross,"The one thing I like to say over and over, we do not ever keep, making these wild creatures pets. I only raise em and I turn em loose. Because wild creatures, thats where they belong"
Bob Ross,"They should be wild. If you want to keep a creature, get a domestic animal. Doggy or a cat. Theyre a lot of fun. Theyre a lot of company. But, wild creatures are to be wild"
Bob Ross,"Thats the way God intended it to be. There we are. But sometimes they need a little help. And if they do, I jump right in there. I like to play with them. Like to watch them grow"
Bob Ross,"But these little squirrels, when I get em, a lot of times theyre so small, that their eyes arent even open"
Bob Ross,"And then you have to get up at night, just like, well, like I did with Steve when he was a tiny, little baby. And you have to feed him two or three times every night"
Bob Ross,"Of course, Steves not so tiny anymore. Hes over 65, almost 66. Must have fed him good. Yeah. That rascal, certainly grew. He out grew me. Well take a little bit of white"
Bob Ross,"I wanna create the illusion of a little mist down here at the base of these. Ill show you why, just to set it"
Bob Ross,"And Ill put some thats more distinct, in this little misty area here, this little misty area, will turn out to be your best friend, because this will be your separator"
Bob Ross,"And you could just bang it in any old way, and then well just tap it till it blends together. Makes the base of the trees look very soft and gentle. There. And most of this will disappear"
Bob Ross,"But here and there and there and here, we want to put a more distinct tree, a bigger tree. Well put a little more paint on here. Get all that phthalo green there. Oh, I like it. Brown and crimson"
Bob Ross,"Ill put some sap in there too, I didnt have much phthalo. And I want to have a green tint to it. Okay. lets see what we got here. Maybe, you know, Bobby. Gotta have a big tree in here somewhere"
Bob Ross,Gotta have a big old tree. Here it comes. There we are. Well put some highlights on there and separate it. Thatll separate it right apart. Lets give him a friend. There we go. Right there
Bob Ross,"I know its hard to see right now, but, well separate it. Well separate it. Maybe here and there we can put the indication of a few more, a little closer to us, a little bigger, a little more detail"
Bob Ross,And then that little misty area will separate em. Well just put a few in here. You decide in your world how many there are. There we go. Something like that. I need one down here. Just right there
Bob Ross,"Okay. Now, without doing anything to that brush except going through yellow, because it has blue and black in it, youll make a beautiful green color. Thatll give us the highlight. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Lets go back up here. Same old brush. There we are. Now, we can put in a few little highlights. Dont kill all your dark color. I know its tempting"
Bob Ross,"A little yellow ochre, Indian yellow just mixed in there, change of flavor. But dont kill all the dark. Evergreens are normally pretty dark trees. Leave em that way. There. A little over in here"
Bob Ross,"Im just bopping around here trying to get these put in as quick as I can. Ill put a few more little things in this painting, its a lot of fun. This liquid black, try it. Try it"
Bob Ross,"I think youll find it does wonderful things. Now then, maybe, yeah, why not. Lets start. Well put in some little grassy areas and there. Little yellow"
Bob Ross,Im gonna dip the brush into at least a little touch of paint thinner. Just enough to thin the paint a tiny bit. Were getting quite a buildup of paint on here
Bob Ross,"So we need to paint this a little thinner. See it there. Look at all the layers in this painting. I mean, it just goes on and on and on. And you can do it so simple. There we are"
Bob Ross,"Okay, and maybe a little touch of the bright red here and there. I like it. I like it with red in there, it does nice things. Okay. We need a little path in there"
Bob Ross,"Let me take a little Dark Sienna, Van Dyke brown. Gotta have a way to get in there. Well just put us a little path right in there. Mostly Dark Sienna"
Bob Ross,"Put a little of the Van Dyke, and well let it wander right on out through there. Little brown, little white. Just enough to put the indication of a little highlight on there. There, see"
Bob Ross,"Its that easy. Just like youre putting snow on the mountain. Maybe, I know. laughs Lets take a little black. Maybe come right up in here. Maybe theres just a little stone that is right there"
Bob Ross,"Happy little stone. We put in dark first. And we come back with some brown, white, a little black in it. And lets put a little highlight on that, just enough to make it interesting. Just enough, see"
Bob Ross,"Pull a little but of it down, not much, not much. Alright. Then, some little grassy areas right around his foot. Bring the path all into the painting. There. Alright. Got just a minute left here"
Bob Ross,"Tell you what, Ill need a tree in here. I need a little tree. My producer right now is gonna kill me for doing this. Right there is a little tree"
Bob Ross,"And well take, a little light color, just tap the side here Give it some highlight. Grab a liner brush, put a couple little tree branches on it. This old tree is dead. This old tree had a bad day"
Bob Ross,"Old evergreen tree, you just need some little limbs hanging out through there. Wherever. Not many left, just a few. See. But thats really all there is to it. Hope youve enjoyed this little painting"
Bob Ross,"Its something different. Shows you how to use the liquid black, and I believe itll bring you fantastic results. From all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend"
Bob Ross,light music
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back, glad to see you today. I thought today wed do a little sea scape"
Bob Ross,"So, Ill tell you what, lets start out Ive brought all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, let me show you this crazy thing Ive got up here today. Today I have my standard old canvas, but Ive taken a piece of contact paper and Ive cut a design out"
Bob Ross,"In fact, the design, if everything works just right, will sort of look like a seashell. On the top, Ive painted the, little more than half, Ive painted it with gray gesso. On the bottom, black gesso"
Bob Ross,"And then, weve taken and covered the entire thing with a very thin coat of liquid clear. Just enough to cover, you dont need much"
Bob Ross,"On the bottom, down here, Ive taken a little bit of Phthalo Blue and Phthalo Green and put it, just put a little color right on there and right at the very bottom, a little bit of Van Dyke Brown"
Bob Ross,"Thats all. And Ive got a piece of little masking tape right here to keep the horizon straight. Believe it or not, its a lot simpler than it sounds"
Bob Ross,"Lets start with a little Indian Yellow today, and lets just go right in here and drop in a little bit of color using the old two inch brush. Just like so"
Bob Ross,I like using this gray and black gesso it makes some gorgeous effects. Just absolutely gorgeous
Bob Ross,"Take a little bit of white, a little bit of Yellow Ochre and mix them together and come right above that. A little touch of the Titanium White in it though. Thatll make it shine, sparkle. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now then. I want it to be very bright right there at the horizon. Once again, this little piece of masking tape here is just to keep the horizon straight"
Bob Ross,"Okay, without cleaning the brush, I going to go right into a small amount, a very small amount, of the red, Bright Red. Bright Red. Maybe a little touch of the Titanium White in it again"
Bob Ross,"Since we have no color on the top, sometimes you need to put a little bit of white paint with it. There we go. Isnt that pretty already. I like these colors"
Bob Ross,"And you can do this to any degree of brightness that you want. Alright. Now, maybe a little Alizarin Crimson. Im going to add a little bit of white to that, too. Alizarin Crimson, Titanium White"
Bob Ross,"And lets just put a little of that in there. I want it to get progressively darker as we move away from the horizon. Okay, as I say these colors are pretty just like that. Just like that"
Bob Ross,"And, right up here at the very tippy top lets have, Ill tell you what, lets use Phthalo Blue. I like Phthalo Blue, its very pretty. And, well just put a little touch of that in there. There"
Bob Ross,"A little bit of Titanium White with it also. Okay, maybe a little more white. If you want it to stand out a little brighter, add a little more of the white. Okay, see there, thats all there is to it"
Bob Ross,"Now then, let me just wash the old brush. Im just looking for an excuse to wash the brush. Shake off the paint thinner. taps brush laughs Just beat the devil out of it"
Bob Ross,"If youre going to do that, be careful, you can change the decor of a room in a heartbeat. There. Something about like so. Now then, that gives us a pretty nice little sky"
Bob Ross,"Very colorful, very effective, thats not bad at all. Just beat the excess paint out there"
Bob Ross,"Lets take, lets take a little Phthalo Blue, Alizarin Crimson, proportionately much more crimson than blue, I want this to be sort of to the reddish side of lavender. Okay, there we are"
Bob Ross,"Now, let me clean the old brush, knife, whatever weve got. Lets find a, well use a number 3 fan brush. It doesnt matter, thats what I picked up so thats what well use. Load a little color on it"
Bob Ross,"You dont need a whole bunch, just a little color on it. Okay, lets go up in here. Maybe in our world here, there are some happy little clouds that just float around and have a good time all day"
Bob Ross,"They just sort of float around just decide where they live in your world and drop them in. Drop them in. Wherever, wherever, wherever, it doesnt matter. It doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"There, just sort of stir them up on there. Were going to come back with a little blender brush and softly blend them together"
Bob Ross,"There, well just use this little, well just blend it with this little two inch brush. See. Very gently. Very, very gently. That easy"
Bob Ross,"Using just the top corner of the brush making little tiny circles.  Tiny little circles  There you go, just like that. Okay, now then. Over here, well just blend it"
Bob Ross,"Blend it and blend it and blend it. And then maybe  in our world  maybe, yeah why not. Maybe theres several little clouds. We can have as many clouds as we want"
Bob Ross,"In your world, you decide how many you want. Drop them in. Now use this lavender color, because if you use blue and went into this yellow, guess what youd have. You know, dont you"
Bob Ross,"Youd have bright green. And we dont want that today up here in the sky. Sometimes, maybe a little green in the sky is okay, but not today, not today, not today. There"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, while Ive got that going, maybe over here theres just a little stringy cloud. See, just put in a basic shape, thats all you need, thats all, it doesnt matter. Clouds are very easy"
Bob Ross,"taps brush There. Beating that brush just to take off excess paint. I used it before to blend, so it collected a little paint. But when youre doing clouds like this, do them in layers"
Bob Ross,"Do the one that you think is the farthest away first. And then put the next layer a little closer to you. Put it on top, that way it has the feeling of depth and distance. Alright"
Bob Ross,"Now this is just a very, very simple way of making some little clouds in a seascape. Very easy, even if youve never painted a seascape before. This one, I believe you can do without any problem"
Bob Ross,"Alright, this little cloud here, just blend over it. See, itll just softly go right into the painting. That easy. Take a brush here, and take a little white paint"
Bob Ross,"And you can blend this out and make it look like theres light shining through. Theres a million things you can do. When you start this, practice and have fun"
Bob Ross,"Dont just try to do exactly what we do here on TV. Do your own thing. Do your own thing, thats what the young people say. And its true in painting. Just get in there and do it. There"
Bob Ross,I like to work with young people because they dont know any of the fears that we know when we get a little older. They just get in there and do it. Im going to take this little piece of tape off now
Bob Ross,"Just slip it right off. There we are, now, see our horizon line is perfectly straight, or as straight as the tape was. It just makes life a little easier"
Bob Ross,"Okay, take a little white, take a little of that same old cloud color I was using. Maybe far back in the distance in our world here, maybe theres a little headland that lives out in here"
Bob Ross,"It comes way out, wherever you want it to go. There. See. Thats all there is to it. Far away, we dont want a lot of detail. Its too far away. Much, much too far away"
Bob Ross,"Give it a little pull, just to blend the color together. Because that canvas is wet, paint will move on it that easy. See, already it looks like a little piece of land far, far in the distance"
Bob Ross,"Okay, lets wash the old brush. Fan brush isnt near as much fun to wash as the two inch brush is. Now then, we have to start making some big decisions"
Bob Ross,"For me, the easiest way to paint a seascape is to first determine where your major wave is going to be. Or the big old crasher wave"
Bob Ross,"In our world, I think its going to be maybe right there, crash over. Come back this way. Helps to make little sounds like you are at the ocean"
Bob Ross,"Now if this doesnt make any sense, think about it, right here its going to crash over. Okay, does that make sense now. Hope, so, and maybe back in here a little thing like that"
Bob Ross,"Thats really about all we need. Thats really about all we need. Okay, let me wipe the brush off. Im just wiping all the excess paint off"
Bob Ross,"Now then, we want to start creating the shape of these waves. And whats important here is the dark area. Save the dark area. Thats what were looking for. See, there. Can you see whats happening"
Bob Ross,"I know at first, it doesnt make sense when someone says save the dark area. But the dark is what will form the basic shape. The light, no big deal. See, the same thing back here"
Bob Ross,"Already, youre beginning to see the little trough between the waves. See that dark area right there. Its the most important, most, most important"
Bob Ross,"And then we can start putting in just little indications of things that are far away. We have that Phthalo Blue and Phthalo Green color thats underneath on the dark, black canvas"
Bob Ross,"And these things just work. Look at that color. If people dont see you put this color on, do a demonstration for your family or friends, and dont let them see you put the color on"
Bob Ross,"Itll drive them crazy. Theyll think magic is happening there when they see all these colors that just explode. Because the canvas will still look black. Alright. Now then, lets start deciding"
Bob Ross,"Well take a little yellow, Cad Yellow, and a little white, right in here. Right in here will be the eye. So well put that yellow in there. Well just use a fan brush, it doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Filbert brush works very nice for this too. Okay, better wash that brush, its a little dirty. Because we want this brush to be very clean so we can blend the eye of that wave. The pretty part"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now we take just the corner of that brush"
Bob Ross,"Just the corner, and just very gently, very gently, using just the corner just begin to turn it a little bit, just wiggle it, and itll blend that out as smooth as silk. Just like that"
Bob Ross,"Now, I changed corners, so we still have a clean corner if you want to go back and blend it a little more. Dont take a dirty corner back in there. Alright, see there. But isnt that neat"
Bob Ross,"Already, you can see the light zinging right through there. taps brush And its very simple. Very simple. Seascapes, seascapes can give you a hard time when you first start them"
Bob Ross,I try to make them as simple as possible. Titanium White on the fan brush. Titanium White. This is the fun part. Thats where the old wave just crashes over and has fun
Bob Ross,"Take some of that lavender color, Ive still got the same brush, a little white on it, doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"And some of that lavender color that we, that we made for the sky and the little headland in the background. And lets begin putting in this shadow here. This is just the shadow for the crasher"
Bob Ross,"There it comes. Maybe it splashes clean up like that. I dont know. Well put some stones in there, what the heck. So it has something to crash on. I like to put little stones in seascapes. There"
Bob Ross,"Just let that crash right on back. See, just let your imagination go. Sort of try to think like a wave"
Bob Ross,Think that youre down at the ocean today and youre having a good time and this is what it looks like to you. Lets wash the old fan brush here
Bob Ross,"Im still using the number three fan brush, but you could do it with the number six. You might find, you might find the number three is just a little easier, a little easier"
Bob Ross,"Im going to take Titanium White. Still using that number three fan brush. Add a little, light touch of yellow into it. Cad Yellow, but a light, light touch, not much. Now then, lets go up in here"
Bob Ross,"And now we can come in here and begin putting some highlights on this foam. Just highlight it. There we go, you dont want to kill all that nice shadow color that we worked so hard to put in there"
Bob Ross,"Just think about that old wave crashing over there. There it comes. Let it just churn and carry on. These things get violent. If youre a surfer, you sure know what Im talking about"
Bob Ross,"Boy, they get violent sometimes. Good clean, dry two inch brush. Barely, barely touching. Just barely touching with the corner. Blend it, blend it, blend it"
Bob Ross,"You could do this with a little soft blending brush too. It would work just as well, probably better, now that I think about it. But isnt that neat"
Bob Ross,"See the old wave coming over there crashing and banging and carrying on. Alright. Maybe lets take some Midnight Black, Midnight Black, Van Dyke, we just mix them together here"
Bob Ross,"Ive got another fan brush, number six now. And, maybe in our world, yup, theres a big old stone. Right in there. Right in there. Big old stone"
Bob Ross,"And, maybe theres another stone there where all this is crashing and churning it coming in right, like that, like that, like that. See"
Bob Ross,"Now sometimes you can take the liner brush, well use some Bright Red, it doesnt matter, theres paint thinner on it. And you can go in here and just very carefully begin to shape your rocks"
Bob Ross,"You can just shape them. There, see. Just enough to give them a little high- I want them to stay very dark. Very, very dark. Very dark"
Bob Ross,"But thats a neat way of just putting in all kinds of little details. Here comes another one. Right there. Get a little more paint thinner. There, see"
Bob Ross,"But thats one of the easiest ways Ive ever seen of forming the basic shape of little rocks. Because you dont, you dont have to do much. And Im a lazy painter"
Bob Ross,"Now then, you take a little, a little white, with a little touch of Phthalo Blue in it. And do the same thing if you want to show, like, water is running off those rocks"
Bob Ross,"Thin the paint, very, very thin, and then you can have this just churning and carrying on here any way that you want it. Then back to our little fan brush"
Bob Ross,"Have it sort of climbing up in here and there. Covering up the edges. Boy, theres a lot going on in there. But isnt that neat. And you can do it"
Bob Ross,"Okay, now maybe, we put a little Van Dyke Brown right in here"
Bob Ross,"Lets take, lets take a little Yellow Ochre, a little Titanium White, well just put it on the old brush there, maybe a little Cad Yellow in there too, thatll brighten it, oh yeah, thats it"
Bob Ross,"Thats it, now lets decide maybe the water is coming right down here, and there is some reflections in the wet sand, so pull it straight down and then go across. Thats all we have to do"
Bob Ross,"And that will give the impression of wet water or wet sand. Wet sand is what I meant to say. Take a little Titanium White, a little Phthalo Blue, mix them together. Wipe off the knife"
Bob Ross,"Now well get a little roll of paint, just like we normally put on the big knife. And with that, Im going to start using a lot of pressure. And, really bend the knife. Bend it"
Bob Ross,"Alright, this is where we decide where the water line is. Where its coming up on the bank. There. And maybe its coming down through here. However you want it. However"
Bob Ross,"Take our little fan brush, once again, grab that and begin pulling it. See there, isnt that gorgeous. It works easy. It works so easy"
Bob Ross,And you begin to have foam patterna and stuff that are coming down through here. Like that there. All kinds of little doers. A little filbert brush works great for that too
Bob Ross,"See, you can just take it and go. Make all those little watery things that happen. Lets use our script liner brush with that. Put a little bit of the blue and white on here"
Bob Ross,"And lets begin putting the indication of all kinds of little things that are happening in here. There they come. Now when you have a lot of time, you can put tremendous amounts of detail in this"
Bob Ross,"Tremendous. There. Paint thinner. I want to go into that dark lavender color, and I need a little dark line that lives right under here to pull this up. Little dark line, see it. There it comes"
Bob Ross,"Alright, and, you also need it right in here, it separates, separates it. Makes it just jump right out at you. Maybe you can see a few little dooders right in there"
Bob Ross,That helps create that curve that you want so badly in that wave. There we are. Okay
Bob Ross,taps brush And you can take a little blue and white and make the indication that maybe there are some little watery things that are happening all about through here. See there
Bob Ross,"Just to make it look like water. That easy. Okay, a little bit of Titanium White and paint thinner. A touch of blue right here, but just mainly white"
Bob Ross,And then you can begin putting in some details back in here. Just all kinds of little things. Just to give it a wave action type feel. You can put all kinds of little doers in between here
Bob Ross,"Once again, when you have time to put all these things in, just take your time and do it. Something like so"
Bob Ross,"You know, Ive gotten so many letters from people all over the country, and one of the earlier shows I showed a cartoon version of my little squirrel, Peapod"
Bob Ross,"Well, people have asked to see that again, so Im going to put him up for just a second to check out old Peapod, isnt that cute"
Bob Ross,"And Ive got another surprise for you, my cartoonist, he got a little crazy. Guess what he made a cartoon of now. Old Bob-a-loop. So, I guess youll be seeing Bob in cartoon form pretty soon"
Bob Ross,"But isnt that cute. I think so, my little painter man suit. Its just like the little opening that Jerry makes for us. Its cute though. Little painter guy. Alright. Ive got a minute left here"
Bob Ross,"I want to, yeah, check out your bravery. Okay, maybe well have us a little palm tree in here. Maybe well have a big palm tree. Alright, give him a friend. There we go. Just a little old palm tree"
Bob Ross,"Im going to grab another fan brush, I have several going. Well take, lets use a little, doesnt matter, use a little, a little light color here. Just tap along the edges and give it a little pull"
Bob Ross,"Make it look like a palm tree lives right there. A little bit on this one. There. Just to give it the, just to give it the impression of a little tree"
Bob Ross,"Now then, I want to take the brush that has the black paint in it, this is Midnight Black, and Ive put paint thinner with it to thin it. Just to thin it. Now then, here we go. Here we are"
Bob Ross,"Just take and lets just pull in a few little leaves on this old rascal. Im from Florida, so, we have a lot of palm trees around there. There we are. Okay"
Bob Ross,"Someone asked in what part of Florida I live in. I live right in Orlando, right close to Mickey Mouses house. There we are. But very soon, when we start a show in Missouri, Ill be moving there"
Bob Ross,"So I hope to see you in either place. Alright. There, see. Thats a very, very nice, easy way to make a palm tree that looks pretty good. Pretty good. Alright. A few little old limbs on him"
Bob Ross,"And you decide how many limbs are on your palm tree. And if, where theyre situated, how theyre blowing, and the wind is usually blowing, around the old ocean here. There we are"
Bob Ross,"And you can come back with your liner brush and put a lot of greens and stuff in there if you want to. Okay, Ill tell you what, lets pull the contact paper off and see what weve got here"
Bob Ross,"And, as I mentioned earlier, I tried to cut this into something that looks sort of like a seashell. And thats a little different. I have done some that Ive taken like the pattern of a fish"
Bob Ross,"A fish swims in the ocean, so I dont see anything wrong with having the ocean in the fish. Any pattern that you want works very well. Try it. If you have time, take a photo"
Bob Ross,"Send it to me, let me see what you are doing. Were going to call that little painting finished. And from all of us here, Id like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend.  Interlude"
Bob Ross,hi welcome back certainly glad you could join us today because today is a very special day every once in a while when we get him off the road from teaching classes I bring my son Steve in here let him
Bob Ross,give you a demonstration Steves been painting since he was about 12 years old and I think youll find hes absolutely fantastic Steve welcome to the show today thanks Dan tell you what Im G to turn
Bob Ross,it over to Steve and Ill see you later son do a nice painting for everyone okay uh were going to start off today by running your colors across the screen uh were using just about everything uh as
Bob Ross,you can see weve got I think about 13 colors uh so if you want to go ahead and get those out on your palette if youre going to paint along with me or whatever um Im going to start off today maybe
Bob Ross,just with a little bit of press and blue and were going to drag that out pound it into that brush real good get tough with it right from the beginning and well go up here and start in Im going to
Bob Ross,try to make some sort of Cloudy shapes up here to start with and maybe on this one side side over here Ill add just a touch a crimson to my color a lizin crimson and prean blue give it sort of a
Bob Ross,purplish glow over here you know try to use xs and leave a little bit of light area showing through like that now leave your sky with lots of movement in it here because you dont want to you dont
Bob Ross,want to destroy that that look like the sky is weaving in and out and all that stuff that helps a lot little more press and blue and a little more lizar and Crimson on your brush and well go down
Bob Ross,here and put some straight horizontal Strokes in this will be where our waters at and at the bottom of the canvas youre real rough on it youre not going to hurt that canvas okay then well wash
Bob Ross,that brush out real quick when youre doing a large painting like this its a really good idea to have a sturdy easel like this one and uh dad invented this easel just for that purpose because it
Bob Ross,doesnt move all over the floor when youre painting on it here we go just a little bit of blending down here so always start down in the liquid white and work your way up that way your brush doesnt
Bob Ross,get all full of blue immediately okay and then down in the water the same thing just use your big brush on the side like this push nice and hard you know if your wrist is wore out by the time you get
Bob Ross,done doing this you did something right and maybe with a clean brush well just go across the center a few few times want a nice little light Reflection In The Water there we go okay maybe well do a
Bob Ross,real quick Cloud a little bit of liquid white and some titanium white maybe just a touch of that alizarin Crimson in there just a little bit thats a little too much isnt it gee there we go now just
Bob Ross,drop in a few little cloudy shapes a real light touch and a lot of paint on the brush think about what a cloud looks like real light and fluffy on the top and the bottom of its basically flat if you
Bob Ross,want to make a maybe a little straight Cloud down here do it just like that and theres a possibility that theres one coming in over here too turn your brush on the side spin it just little circles
Bob Ross,thats what clouds are long as youre making little circles you cant go wrong if youre a beginner just starting out for the first time uh you might want to try this painting because its real simple
Bob Ross,real basic its one of the ones I teach in class most often lift up on those clouds go across them like Dad tells you its just three hairs and some air just a light touch there we go okay maybe well
Bob Ross,put a little mountain back here in the distance well start off with a little white a little press and blue and a little lizar and Crimson white press and blue and Li lizar and Crimson there we go mix
Bob Ross,that up good and maybe this one will be back off in here in the distance way far away just make a kind of a triangular shape and then change it a little bit you know put a little bump here a little
Bob Ross,bump there there we go you guys wouldnt believe what I did the other day I went into New York City and uh helped dad work on the Don Hue show he uh went on there and did some paintings and we took
Bob Ross,five people from the studio audience and taught them how to paint too and uh then they came out on the stage and unveiled their paintings and they looked almost as good as Bob Rosss if you can
Bob Ross,believe that it was the first time theyd ever picked up a brush it just goes to show you what you can do with it even Donahue did a painting can you believe that I thought man Phil Donahue never
Bob Ross,picked up a brush in his life and he just learned from one of the videos and went on and did a beautiful painting was amazing if you uh want to take a little bit of titanium white and of course I had
Bob Ross,some of that Crimson left over in that you dont really want to use Pure White on this particular Mountain little roll of paint on the knife and just go up there and pull down real gently just lay
Bob Ross,some snow in there try not to get too much pain on just a little bit always better to have just a tiny bit of pain on the knife as you can see you can get a really nice effect with not a whole lot of
Bob Ross,effort right here okay and then if we just go in and take a little bit of press and blue and a little bit of white it can be dirty white it doesnt have to be clean we can make a nice shadow color a
Bob Ross,nice light blue there we go and then pull down pull down with those angles like I said a super light touch but you know its true you dont have to have any previous experience to paint like this I
Bob Ross,know youre probably saying oh yeah right sure tell me more but no Im serious the first time I ever did a painting I was halfway happy with the results I mean and I got compliments like you wouldnt
Bob Ross,believe it made me me feel real good inside you know so if you feel like giving it a try you are to get one of our certified instructors to teach you a class or something they travel all over the
Bob Ross,country there we go just a little bit more snow you know how mountains are they have those little snow caps okay and then lets take a big brush and tap out the bottom of that lift up into it real
Bob Ross,gently once again if youre real Brave you can even do a little bit right there maybe just a touch more snow right here just making decisions as I go I dont have any painting that Im looking at or
Bob Ross,anything like that Im just making it up thats the funnest way to do it there we go uh maybe theres a nice big Foothill coming under there little press and blue a little black little crimson and a
Bob Ross,touch of white with that Watch How I push this brush up just like that push it into the paint okay then maybe that Foothill goes right across in front of that mountain just like that now remember
Bob Ross,youre using a squared off brush here so turn it to get a nice rounded effect on top of your Hills okay and then maybe well lift up a little to give it the distant Pine Tree look thousands of little
Bob Ross,pine trees just appearing right before your eyes Ive been doing this now since I was 12 years old and Im 27 now and it never ceases to amaze me the results I can get with these huge brushes I mean
Bob Ross,if somebody you know would come to me and tell me that and I didnt paint at all I tell them they were nuts but since youre watching it happen right before your eyes it proves it and like I said
Bob Ross,anyone can do it you dont have to be a a Leonardo da Vinci or a Michelangelo to do this and Im not going to tell you that this is art that uh is going to hang in the Smithsonian or anything like
Bob Ross,that but I will tell you that your friends will probably buy paintings from you after you do a couple so you can actually make money off of it I probably shouldnt mention that but I know some of you
Bob Ross,might be interested in monetary gain from your paintings I know I am you got to make a living somehow and even if you dont want to make a living from it its real nice you know when somebody comes up
Bob Ross,and says Id love to pay you 100 for that and youre thinking wow am I really that good you know there we go nice distant Foothills now this side over here looks kind of barren so maybe we were to
Bob Ross,put a couple trees over there how about um lets see lets make this uh little bit of sap green you know at the beginning of the show they were running your colors across the screen for you so you
Bob Ross,should have those all out and ready well mix up some green some brown and some blue oh its really dark so we are to put what a little bit of white with it thatll work maybe a little more green
Bob Ross,there we go and well go through that with the fan brush pull through like this real long and flat Strokes okay maybe theres one right here and well push up push up on that brush lets go back and
Bob Ross,forth like a z pushing pushing up okay maybe a taller one right here got to have a tall buddy right beside him thats who gives him advice on those really cold days there we go youll catch me making
Bob Ross,sound effects here and there thats really good you know if sometimes if you make a little sound effect to go along with something it helps you remember that then you can just go you know doot dooot
Bob Ross,or whatever and Pops right out its easier easier to remember things that way then down in here Im just going to draw a line so I know where Im going to Im going to have my land coming around like
Bob Ross,that and then rather than wasting time with the fan brush why not fill it in with a larger brush when I say large I mean it dont I 2 in right in there just like a Foothill if you want to make it look
Bob Ross,more like grass just turn the brush over and push up on it look at that smashing it right there right there into the canvas look at that gee isz thatll wear your arm out okay a little bit more on
Bob Ross,there and maybe well reflect this down say you accidentally made this piece of land too wide well just go up in there a little bit higher when youre pulling but keep that curve down to the left on
Bob Ross,it because thats what makes it look like its further away here than it is over here thats the effect were trying to get and remember when youre pulling a reflection down pull it down as low as
Bob Ross,the things above it are high so if this tree is this high that reflection would have to go all the way to the bottom okay and why dont we just take a clean dry brush and go across that real quick and
Bob Ross,lets use that same one and go through a little bit of cadum yellow CAD yellow orll work good A little bit of thinner maybe in that about one drop of thinner its all it takes and we know yellow and
Bob Ross,blue make green so just push up into that yellow and blue combination and come in here maybe well highlight a little bit leave some of that green grass sticking up in back this is a nice nice bright
Bob Ross,color I really like it look at that you can make one come in front of another or whatever you want to do people come up to me while Im doing demonstrations and they say uh where where are those
Bob Ross,numbers at where you got those numbers hidden I say what numbers you talking about they said didnt this paint by number no way no way we dont even draw a picture on the canvas before we start not
Bob Ross,even a guideline you know once in a while when Im doing a black gesso type thing Ill do that but on white canvas I usually just Wing It people are impressed by that and you know after you take a
Bob Ross,painting class and you come back home and people see your painting they say oh my goodness I never knew they had it in them they they really think youre talented suddenly you know and you are but
Bob Ross,Ill tell you whats so fun about that is theres a Prestige that goes along with being an artist and Ill tell you what the first painting you do and you bring it home and it looks nice like that
Bob Ross,theyll say that you know this person is an artist glattus is definitely an artist suddenly people change the way they think of you too for the good and that makes you feel good inside always go
Bob Ross,across that reflection with a clean dry brush cuz you have to make it look like water down there okay and maybe a little little land under that little bit of Van Dy brown one touch right here and then
Bob Ross,just pull down thats simple look at that with the greatest of ease you have shale looks even better after you put a little bit of highlight on it just dark Sienna and white for that real simple color
Bob Ross,mix this gives it that clay look clay and rock there we go just like that now maybe with a 1in brush in that same yellow color well drop in a little grass on top of that remember whenever youre
Bob Ross,putting thin paint on top of thick paint you want to put quite a bit on the brush like this maybe a little blue with that and use a real light touch wow that turned that into a Super Color see I just
Bob Ross,guessed and it came out like that I know you probably dont believe that but thats really how I do it I just if I see two colors that look like theyd make a nice color I just put them together
Bob Ross,people ask me all the time Steve how do you know what colors to mix how do you know how to do it well I just played with it I just played with the brushes and the paints and everything everything all
Bob Ross,of it you know and suddenly things just start to happen for you like I remember that fan brush I had the hardest time learning how to paint with that fan brush then after I made like a hundred pine
Bob Ross,trees on cardboard I could make one just as good as anybody else could could have been doing it a long time you know there we go how about some uh Highlights Highlights on the pine trees little bit of
Bob Ross,the blue and the yellow together mix it up on the brush and then well come in and just smash a little bit of that in on the right hand side of those trees if you get a little bit too much highlight
Bob Ross,here or there just go back with a little bit of the dark paint and cover it up and if you really dont like something you can just scrape it off and start over and dont think of it is oh my gosh I
Bob Ross,had to scrape something off my canvas and start over dont think of it like that thats depressing think of it like I just got two canvases worth of practice for the price of one there we go theyre
Bob Ross,sitting right down in that grass and lets see maybe a little Shoreline underneath this with liquid white spin that liquid white around like that go through it and straight across straight across
Bob Ross,still water lies flat so dont let that water line get all bent up and stuff just zigzag it and maybe a couple little water lines out here lets go ahead and go through our dark green color and add a
Bob Ross,little bit more blue and green to it make it super dark and then uh maybe right here well just have a little tree its getting bigger all the time oh no its huge look at that its a monster you you
Bob Ross,can tell I knew I was going to do that didnt you look at that huge but you know what were going to do were going to put another tree in front of this one this will be like a background type thing
Bob Ross,so Im just doing it real quick not spending a lot of time on the highlighting of it either because like I said therell be a nice birch tree right over in front of there well heck that didnt look
Bob Ross,too bad like it is you know you got to keep your confidence up tell yourself youre good even if Im not happy with the way my painting is going I always try to keep in good spirits about it you know
Bob Ross,cuz its just a the painting its not its not that big of a deal okay for that birch tree get some Van Dyk Brown out there get a roll on your knife and then nice big one there we go all the way down
Bob Ross,to the bottom maybe itll have two trunks on it like I said always always give it a friend come in from the other side fatten them up a little bit feed them some more lasagna and then a little bit of
Bob Ross,titanium white for highlight on those smash that titanium white out like that and then just pull in pull in dont want to cover the whole trunk with white you want to leave half of it brown and maybe
Bob Ross,underneath there you know that same old green color you were using before add a little bit more blue and brown and green to that make it even darker just making it a little bit darker its the same
Bob Ross,color you can call that the base color just smash right over the bottom of that tree and put some bushes in there you could do that part with a paint roller and get away with it pull through your CAD
Bob Ross,yellow like this and maybe a little bit of highlight on a couple of these bushes just turn that brush just like youre going around a clock see here 1200 100 2 3 change your color put a little red
Bob Ross,in there a little yellow ochre Indian yellow its up to you well it just became a fall scene that quick didnt it thats whats nice youre not committed or anything with this can do anything you want
Bob Ross,and its always going to look nice because you did it and youre wonderful you have to believe that I heard somebody say one time never never try anything just do it thats probably the best say Ive
Bob Ross,ever heard little grass with a brush sideways like that and maybe to finish her up well have a couple branches thats just uh van Dy Brown and paint thinner together you need quite a bit of thinner
Bob Ross,in that you want an Indian ink consistency if possible extend the tops of your trees and do a few little trunks coming out keep on putting that thinner in there youre going to need a lot when you
Bob Ross,make a branch come out make it kind of like a a guy with his arm sticking out you know go out and then up little ys and little vs and try to stay away from that uh Pitchfork look yeah okay shes
Bob Ross,getting pretty close now look at that couple more branches and uh maybe a quick signature down here there we go and were all done thanks for watching me today I hope you enjoyed it and if youre a
Bob Ross,beginner try this painting its really a nice one to start off with good Music luck Music
Bob Ross,"- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad to see you today. Tell you what, lets get right on today, and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us at home"
Bob Ross,"While theyre doing that, as usual, let me show you what I have. Today I have my standard ol pre-stretched double prime canvas, and Ive just covered it with a very thin coat of liquit white"
Bob Ross,"Thats all, its wet and ready to go, so thought today maybe wed do, lets do a little winter scene, something thats lets just see what happens"
Bob Ross,"Lets start with chuckles, with black and blue, or blue and black, and well just sort of mix them together on the brush, more black than blue, though. I thought wed just play a little bit today"
Bob Ross,"Its such a wonderful day here, and I hope it is wherever youre at. So, just have a good time with this, there we are. Well just, well just pop in a little sky here and there"
Bob Ross,"Something about like so. Im going to leave in some spots open, intentionally. Just, little spots, I dont want this to be a flat ol dead sky. Want it to have some life, some action to it"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, tell you, why dont we get a little crazy here. Oh, Ive got several of these brushes going, grab another one, put a little touch, a little touch, not much, a little touch of alizarin crimson"
Bob Ross,"Maybe right along here, just so its not too bleak. Sometimes winter scenes can be very, very depressing"
Bob Ross,"Were gonna put just a little pink in there, just to give it a little warmth in the background, I dont want much. Dont want much, I still want it to have a distinct winter taste to it. There we are"
Bob Ross,"OK, well just play some of that right down to the edge of that pink. And thats basically all it takes. There, blend it a little bit. And thats good enough"
Bob Ross,"Thatll give us a sky that, as I said, has a little life in it, and some action is happening, its not just a flat ol dead sky, you can see it light areas. And I like that in a sky"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, thats working pretty good. Maybe well do the same thing down here, doesnt matter. Anything that we dont, dont use, we just turn it into a shadow"
Bob Ross,"If this is a winter scene maybe well have some snow, you gotta have shadows in the snow. Or maybe itll turn out to be water. Who knows, it doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"Doesnt matter, because we can fix anything that can happen here, we dont, we dont concern ourselves with mistakes, we just have happy accidents. There. See. Something about like it"
Bob Ross,"And thats a good way to clean the excess paint off your brush. Mkay, lets wash the ol brush now. If youve painted with me before you know thats really the fun part of this"
Bob Ross,"Its really the fun part, just washing the brush. There. beating laughs Isnt that fun. I usually just wipe the brush on a paper towel to assure its dry as I can possibly get it"
Bob Ross,"But, youd be surprised at how dry it gets just from beating it like that. Lets take black, Purssian blue, little touch of crimson. Black, blue, crimson, and Im going to get some white"
Bob Ross,"Just take a little bit of white. Im gonna mix up, hmm, put a little more blue in there. Yeah. Want it to have sort of a blue cast to it. Ooo, I like it. I like that, thats looking good"
Bob Ross,"Maybe a little more white. You just mix it till it gets to the flavor you like. And I think thats wonderful. Its sort of a drab blue color, its not real bright. There, thats a nice winter color"
Bob Ross,"All right, lets grab an old brush and load it full of color. We use the ol fan brush today. Maybe in our world, back here, somewhere in the background, see this color is not"
Bob Ross,far away from the color thats already on the canvas. Lets just push upward today and make us a little tree
Bob Ross,"There, thats pretty close to the color thats on the canvas, and thats what were looking for, I dont want it to be too much farther away. Pretty close, pretty close. All right"
Bob Ross,"There, maybe a little tree right there. And you decide how many trees live in your world, its up to you, totally and completely up to you"
Bob Ross,"As youve probably heard me say before, to me thats whats so fantastic about painting. Its that each and every person will paint differently, and thats what makes it special"
Bob Ross,"If we all painted the same way, what a boring time it would be. You would know what the finished painting was gonna be before you start"
Bob Ross,"But because people are different, paintings are different, thats the beauty of it. Thats what makes it very special. It allows you to show your individuality. There. How many trees do we want here"
Bob Ross,"Its up to you, you decide. You decide, maybe you wanna a whole forest, maybe you just want a few. Maybe theres a little baby one right there. Hes not so big yet"
Bob Ross,"Make up little stories, you know, people look at you like youre a little strange, but thats all right. Painters are expected to be different. Lets have one more right there. One more"
Bob Ross,"As I say painters are, painters are unique. I take advantage of that all the time too. Now then"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna take the ol two-inch brush, I wanna create the illusion of mist down here at the base of this. The illusion of mist"
Bob Ross,"So just by tapping, and were just going to softly, softly disappear over here. I want these trees to just sorta look like theyre just sitting in a little misty area. Just breathing in the cold air"
Bob Ross,"There we go. Something like that. But now we have a whole bunch of trees in the background, its very misty, cold looking, and already you have the impression of winter. That easy. All right"
Bob Ross,"Lets get a clean two-inch brush, time to have some fun. Lets have us a little snow in here. And to paint snow with a two-inch brush, very easy. Load it full of color. Full of titanium white"
Bob Ross,"And we have, we already have this grey color on the canvas, we, we put on and talked about it being like a shadow. Now, its gonna pick that up. See there. And we just let it sorta disappear over here"
Bob Ross,"We dont care. We dont care. That easy. But isnt that fantastic. Snow is one of the easier things to paint in this technique. OK. You ready for a little, a little fun today"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, tell you what, we film this show in Indian and theres a, theres a lot of old barns here that just fascinate me. Lets paint an old barn today"
Bob Ross,"One of the easiest ways is to take a, scrape out a basic shape, just sorta scrape it out. It doesnt have to be exact, and youre not committed. Youre not committed here"
Bob Ross,"So lets just decide what kind of old barn we want. Maybe it comes down like that, maybe it has a place over here for the cow to sleep. It doesnt matter, you decide, barns come in all kinds of shapes"
Bob Ross,"Farmers are like painters, they, they do it thier way. Yeah, thats whats so great about being a farmer in this fantastic country. You can do it your way. All right"
Bob Ross,"Have a lot of friends here that are farmers. Have to get a brownie point in with them, cause they got the best food, and I like to eat. All right, on the other side, about the same distance here"
Bob Ross,"Well just scrape out. I hope you can see, theres just a basic, basic shape there. And, as I mentioned earlier, you are not committed. Van dyke brown, dark sienna"
Bob Ross,"You can change your mind at this point. Little roll of paint. Now lets begin picking out the little things in here. Theres the back eave. see there. That easy. OK, now then"
Bob Ross,"The ol barn comes down, bloop-bloop-bloop-bloop. Gotta make those noises. There it is, see. All were doing here is blocking in a little color"
Bob Ross,"Well come back and do a barnectomy after a while, and cut it off wherever we want it. But right now all were doing is putting in the dark. Putting in some dark color. There. Here we go, bloop, bloop"
Bob Ross,"See there. Sorry I make those little noises, I sorta forget, cause I really do make em even when Im by myself I make little noises. Sorta makes things work better for me"
Bob Ross,"All right, and over here toop. There we go. See. Thats really about all were looking for to block it in. And right in here would be a little dark paint"
Bob Ross,"OK, now, lets take, lets take, lets take some white, dark sienna, a little vandyke in there, maybe even a little crimson too, what the heck. Give it a little warm feeling. Dont over mix the paint"
Bob Ross,"Cut off a littl roll of paint, then we can go up in here and just barely touch, just let it graze, see. Let it graze. Looks like old, old wood"
Bob Ross,"If youve painted barns and cabins and stuff before, you know I, I really like to paint old things. Im an avid collector of antique glass, for example. I like old things"
Bob Ross,"When you get to my age you have a tendency to like old things, you can relate to them. chuckles There we are. And I am old, older than dirt"
Bob Ross,"laughing Lets take a little, a little vandyke brown and I want to darken that color. so that its darker over here on the side, cause maybe not as much lights gonna hit over here. See"
Bob Ross,Thats much darker. Now then
Bob Ross,"Lets put some boards in there, for that well just take some van dyke brown, and well just put the indication here and there of some little boards, some slabs that live in here. There. See there"
Bob Ross,"I wish the barn was this easy to build for real. My father was a carpenter and I built a few barns, its not this easy. There. Its not this easy. There we are, something about like that. Now then"
Bob Ross,"We need a roof on this barn, so the cow dont get cold. Lets take some titanium white. Since we said this was winter, maybe the snow is there"
Bob Ross,"Lets just outline it so that way youll get a nice straight edge when you pull it down, watch. makes swooshing noise See there. There we go, now then. Little more of the white"
Bob Ross,makes swooshing noise Little touch more. makes swooshing noise There. There we go. Aint that neat. Looks like snows piled up on top of the ol barn
Bob Ross,"Little bit over there, cause youd see some on that side too. You would also see some here. And, oh, we got a whole section to go here. There, let me get some more white. Same thing though"
Bob Ross,"I want to outline it a little bit so youll have a nice, straight edge. And then when you pull it some, nice straight edge. There we go. Something about like that. Mkay. There"
Bob Ross,"But you can just move it, pull it, work it any way that you want to. All right, we need a door. OK, always gotta have a way to get in and out there"
Bob Ross,"Lets take some van dyke, decide where your door lives and makes swooshing noise Once again, dont worry about the bottom, were gonna do, were gonna do a barnectomy, as I mentioned earlier"
Bob Ross,"well cut this rascal off wherever we want it to be. Which is about time to do now. Lets say the ol barn, right along in there. See"
Bob Ross,"Didnt take too much cutting on that one, sometimes I paint em where I have to cut a lot off the bottom, because I get carried away"
Bob Ross,"Get carried away, get telling stories and things begin just looking good and I dont know when to stop. All right. That gives us a pretty nice, little barn. There it is. Lets find our two-inch brush"
Bob Ross,"Ol two inch brush. Its got a little snow on it, a little snow. Lets go up in here, and well put another plane, come right in there. makes swishing noise There we are"
Bob Ross,"Watch that brown snow, you know what they say about it. There we are. Down in there. Over here on the other side well just bring it right up. Like that. And got a little snow around his foots"
Bob Ross,"That easy. Once again, snow is so easy to paint when youre using a big ol two-inch brush. So easy to paint. Let me find a clean fan brush, theres one. Looks pretty good"
Bob Ross,"Find us a place to work on the ol palette. Gotta have a big palette, big palettes very, very helpful. Its almost as important as having a, well as having"
Bob Ross,"an easel that holds your paint firmly, your painting firmly. When youre using the two-inch brushes. you really need a good, firm. easel, a large palette. Itll pay you tremendous dividends"
Bob Ross,"Mix up some color here right on the brush. Little Prussian blue, black, brown, a little crimson. All them good colors. Maybe. OK. chuckles Here we go. Maybe right here"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna put a little paint thinner, just to thin the paint, its a little thick. When you paint just a little bit, pretty soon you begin to get a feel for it when it touches, if it dont wanna"
Bob Ross,"pull just right, then you can add a little thinner. But not, dont do that unless you have to. I just knew the paint wasnt gonna come off the brush unless I did"
Bob Ross,"Im gonna have a happy little tree, he lives right there, just a little guy. A little guy. Right on the side of the barn. Lets go on the other side over here"
Bob Ross,"You know me chuckles, bravery test, here we go. Bigger tree, big ol tree. I like these evergreens. Theyre so much fun to make. And theyre very simple, very, very simple"
Bob Ross,"Takes a little practice like anything else, everything in your life takes a little practice. But you can learn to paint this technique faster than any painting technique that I have ever seen"
Bob Ross,And I think Ive tried just about all of them. There. And oils. are so forgiving. And they possess a richness that no other medium possesses. I think thats why the old masters painted mostly in oils
Bob Ross,"They just have a, a richness. Other mediums to me are very flat when theyre dry. There. And theyre harder. This is the easiest, because its very forgiving, you cant make a mistake here"
Bob Ross,"All right, lets take, lets take some of that nice grey color we had. Maybe right in here, maybe theres a little, maybe theres a little path that just works its way out. Just works its way out here"
Bob Ross,"Something about like that. We just put some grey in there so, makes swooshing noise can come right on, right on out. Now then. Put some highlights on our little evergreens"
Bob Ross,"Let me clean off another spot. Running outta room today. Running outta room. There we go. Now, Ill take. liquid white, titanium white, and phthalo blue"
Bob Ross,"I change the blue, Ive been using Prussian blue. through the entire painting, now I want to use phthalo blue, because I want to highlight these trees and the phthalo blue will stand out a little bit"
Bob Ross,"Just want it to, to stand out. This is a blue spruce, I just made a decision. Command level decision, right here. See. You decide what kind of tree lives in your world. All right"
Bob Ross,"Mix up a little more of that phthalo blue and white. Dont want to have that little, dont want to have that little tree left out right there. Hey, you have to decide which tree is in the foreground"
Bob Ross,"I think the small one here is. So you do the one behind him first. Hows that. See. And mumbles little tree over here. Dont forget him, hell get sad. Hell get sad"
Bob Ross,"Well give him a little color on here. There we are. See. That easy. That easy. Mkay. Lets try here, little bit of titanium white"
Bob Ross,"Allow it to pick up some of that color, allow it to pick it up intentionally. So that way, you get all these different things happening. There. OK. Isnt this neat"
Bob Ross,"These whole winter scenes are a lot of fun, and I really think they might be the easiest ones to do. There we are. And we just blend that a little bit till it looks nice and soft and. pretty"
Bob Ross,"And this little tree over here. Im intentionally grabbing some of that dark color. See. Well put him up on a little hill, sorta. That easy. See. He sorta sits up high. Isnt that neat"
Bob Ross,"That just by pulling some of that color that you can create that illusion. Its unbelievable to have this kind of power. Unbelievable. There we go. All right, see the little path"
Bob Ross,"Its coming right along there, maybe. makes swooshing noise There we go. You just decide where your little path is. There we are. And you can take your fan brush that has the grey on it"
Bob Ross,"and just polish the edges up a little bit, however you want them. We can just go back and forth, work this until it, until it gets just what we consider perfect"
Bob Ross,"And sometimes its nice to, well just pop in a little mumbles here, then lift up. Lift it up. Make it look like little bushes and weeds living there"
Bob Ross,"Maybe theres one coming right here, I dont know. You decide. You decide where they are. But you have little patches of bushes and sticks, and wigs. Limbs and twigs that grow everywhere. There we go"
Bob Ross,"See. All right. Well just use that same brush. Ready to get crazy. Lets take some van dyke brown, mostly van dyke brown, theres a little black on the brush, I think. It doesnt matter"
Bob Ross,"In our world, in our world. You ready for your bravery test. OK, here it comes. makes swooshing noises There. OK, lets give him a friend. Lets give him a friend. makes zooming noises There"
Bob Ross,"Something about like it. Or, maybe, maybe this is an old birch tree that lives out here. Its up to you. You could make him a birch or whatever. You can have an old oak tree if you wanted to"
Bob Ross,"Doesnt matter. There. Something like so. There we are. You know, its hard to believe, this is the 31st series of The Joy of Painting. Good gosh, theres over 400 shows now, its almost unreal"
Bob Ross,Almost. I want to thank you for. allowing us to come to you for this long. Weve been doing this show now for well over 11 years
Bob Ross,"11 years, and youve made me feel very special to invite me into your home and to let me be part of your family. Thank you very much"
Bob Ross,"If you hadnt get to see all the shows in your area and you would like to, give your station a call, theyre available to them. Theyre available to them"
Bob Ross,"Or if you want to see some of them over again, let them know. Its the only way theyd know. Little brown with paint thinner here, and just gonna put on some little limbs"
Bob Ross,"Its too cold for there to be any leaves on here. They went, they went to Florida for the winter"
Bob Ross,"No, leaves dont go to Florida, they just fall off the tree, I know, somebodyll write and tell me theyre not there. Hmm. There we go. Anywhere you want them to be. Anywhere"
Bob Ross,"Just paint thinner, and off you go. There, see. And dont worry about whats behind it. When you, when you paint it, just paint, dont worry about it. Nature didnt worry, you dont worry"
Bob Ross,"OK, few more little limbs here. Shoot, I think were about, about to the point where we got this rascal. looking pretty good. Maybe, maybe theres a little stick right in there, I dunno. Hmm"
Bob Ross,"Maybe, lets go right over in here. Maybe over in here we can put the indication of just. a few little twigs and sticks and things that are living everywhere. Something about that that"
Bob Ross,"Shoot, I think with that we gone have a finished painting. Lets take a little red, and well sign this rascal. Really hope youve enjoyed this little painting, I hope youll try it"
Bob Ross,"Itll give you a lot of experience using the equipment, and with experience comes confidence, and with confidence, you know you can do anything that you believe you can do"
Bob Ross,"From all of us here until next time, Id like to wish you happy painting, and God bless my friend. mellow music"
Bob Ross,welcome back im certainly glad you could join us today today is the last show of the 31st series so lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along
Bob Ross,with us while theyre doing that let me show you what ive got done today today ive taken my standard old canvas and i use an 18 by 24 inch but you use whatever size is convenient and ive taken a
Bob Ross,little black and gray gesso and a foam brush just a disposable foam brush and i just sort of painted in a little scene here to make these little effects i just took a natural sponge and just dabbed a
Bob Ross,little bit thats all there is to it let that dry completely and then weve covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of liquid clear so its all wet and ready to go and ill show you a nice way
Bob Ross,of making a just a gorgeous little painting thats very simple lets start out today im going to start with a small amount of the indian yellow dont need much just a little on the two inch brush and
Bob Ross,in yellow is very transparent so we can just paint right over everything it doesnt matter doesnt matter just let it go like something there like that thats all maybe a little touch of yellow ochre
Bob Ross,right above it just to change the flavor a little bit and then ill go into a little bit of the bright red now you decide what colors you want to use how strong you want them to be or how weak its up
Bob Ross,to you up to you there something about like that maybe my touch of alizarin crimson right like there but just let it go and were just making little little crisscross strokes very easy okay once again
Bob Ross,all these colors were using are transparent enough that you can still see the gesso right through them its no big deal youre not going to hurt a thing just paint right over anything thats in your
Bob Ross,way saying already we have a pretty nice looking little sky okay i want to mix up uh well take some phthalo blue crimson phthalo blue and crimp so ill make a little lavendery color but i want this
Bob Ross,to be to the crimson side so i put many times more crimson in it than blue there the blue is much much stronger than crimson okay now lets take a little bit of that color sure we didnt have to wash
Bob Ross,the brush yet and well go right up in here and lets just fill in the rest of the sky something about like that this is just a lavender color very pretty were painting right over liquid clear there
Bob Ross,we are be sure your brush is dry and free of paint thinner when youre doing this liquid clear and paint thinner have a violent reaction so you dont want to put them together be sure your brush is as
Bob Ross,dry as you can possibly get it okay maybe just a touch more of that i like it there okay that is a beautiful color i like lavender i really like lavender purple whatever you want to call it blue and
Bob Ross,crimson thats what it is now then time to wash the old brush and thats the part thats most fun okay scrub the old brush and odorless paint thinner and well take and shake off the excess and beat
Bob Ross,the devil out of it okay lets have some fun lets take a little bit of titanium white im just going to tap a little right onto one corner of the brush thats all there is to it just tap a little
Bob Ross,lets go up in here and well start right at the edge of this mountain with that titanium white and begin working up my titanium white is very opaque its very opaque but when you have it this thin
Bob Ross,its thin enough to still let a little bit of that show through there see we can pull it like theres a sun rays coming through there we are just like it just gives the impression that theres a
Bob Ross,beautiful glow going on back here okay wash the old brush off get it good and dry now then lets have some fun down here thats about all im going to do for the sky i want this to to look like its
Bob Ross,just bathed in light and itll give that impression that easy okay now then down in here got to decide what were going to do we got some that lavender color thats sort of pretty lets just cover
Bob Ross,some of this lets just cover it put a little bit of that down there so we have a base color and well stop it right along in there we dont want that to get up into the sky just put that on there
Bob Ross,that so when we when we put highlights on all this itll pick up some of that color i need to mix up a little more i didnt make enough phthalo blue and alizarin crimson and thats all there is to it
Bob Ross,just just mix it up doesnt have to be well mixed its good enough good enough now theres a couple of big old trees here we can go ahead and sort of block those in see the basic shapes already there
Bob Ross,it takes very little color just enough to to create some little arms on him and thats all you need hey we better not leave him out he get upset there we go something about like it all right now we
Bob Ross,got all of that blocked in all of us covered with a little bit of lavender and were ready to go i have to start making big decisions now okay let me grab another old two inch brush i have several of
Bob Ross,them going here lets take a little sap green a little of the yellow little yellow ochre all those yellows mixed together with a little sap green there well just make all kinds of beautiful colors
Bob Ross,mix them on the brush though tap push give it a little push okay lets go up in here now back in back in here we want to start yeah now you could do this with a one inch brush if you would like can do
Bob Ross,easy there see i just want to start putting the impression of all kinds of little deuters that are happening around there just change the flavor a little bit every now and then darks already there so
Bob Ross,you dont have to worry about it you dont have to worry about it theres a little tree that lives back in there these are far away just little soft trees that live back in there a little red every
Bob Ross,now and then there see it gives it sort of a sort of an autumn feel all right maybe over here theres another one boy theres one thats really red its bright red thats okay its okay in our world
Bob Ross,we can have any color we want because were the boss we can do it all all right now then lets start figuring out whats happening down here just take touch and begin tapping just begin tapping its
Bob Ross,picking up that color that we put on the canvas underneath there and the more you tap it the more itll itll pick it up in the color will just get darker and darker automatically so you have to make
Bob Ross,the big decision how dark you want it to be im just varying some of the colors when i go away putting on a little bit of the yellows and the greens but think about the lay of the land the way the
Bob Ross,land flows i want the land to look like its coming like that so thats what well do if you have trouble making it stick add a little bit of paint thinner before you go through the paint to load your
Bob Ross,brush let me repeat one word in there though little bit takes very very little dont put much in there a little goes a long long way long long way okay well look at there look there and that neat you
Bob Ross,can do this you really truly can do it a little practice off you go shoot now like they already have a lot of depth a lot of dip i know what im gonna let me show you let me show you im sorry i get
Bob Ross,excited sometimes i want to pull this tree down now you said bobby really cracked up now but watch i know its hard to see against all that dark but ive decided that tree should be in the foreground
Bob Ross,we had him in the background and we moved him because in our world we can move trees we can bend rivers anything that we want to do there lets see all kinds of little deuters i didnt paint over here
Bob Ross,very well so well just put a tree there sort of fill that hole up trees are wonderful for that there we go hey looks like a little metal back here now okay just let your imagination take you to any
Bob Ross,land that you want to live in any place that you want to go all right shoot thats looking pretty good there lets take our little script liner brush take a little brown little brown let me put a
Bob Ross,little white over there too now we got a little brown little white im gonna make a a very thin thin paint here very thin okay maybe ill even put a little black to gray it oh thats perfect kings go
Bob Ross,up in here now in our world theres an old tree trunk in there now if your hands a little nervous and you got a little shake this is a time to use it that way you dont end up with just a plain old
Bob Ross,trunk in your tree put something there thats got some some interest to it and then were going to cover most of it up with leaves but some of itll show some of it will show this old tree says i want
Bob Ross,one too there see you decide you decide where they are there maybe your maybe your tree dont even have any trunk in it maybe you cant see it we know it has it but maybe you cant see it thats up to
Bob Ross,you too any way that you want it to be is just right there maybe well give him one more little arm run over here to hold up that old that old area all right now then lets begin to figure out where
Bob Ross,these old trees are take a little the yellow little sap green everyone smile im going to touch it a little bit of red okay lets go up in here lets do this one yeah start right up in here and just
Bob Ross,begin putting the impression of some little leaves on there that live right out in there right out there a little more paint on the brush there we are dont be afraid to stop and load the brush
Bob Ross,frequently just like we do here sometimes you have to load it several times during one tree thats okay thats okay were not in any hurry well im in a hurry as you know i got amino director back
Bob Ross,here there we are i should talk about my amino director a little bit shes really a very nice person and i pick on her because she deserves it this whole crew here where we filmed the show some of the
Bob Ross,best people ive ever met and id like to thank them i dont do that often enough because without them there would be no joy of painting they are the best there we are see got a little happy tree
Bob Ross,right there right there lets go over here im gonna change the flavor a little put a little red in there spruce it up some lets go right up in here well put something on this little tree you dont
Bob Ross,want to be left out i guess this is a big old tree but use just the corner just the corner of the brush thats all you need dont want to hit it full face on just just the corner and if you have a lot
Bob Ross,of paint and its thinner than whats up there itll come right off your brush and itll work so well i think the greatest thing about this style of painting it has allowed every person every person
Bob Ross,whos ever wanted to put a dream on canvas to do just that you dont have to be blessed by michelangelo dont have to go to school half your life you can paint and you can do a real nice job of it
Bob Ross,there and i got another little tree done now all we got to do is start picking out the little things here and there ill add the least little touch of paint thinner least little touch you might even
Bob Ross,tap it on a paper towel make sure you got all the excess out can always go back and add a little more okay a little more of the color and off we go now well start picking out individuals here
Bob Ross,individuals there we are theres a happy little bush he lives right there boy what a view he has thats where i want to live right there thats the spot i think he has the best view in there yeah i
Bob Ross,lived in alaska for over 12 years and some of the most beautiful scenery in the world is there absolutely as i mentioned earlier this is the last show of the 31st series so its always sort of a sad
Bob Ross,time when it comes to the last show but hopefully well have the opportunity to produce some more and if you hadnt got a chance to see all of them because theres over 400 shows now do give your
Bob Ross,station a call let them know that you want to see them because theyre available to them they are available to them there we are see im just putting layers and layers and layers of bushes and this is
Bob Ross,where all the mosquitoes live like that there this good place for my little squirrel to live right here my little pea pot i got one more piece of film i want to show you hes just such a cute little
Bob Ross,devil isnt he something else this is pea pod to pocket squirrel there i really like these little creatures they bring a lot of joy to my life a lot of joy where i live a lot of the a lot of the young
Bob Ross,people come over just to see the animals see what kind of creatures bobs got that day and its such a nice way you cant you cant handle a little squirrel like that and grow up and not like them i
Bob Ross,dont believe you can and i think we need to learn to respect nature and all of gods little creatures and one of the ways that i like to do it is to bring you little characters like him yeah because
Bob Ross,hed be cute well thats a close up and a half there little devil sometimes i have eight or ten of them at one time that im raising and then ill turn them loose and we have a few little wild birds
Bob Ross,and all kind of things like that whatever needs to be raised and taken care of well do it its my way of saying thank you because a little squirrel or whatever you happen to have he allows you to
Bob Ross,share a little bit of his world for a few days and thats very special not many people get to do that lets go up here in this little bush ive got all these done were you just looking at the squirrel
Bob Ross,there little tree right here we decided hes hanging around having a good time there he goes there he go its hard to believe you can take a two inch brush and do all this in it take a little phthalo
Bob Ross,blue and put in there to make a very bright green one itll hurt your eyes dont want a lot of it but a little bit here and there makes a nice green if youre doing springtime very nice green put a
Bob Ross,little more paint thinner on my brush just to get the paint a little thinner but it needs to be just a small amount dont dont dont overdo dont overdo it i know i get excited but i want it to work
Bob Ross,for you its most important to me that this works for you i wanna i saw its just a natural place for a path bandaid brown dark sienna yeah a little roll of paint on the knife and lets go up in here
Bob Ross,and lets just lets put us in some brown paint and lets make a path we need a way to walk back it looks like a little metal that lives back in there and we need a way to get back in there i like to
Bob Ross,i like to run through the map take my shoes off just just let your foots run naked through there thats that feels good on the bottom of your feet have you ever done that most people have it one time
Bob Ross,or another theyll admit it publicly or not theyve just taken their shoes off and ran through meadow and i like it okay lets take some white some white a little van dyke brown a little dark sienna
Bob Ross,mix them together put a little touch of bright red in there too yeah maybe a little more i like that i like that yeah experiment just do crazy things whats the worst thing can happen on this canvas
Bob Ross,nothing little roll of paint little roll of paint barely barely touching just let it graze just let it graze just like youre laying snow on the mountain but in this neat using the the black and the
Bob Ross,gray gesso sure makes painting easier we introduced black gesso and gray gesso quite a while back and it has almost become a standard in the art world now almost as standard i think i think
Bob Ross,everybodys using it now there lets take a little bit more of the of this green color notice its very thin its very thin now then i want to set that down into the painting so well begin to put
Bob Ross,bushes that come up over it distinctly up over the path and that will push that little rascal right down in there there we go wherever wherever little bright red and well just drop in some little
Bob Ross,deuters there something like so you know ive mentioned before in this series that if you have time take a picture of what youre doing send to us we would love to see what what youre doing what kind
