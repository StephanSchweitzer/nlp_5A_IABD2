0,holt,Now don't let me interrupt. You were describing what kind of person I'm gonna be. I'd like you to finish.
1,holt,Now do the robot voice.
2,holt,The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot. I wanna hear it again.
3,holt,That's a terrible robot voice.
4,holt,"The next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie."
5,holt,"Well, your new Captain does. And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders.Everyone, I'm your new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt."
6,holt,That was my speech.
7,holt,"Sergeant Jeffords, a word."
8,holt,"Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me. Though you were significantly..."
9,holt,"Titties, yes. I remember. I never liked that nickname. Though to be fair, it was accurate. What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave?"
10,holt,They have adorable chubby cheeks.
11,holt,Tell me about your Detective squad.
12,holt,Copy that.
13,holt,Tell me about Peralta.
14,holt,That was very well put.
15,holt,"Look, you know my history. You know how important this is to me. This precinct is doing fine, but I wanna make it the best one in Brooklyn. And I need your help."
16,holt,We start with him.
17,holt,"Speaking of ties, where's yours, Meep Morp?"
18,holt,I like to know what my detectives are up to. That okay by you?
19,holt,Take Santiago and knock on doors. See if the neighbors heard anything.
20,holt,Diaz and Boyle. Check in the coroner. Report back to me in an hour.
21,holt,"No, it didn't."
22,holt,So Gina. Civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground. What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?
23,holt,How about this? If you tell me-
24,holt,I won't have you suspended without pay.
25,holt,"No, that's enough, Gina."
26,holt,"That's enough, Gina."
27,holt,Thank you.
28,holt,"All right, hit the pawn shops and canvass the neighborhood. And while you're out, you can buy yourself a tie."
29,holt,"First of all, I think you're kind of overdoing it with the manscaping. But more importantly, Detective, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously? Does anyone here know why it's so important to me that you all dress appropriately? Hmm. Four highly trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery. I wanna be briefed on any new developments. Any questions?"
30,holt,"It's over, disco man! Put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl"
31,holt,"So you found something? Hey, I like the tie."
32,holt,"That's fine work, Detective."
33,holt,"You know what, such fine police work, let's share it with the whole team. Santiago! Boyle! Diaz! Get in here! Bring everyone! And a camera!"
34,holt,"Of the fine master Detective, Jake Peralta."
35,holt,"Yeah, let's have a hand, everyone. Give him a hand."
36,holt,Does he always talk this much?
37,holt,Because I'm gay.
38,holt,Seriously? I'm surprised you didn't know. I don't try to hide it.
39,holt,Manscaping.
40,holt,"About 25 years ago. The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay Detective. But then the old guard died out. Suddenly, they couldn't wait to show off the fact that they had a highly ranking gay officer. I made Captain. But they put me in a public affairs unit. I was a good soldier. I helped recruitment. But all I ever really wanted was my own command. And now I finally got it. And I'm not gonna screw it up."
41,holt,Looks like we all got door duty.
42,holt,Clear. Clear.
43,holt,"Maybe now's not the best time, Detective."
44,holt,"Yes, you did. Now just arrest Ratko. All right, Ratko, down. Drop the weapon. Hands on your head. Here we go.  Hey!"
45,holt,What's wrong with you?
46,holt,"You're three minutes late, Peralta."
47,holt,"Good idea. Everyone? Gather round, so I can call out Peralta in front of you."
48,holt,"Oh, it's more than one thing."
49,holt,Let's start with the Kristov murder.
50,holt,"You also mislabeled the evidence, so that confession is worthless if the sergeant hadn't caught your mistake. Here are three cases with sloppy paperwork. Here are two pictures. One is your locker. The other is a garbage dump in the Philippines. Can you tell which is which?"
51,holt,They're both your locker.
52,holt,"This folder is labeled ""undies, dirty.”"
53,holt,You also have more mice living in your desk than any other detective.
54,holt,"Get rid of the mouse, and get your act together now."
55,holt,I assume you have a plan to catch this gentleman.
56,holt,"That's a good idea, sergeant. We'll take the van."
57,holt,It's not backup. It's babysitting.
58,holt,You were late again.
59,holt,Angry Captain.
60,holt,I'm just concerned that you may find it hard to pursue a criminal on foot while wearing man sandals.
61,holt,You think I wanna be sitting here with you instead of running my precinct?
62,holt,"It was a rhetorical question. I've spent the last 12 years fighting for my first command, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up because you refuse to take your job seriously."
63,holt,"Well, so does doing your paperwork, showing up on time, wearing proper footwear."
64,holt,"Well, so here's the deal. You're gonna have a superior officer babysitting you on every one of your cases. And when you show me that you can do your job... Every part of your job... Perfectly, then I'll back off."
65,holt,"It's ""more perfectly."" You said that imperfectly."
66,holt,"Police, freeze!"
67,holt,Already got him.
68,holt,"Good, I'm anxious to read it."
69,holt,"Anything else, Detective?"
70,holt,"Deputy Commissioner’s son, huh? His decision to target cop cars makes a lot more sense now."
71,holt,"He defaced nine police vehicles, and you caught him red-handed. Why would you let him walk?"
72,holt,"You’re the arresting office. It’s your call. I told you to do every part of your job, and making this call is part of your job."
73,holt,Mm-hmm.
74,holt,Mm-hmm.
75,holt,Yes.
76,holt,Why is there yogurt on this?
77,holt,Terry loves yogurt.Something wrong?
78,holt,"No, I wouldn’t say he was lucky. I feel bad for this kid. I mean, what kind of father cares so little for his son that he lets him get away with everything? Well, he’s someone else’s problem now. Like you said, it’s out of your hands."
79,holt,You want backup?
80,holt,"Commissioner, please don’t talk to my detective in that tone. If you have a complaint, you can take it up with me."
81,holt,"You’re gonna have to try a little harder if you wanna scare me. I’ve been an openly gay cop since 1987, so you’re not the first superior officer to threaten me. You know how I’m still standing here? ‘Cause I do my job, and I do it right."
82,holt,Don’t say “son.”
83,holt,"Alright, let’s get this meeting started."
84,holt,"You’re out of uniform, Peralta."
85,holt,"Peralta, where are we on the Adams Street burglary?"
86,holt,And the Vickers Street aggravated assault?
87,holt,I'm concerned that the open cases mound of garbage on your desk has become so much higher than the closed cases mound of garbage.
88,holt,Formula 1 or Stock?
89,holt,You got speed bumps on a race track?
90,holt,What did I say about doing voices?
91,holt,"Yes, the D. A. wanted me to personally thank you for your work on the Jay Street drug bust."
92,holt,For praise?
93,holt,There's a community outreach program that's very important to me. I was wondering if you'd like to head it up.
94,holt,Be more articulate when you speak to the children.
95,holt,"It looks like this case remains unsolved, Peralta."
96,holt,What's going on in here?
97,holt,"Or try working a case until it's solved, Peralta. I always find that closing cases is the best way to end the slump."
98,holt,"So, where are you going, Peralta?"
99,holt,"So you haven't solved any of your old cases, and yet you've taken on a new one. I mean, shouldn't you at least solve this Helen Sterrino missing grandmother case first?"
100,holt,You're dripping on my carpet.
101,holt,Why would I ever eat off his shirt?
102,holt,"Cursed, huh?"
103,holt,"Yeah, I've seen this kind of thing before. It happened to a friend of mine back in the 1-8. Detective Smith. We called him Smitty. He thought he was cursed, and because cops are superstitious, the whole precinct thought he was cursed."
104,holt,"No. No one would go out on calls with him. He responded to a riot at a gym without backup, and got beaten up by a girls' volleyball team. It was actually quite violent."
105,holt,"I don't want you out in the field again, Peralta. I'm pulling you from casework. You can digitize old files with Scully."
106,holt,"No, I don't think that's what's best for you or the squad. Not until this blows over."
107,holt,"Could be a week, could be a month."
108,holt,"Peralta, leave Hitchcock alone! Come here. I got in touch with Smitty. He says that you should rub this rabbit's foot with your left forefinger and your pinky, like this, for good luck. Okay? Now you try it."
109,holt,"Rub, rub, rub."
110,holt,Take the rabbit's foot.
111,holt,Detectives. I see we got eight recruits for the Junior Police Program. Outstanding.
112,holt,"Or... I can give you a zero percent raise and make you my personal assistant, which is what I'm doing. I think you have hidden talents, which will make you surprisingly good at the job."
113,holt,You start Monday.
114,holt,Permission denied.
115,holt,"So, the rabbit's foot worked, huh?"
116,holt,"All talented detectives haves their ups and downs, Peralta."
117,holt,You know why Boyle doesn't slump?
118,holt,"Because he doesn't let adversity get him down. He keeps grinding. If I'd given you those new cases, the second you hit a snag, you would have spiraled again. You need to stay out of your own head."
119,holt,"Well, there's a very good reason for that. I was, uh, I believe the term is, uh... messing with you."
120,holt,"Peralta, you want to loop everyone in?"
121,holt,That was not a request.
122,holt,Is that reason that they want to win the case?
123,holt,"Well, find it. The family's close to the mayor, and I'm catching heat from the higher-ups. I'm gonna ask you again. Do you need any resources or personnel?"
124,holt,"Okay. Dismissed! Sergeant Jeffords, my office."
125,holt,"Terry, I'd like you to accompany me to a gun range."
126,holt,"I spent eight years in the public affairs office, so my tactical skills are a little rusty. I need some pointers."
127,holt,The mannequin incident... I'm familiar.
128,holt,Another incident?
129,holt,"You used to be the precinct's champion marksman. I only want to take pointers from the best. So I'll keep it low-key. We'll go after work to a private range. No cops, no pressure."
130,holt,I told Gina she could join us.
131,holt,You live in our precinct.
132,holt,Major crimes is stepping in. Nothing I can do. You're off the case.
133,holt,"Yes, Boyle, I put that together from context. First of all, major crimes has jurisdiction over any and all cases they want to take. But more importantly, you're the one who insisted on working alone. I told you for weeks to use the squad, and you refused."
134,holt,"Oh, congratulations, Detective Boyle. You should've involved him sooner. Turn over your files to Detective Pembroke."
135,holt,Turn over the files.
136,holt,For both of us.
137,holt,"So my stance feels good, but I'm still not hitting center."
138,holt,"When I lock my shooting arm, the other hand feels unstable. Now, what stance am I supposed to be doing... Weaver or isosceles?"
139,holt,That was only seven.
140,holt,I know a way to watch porn in Korea.
141,holt,"You're too good a cop to be shackled to a desk. You only have one hit until you get recertified. So deep breath, huh? Take the final shot."
142,holt,"Take the shot, sergeant."
143,holt,You've had 18 minutes of seconds.
144,holt,"Peralta, why are you asking Gina about Detective Pembroke?"
145,holt,"Look, I understand that you're upset. But if you want to keep this from happening again, I suggest that you pull your team together and solve these cases before major crimes can step in. Am I clear?"
146,holt,"Still waiting, sergeant."
147,holt,You have a friend... Who's just a silhouette?
148,holt,"I've seen the film, sergeant."
149,holt,"Apparently, our Detective squad has gotten drunk, compromised the crime scene, and an officer has gotten stuck in a trash chute. I need you to lead this squad, Terry. And I mean really lead it. I hope you take the shot."
150,holt,"Would you like to sit down, Detective? You seem upset."
151,holt,Cracked the case all by yourself. We done here?
152,holt,"No! All of you broke into a crime scene under the influence of alcohol, overstepped your jurisdiction, and disobeyed my direct orders. Everyone involved tonight is gonna get written up."
153,holt,"okay, enough."
154,holt,"Well, Detective, I'm happy to see you're learning how to be part of a team. Everybody go home. Sleep it off."
155,holt,I know you will.
156,holt,"Are you sure Whitman did it?Jake:Yes, I'm positive.Holt:Then the whole team stays. We have a better shot with everyone on it.Jake:Fine, will you at least tell Hitchcock to go home? His mouth smells like rotten trout milk.Holt:Is there such a thing?Jake:I'm just telling you what it smells like.Holt:Get out."
157,holt,"Mr. Brogan, these are detectives Santiago and Peralta."
158,holt,"Mr. Brogan is writing an article about how Brooklyn detectives have changed in the 35 years since The Squad. He'll be observing the two of you on your lnternet identity theft case. I hope Mr. Brogan's presence doesn't prove to be a distraction to you, Peralta."
159,holt,None of that is true.
160,holt,There are no sweet mob-related homicides on which to jump.
161,holt,Why do you idolize that man and the time he wrote about?
162,holt,"The '70s were not a good time for the city or for the department... Corruption, brutality, sexism. Diaz and Santiago never would have made Detective, and an openly gay man like me... I never would have been given a command. There were very few black detectives. Did I ever tell you what my first day on the job was like?"
163,holt,Hello. I'm Raymond Holt.
164,holt,Some of them were legit. Some of them were just Brogan's drinking buddies.
165,holt,It wasn't an idea. It was a scathing indictment of your personal hero.
166,holt,You look like a corpse we just pulled out of the river.
167,holt,: I told you not to let Jimmy Brogan distract you from your work. So I assume you're not too hung over to do said work?
168,holt,And that's not a hangover cure.
169,holt,You punched Jimmy Brogan? What were you thinking?
170,holt,"Unbelievable. Every time I think you might make a decent Detective, you go and pull something like this."
171,holt,Go home! You got the rest of the day to put your head on straight.
172,holt,"Got Halbrook to cop to every charge. Nice work, Santiago."
173,holt,I sent him home. He assaulted Jimmy Brogan.
174,holt,Tell me what?
175,holt,"I'm disappointed in you, Santiago. I thought you and I were close."
176,holt,"Thank you, Santiago. That'll be all."
177,holt,"You can ignore that garbage, Santiago. Jimmy Brogan wouldn't know a legit cop if he punched him in the face."
178,holt,Good solve on the Herman Avenue burglaries. Finish up the paperwork as soon as possible.
179,holt,"No, that was actually a command. So my command is your command."
180,holt,"Why'd you target us with your computer virus, Corey?"
181,holt,"Use Gina. She's my assistant, and she has something to offer. Trust me."
182,holt,"I apologize, marshal Boone, for Detective Peralta's actions, something I find myself doing quite frequently."
183,holt,Why's it special?
184,holt,"Of course, it's the only one that measures mouth-feel."
185,holt,This isn't about pizza. What's it actually about?
186,holt,"Well, that's certainly not what I expected this to be about."
187,holt,"There, there. There, there. There."
188,holt,"So of all the candidates that you interviewed today, who do you think I should hire?"
189,holt,Why does that matter?
190,holt,Get to the point.
191,holt,There we have it.
192,holt,"Peralta, fire marshal Boone just called. He told me you should check your drawer?"
193,holt,I see we are once again at war with the fire department. You are not to retaliate.
194,holt,"OK, I'll be right there. (Ends call)"
195,holt,"I have to head back to the precinct. No. Why? Someone stole $10,000 from the evidence lockup."
196,holt,"Why is that awesome? It's a case. You said I could hop on any case that came up. It's a Thanksgiving miracle. Have fun, you guys. Let's roll! (Peralta and Holt leave)"
197,holt,You'd think that one place money would be safe is a police station.
198,holt,Good idea.
199,holt,"There were two men released from holding today that were the right height and weight to be our thief on the security footage. Even if it is one of them, how will we know?"
200,holt,"Peralta, take this seriously."
201,holt,Please refrain from make believe this time.
202,holt,Excuse me.
203,holt,"Excuse me, if..."
204,holt,My wife was murdered by a man in a yellow sweater! It's the one case I can't solve. Don't fight with family. It can all go away so quickly. Sign this? (Donny signs it)
205,holt,"Nice work, Peralta. So where's the money now?"
206,holt,This is not good.
207,holt,Our perp says the bookie operates out of a hidden back room. Try to blend in.
208,holt,"Oh, we're just looking around."
209,holt,The guy by the bathroom seems very interested in the commotion you just made.
210,holt,Let's go.
211,holt,"What, it's really a bathroom?"
212,holt,What?
213,holt,Put it down! (Moves in closer)
214,holt,"Put it down, put it down."
215,holt,The money was still in the bookie's safe. All the numbers match. Let's head back to Santiago's party.
216,holt,What's your problem with celebrating Thanksgiving?
217,holt,But the beauty of being an adult is that you can make a new family with new traditions.
218,holt,Okay. I'll tell the squad you couldn't make it.
219,holt,Hey. What are y'all doing here?
220,holt,Fascinating.
221,holt,Hm?
222,holt,; You think I'm like when you were a little girl?
223,holt,Is this about your toast? (Holds her age page toast)
224,holt,"Gina gave it to me. It's very well-written. There are several compelling anecdotes. The fonts suit the tone. Good work. (Shake hands) I do feel, however, the word choice could've been improved in spots. I marked them ""Awk"" for ""Awkward."""
225,holt,"Excuse me, everyone. As you may know, this holiday season. Detectives sometimes feel the urge to buy their captains holiday presents. Please refrain from doing that. Under no circumstances do I want a present."
226,holt,"Thank you for joining us, Peralta. This is Deputy Chief Gerber."
227,holt,Captains receive meaningless threats all the time. It’s not a big deal.
228,holt,"It’s a hoax. I don’t want to alarm the squad, so please keep this between us."
229,holt,Are you going to sit there all day?
230,holt,To use the restroom.
231,holt,Your constant hovering is going to draw attention to the situation. The last thing I want is for the rest of the precinct to get involved. I’m going home to work in peace.
232,holt,Do you know why I picked you to be my security escort?
233,holt,"I chose you because the threat is not real, and I thought you’d have no problem breaking the rules and letting me do my work. Now, let me go."
234,holt,Fine. We will go to your mother's place. I guess I am curious to see where this all started.
235,holt,That’s a bathroom.
236,holt,Why are there no pictures of you? And no
237,holt,Get out of my way. I’m leaving.
238,holt,"If you want me to stay, you’re going to have to physically stop me. Can you do that, Peralta? Didn’t think so"
239,holt,I told you the death threat was not serious. So: what. On Earth. Are you doing?
240,holt,Fine. But before we go into lockdown --
241,holt,I’d like to text my husband and tell him I’ll be coming home late.
242,holt,You’re not crafting the message.
243,holt,Give me my phone.
244,holt,"Welcome back, Detective."
245,holt,"Oh, you don't have to apologize for anything, Boyle. You were shot in the line of duty, defending a fellow officer."
246,holt,"Everyone here appreciates your heroism, Boyle. We all want your first day back to be as pleasant and as comfortable as possible. Right, detectives?"
247,holt,Ouch. You ran over my foot. I am in incredible pain.
248,holt,My husband's dogCheddarhad relations with our neighbor dog karate and produced these two smaller dogs he insisted that I find them a good home with someone we trust.
249,holt,"You're allergic to dogs, aren't you?"
250,holt,"Hand me the small dog, Santiago."
251,holt,How many cars would you say this Pontiac bandit has stolen?
252,holt,You're not very good at math. What are the charges against Judy?
253,holt,Do you need a math tutor? Because the department will provide one for you.
254,holt,I'm on the fence here. Diaz caught him. It's your call.
255,holt,"What's 1,000 push-ups?"
256,holt,Okay.Make the deal. Yes!
257,holt,"Sergeant, I'd like you to meet Richard and Dan. They are puppies."
258,holt,"Maybe your twins would like some little, furry friends."
259,holt,I understand.Just know you have disappointed... All three of us.
260,holt,"Boyle, where is everyone?"
261,holt,She live tweets everything. RuinedDownton Abbeyfor me.
262,holt,Huh.
263,holt,You're all hiding from Boyle.
264,holt,That's worse.
265,holt,That man took a b*llet for this precinct. He's a guy who's always looking for love and friendship. And he needs it now more than ever. But you all turned your backs on him. And you should all be ashamed of yourselves.
266,holt,Detective Boyle.I think you might be able to give these dogs a good home.
267,holt,"Are you crying, Santiago?"
268,holt,901.
269,holt,"This is one of the NYPD's highest honors. Today is your day, Detective Boyle."
270,holt,At least Boyle was announced first.
271,holt,"That's enough, Peralta. This is a huge honor, and nothing can take that away from him."
272,holt,"Attention.After today's shift, I'd like everyone join me at the bar for drinks in honor of Detective Boyle and his Medal of Valor."
273,holt,He's being feted by the united nations.As you were.
274,holt,I'm not gonna give you more cases so you can win your bet with Santiago.
275,holt,"Well, granted, this friendly competition has led to you and Santiago putting in more hours and arresting more perps, especially this last week."
276,holt,"Both of you have done exemplary work, which I appreciate."
277,holt,"However, you are colleagues, and the fallout from this bet has the potential to put a strain on your professional relationship."
278,holt,Cases will be assigned as they usually are.Dismissed.
279,holt,No.
280,holt,What's going on with Boyle?
281,holt,"Oh, that explains the elevator."
282,holt,"Gina, please keep an eye on Boyle today. He's gonna say something to the wrong person and get himself punched."
283,holt,Try again?
284,holt,Correct.
285,holt,"And you. Your husband is a real hero. If you ask me, he should've been up there with Detective Boyle today."
286,holt,For saving my life.
287,holt,"No, I was referring to how he threw his body at an emotionally disturbed criminal who was trying to k*ll me."
288,holt,Oh. I have caused a problem. I think I am... Getting a text message. Bloop. Ah. There it is.
289,holt,Peralta.
290,holt,"One of our informants just called. We've been tracking a crew that lifts cargo out of Laguardia. The C.I. knows where the trucks unload, so I need you to stake out the drop site."
291,holt,"Well, this is not a negotiation, so go."
292,holt,"Sharon.I have to apologize. I want to assure you that the call to put Sergeant Jeffords back in the field wasn't a spur-of-the-moment, impulse decision. It's been in the works for a few months now."
293,holt,Perhaps I should stop talking to your wife.
294,holt,"I'm sorry, I need to clarify something I said earlier. Sergeant Jeffords was correct when he said that his choice to go back in the field that night was an impulse decision. He didn't even take the time to stop and gear up, so..."
295,holt,"Oh, no. Oh, goodness. I shouldn't have said that. I feel I may have made things worse."
296,holt,"Boyle, let's not make big..."
297,holt,"Oh, good news, Peralta. I found someone from the night shift to relieve you on your stakeout."
298,holt,"Okay, it's your call. All right."
299,holt,Excellent job on the stakeout last night.I'm glad to see you two still work well togetherdespite that ridiculous bet.
300,holt,And I appreciate your turning down the relief team. I'm not sure they could've made that bust.
301,holt,"Okay, what do you got?"
302,holt,"Peralta, give me back my glasses."
303,holt,"All right, lay out the steroids case."
304,holt,"Gentlemen, have a seat. Sergeant Jeffords is just getting back in the field. What if he panics again?"
305,holt,"Okay. It's your case. But if anything goes wrong, it's on you."
306,holt,"Gina, that's terrible. Are you okay?"
307,holt,"Gina, you work in apolice precinct. You can turn to anyone here."
308,holt,They are not buffoons.
309,holt,Some of them are buffoons. But I'll find the non-buffoons to investigate. Could you ask Scully to return my thumbtacks?
310,holt,Good call.
311,holt,No signs of forced entry at the door. But the window was jimmied.
312,holt,"$160 in cash, one TV, one large painting of a naked lady on a lion,one set ofJoseph Gordon-Levittnesting dolls..."
313,holt,One music box that playsshe works hard for the moneywhen opened. One knockoff designer clutch...
314,holt,Why did I just receive a civilian complaint about you two?
315,holt,"Yes, that is it's definition."
316,holt,Leo Sporm.How's business?
317,holt,Everyone knows him.The Picasso of hucksters.
318,holt,Sporm. Out.Now.
319,holt,Detectives.Where are you going?
320,holt,Isn't sergeant Jeffords interrogating the suspect now?
321,holt,Why do you think Gina hired that P.I.?
322,holt,She's scared.
323,holt,"Well, think about how she's been acting."
324,holt,"Her home doesn't feel safe anymore. If someone broke into your apartment and you weren't cops, wouldn't you be scared?"
325,holt,None.
326,holt,It was a hypothetical question.
327,holt,So? How did Sergeant Jeffords do?
328,holt,That does make me happy.
329,holt,Peralta.
330,holt,Do you have a m*rder suspect to question?
331,holt,"You got him, babe. I understood the wordplay, yes."
332,holt,Are those gummy bears wrapped in a fruit roll-up?
333,holt,I pity your dentist.
334,holt,Brief me on the hotel robberies.
335,holt,Keep me updated.
336,holt,Good-bye.
337,holt,"Now I know you'd all prefer to go to a bar, drink beer, and eat chips of various textures. But our CompStat numbers are due tomorrow morning, so I need these arrests on the books today."
338,holt,Dismissed.
339,holt,"I'm worried.The CompStat numbers are due tomorrow at 9:00 A.M., but at this rate, we won't be finished until your daughters are grown and married."
340,holt,Are you saying you want to secretly perform scientific experiments on your friends and coworkers to increase efficiency?
341,holt,"Sounds fun, let's do it."
342,holt,"Good. What's this red area here, the Diaz triangle?"
343,holt,"Mt. Diaz. Humorous, yes."
344,holt,The bathroom.
345,holt,Ca-caw!
346,holt,Ca-caw!
347,holt,"It's good, but we can do better. Tell me about the Boyle-Linetti Reaction."
348,holt,"Well, I really can't blame her on this one. Maybe we should just, uh, empty lost and found."
349,holt,"Oh, my God, we're doomed. Boyle looks like a lesbian."
350,holt,Well done.
351,holt,"I think we should keep going, make the office even more efficient."
352,holt,Are you familiar with the story ofMoneyball?A man uses statistics and logic to win several baseball games. It's my favorite film.
353,holt,The statistical analysis...  It's so beautiful.
354,holt,"This office is becoming a powerhouse of paperwork processing. I'm flying high, Sergeant, and I'm never coming down."
355,holt,"Hello, Peralta."
356,holt,Updates on the case?
357,holt,"Yes, she told me yesterday."
358,holt,"Santiago wants to make Captain one day. I know, because I've frequently caught her wearing my hat and looking into a mirror."
359,holt,"I support her decision. That's what good detectives do. They have each other's back, no matter what."
360,holt,Back to the drawing board.
361,holt,"The problem is, we didn't take Peralta into account. In our next trial--"
362,holt,"Please, I'm open to any ideas about efficiency."
363,holt,"Well, I suppose it's possible we may have been a tad enthusiastic in our pursuit of efficiency..."
364,holt,"Fine, message received. Jeffords and I will get right to work."
365,holt,Get the h*ll out of my chair.
366,holt,Make sure that phrase is not in your official report.
367,holt,"I want you and Santiago to tail Augustine until he makes the drop, and then arrest him and the buyer."
368,holt,That's enough. Peralta and Santiago will tail Augustine. Boyle and Diaz will join them in a surveillance van unless you have a problem with that.
369,holt,"Come in and shut the door. I have some news, which you must promise to keep secret. Madeline Wuntch is making me head of public relations for the NYPD. I'm being forced out of the Nine-Nine. I don't wish to make a big deal of it, so please limit your reactions to one second; go."
370,holt,That's plenty.
371,holt,"I'm not going anywhere. Madeline's not some invincible succubus. She's a regular succubus, and she can be defeated. We just need to find the letter."
372,holt,"Before our current police commissioner was hired, a mutual friend told me Madeline wrote a letter to the mayor telling him it was a mistake. She apparently called her now-boss a ""simpering buffoon""."
373,holt,"A copy of that letter exists in the mayor's archives. I can't go snooping around without alerting Madeline, so it won't be easy, and we don't have much time, but I need you to find that letter. Are you with me?"
374,holt,Well done. Now get me Madeline and a bucket of water. It's time to melt a witch.
375,holt,"Madeline, thank you for coming."
376,holt,Care to sit? I'm sure you'd like to take some weight off your cloven hooves.
377,holt,"Actually I was calling you a goat, you goat."
378,holt,I'd like to talk about my promotion.
379,holt,"Don't count your gross fish babies before they've hatched, Madeline."
380,holt,It doesn't matter how I got it.
381,holt,"Yes, well, who wouldn't want to see a man fight a crocodile? Now, Madeline, before one of us starts weeping like a war widow, would you like to give me my precinct back?"
382,holt,"You have until tomorrow, you grackle."
383,holt,Wuntch.
384,holt,"So nice of you to greet us, Madeline. I thought surely you'd still be crushed under that house in Munchkinland."
385,holt,"Describing your breakfast? I came out as a gay cop in the 1980s, so it's gonna take more than reassigning me to break my spirit. I'll turn this place around just like I did the Nine-Nine."
386,holt,"Thank you, Chief Wuntch. I'm excited to be back. I look forward to doing meaningful work, beginning with my eight-point plan for community engagement."
387,holt,"Oh, no."
388,holt,"I know you've been working on picking a name for the pigeon mascot for, uh, several months now. I feel like you might need a breather, so I've prepared an eight-point presentation on community engagement."
389,holt,"Well, it says here it's scheduled ""after everyone leaves."""
390,holt,Very well. My thoughts are: who cares?
391,holt,No.
392,holt,What does it matter? Why'd you even choose a pigeon anyway? It's a terrible mascot.
393,holt,"They're carriers of disease, and they eat garbage!"
394,holt,You can't make me.
395,holt,...Paulie.
396,holt,"Actually, that's exactly your place to say. You are my assistant. What precisely did you think your job was?"
397,holt,Hmm.
398,holt,"I'd like to propose a truce. Our feud is getting in the way of the NYPD's business. Madeline, the PR department is a joke. Their work here is meaningless. Nine weeks to choose the name Paulie. I knew instantly it should be Pepper, Officer Pepper O'Pigeon."
399,holt,I could turn this department around if you'd let me. You're wasting my talents.
400,holt,"No, Madeline, I don't have my own pigeon pants."
401,holt,"I can't put that pigeon head on, Gina. Wuntch has defeated me. This is how it ends, with me standing on the urine-soaked floor of an elementary school bathroom in a third-rate bird costume. I quit."
402,holt,"I thought your reality show was to be called ""Gina in a Bottle."""
403,holt,Community engagement.
404,holt,Inspiring words. I'm going to give that speech. Help me with that pigeon head.
405,holt,Let's blow some tiny minds.
406,holt,Mm.
407,holt,"Just remember, we're here as PR representatives. I don't wanna be disruptive."
408,holt,I would hate it if these doors opened and everyone stopped working to applaud us.
409,holt,Yes.
410,holt,"Hmm, strange to be on this side of the desk."
411,holt,I'm fairly certain that's a dog.
412,holt,"Sergeant Jeffords, hello."
413,holt,"Well, I won't take up too much of your time. Because the Nine-Nine was Captain Dozerman's last  precinct, you will be seated at the front of the funeral. I wanted to alert you that there'll be press, cameras—"
414,holt,"Oh, I noticed in the bullpen that you had changed the case numbering system. I found, when I was commanding officer, that—"
415,holt,I was making a suggestion.
416,holt,"Yes, well, I know my way out."
417,holt,Yes.
418,holt,"No, I most definitely left."
419,holt,"Let me stop you right there, Peralta. I'm not the Chief of Detectives. I'm not the Vulture's boss. I'm just some guy in PR."
420,holt,"I can't save your ass. I don't work here anymore. And the sooner you accept that, the better."
421,holt,"No. Until this morning, some small part of me still believed I would be captain of the Nine-Nine again. What a fool I was. I should never have returned. It's like visiting your childhood home and seeing it's been replaced by a denim pants store."
422,holt,"I can't. I've been asked to deliver a toast here after the funeral, a message of hope. This is what I have so far: ""Pain."" That's it."
423,holt,"Maybe I will. But first, you're gonna have one drink with me, Sergeant. For old times' sake?"
424,holt,One drink.
425,holt,Everyone I work with is a stupidface. Especially Bryce.
426,holt,Hmm?
427,holt,Hmm?
428,holt,Hmm?
429,holt,"Yes, you already mentioned the yogurt."
430,holt,"But the Vulture told you not to, and you had to listen. He's your captain now, Terry."
431,holt,"Hmm. ""Everything is garbage."" I should put that in my message of hope."
432,holt,And now for a message of hope.
433,holt,Everything is garbage.
434,holt,"You find something you care about, and it's taken from you: your colleague, your dream job, your mango yogurt."
435,holt,Never love anything. That's the lesson. To Captain Dozerman.
436,holt,I have one. Holt saves your ass.
437,holt,"I was moved by your speech, Peralta."
438,holt,The syntax was problematic.
439,holt,And your vocabulary is a true indictment of the public school system.
440,holt,"But the fact that you're not willing to give up in the face of adversity is inspiring. I love the Nine-Nine, and I'm not gonna turn my back on the squad. So I fixed your problem with the Vulture."
441,holt,I may just be a guy in PR. But what does the Vulture love more than anything?
442,holt,No. Publicity.
443,holt,"Captain Pembroke, how would you like your face on the NYPD website?"
444,holt,"In exchange for media attention, the Vulture will not bust you down or stand in the way of you two dating."
445,holt,Anything for the Nine-Nine.
446,holt,"Santiago, thank you for coming in. It's no secret the NYPD has an image problem."
447,holt,"Police approval ratings are, pardon my language, in the commode. All the headlines are about the bad cops, but there are good cops too, and I want to put up posters that showcase some of our best. I'd like you to be on the first one."
448,holt,"I think this campaign is very promising. Santiago, what's your take?"
449,holt,"I didn't ask you, and you're not a police officer."
450,holt,"Look strong, but fair. But approachable. But professional. And fun. But not too fun. This is your job. Can you handle all that?"
451,holt,Did you win?
452,holt,"That's enough, Gina."
453,holt,"And all I'm saying as a, if not the, boss here is, if you're not gonna support me, you can leave."
454,holt,"Well, you must feel like a celebrity. A regular Ira Glass."
455,holt,"Yes, this is unfortunate, but let's not overreact to one graffito."
456,holt,This is easily dealt with. I'll just issue a statement saying vandals will be prosecuted.
457,holt,I see.
458,holt,"Hmm. I'm surprised she hasn't marched in here to say ""I told you so."""
459,holt,Yes.
460,holt,"Gina, as you predicted, there was some backlash to the poster campaign."
461,holt,"I think a problem the police have had is our inability to admit our mistakes, so this campaign was, um...a mistake. You told me that, but I got defensive and didn't listen. I should have been open to criticism, as this department should be open to criticism. That's why I'm replacing these with...these. My email address is at the bottom, and I intend to respond to every message I receive. Before we put them up, I want to hear your thoughts."
462,holt,For whom?
463,holt,"Look, Gina, is that a talking raisin?"
464,holt,"The task force? Oh, I thought you'd be handing me another vapid PR assignment."
465,holt,But I'm his boss.
466,holt,What's going on?
467,holt,"Yes, yours is an idiot, and mine is a fork-tongued lizard witch. The Oolong Slayer. He's back."
468,holt,What's your plan?
469,holt,Wrong. We're gonna work the case in secret.
470,holt,"No one can know about this, understood?"
471,holt,"If I recall correctly, the Oolong Slayer last struck five years ago. He left behind no DNA or fingerprints, but he did leave his calling card, a tea bag in his victim's mouth."
472,holt,"Very cool—I mean, awful. What's our strategy?"
473,holt,Let's not overlook the fact that he turned his crime scenes into tea parties for dollies.
474,holt,"You look into the B&Es and I'll check out the juvie angle. Now, before we begin in earnest, I'd like to propose a toast."
475,holt,A 25-year-old port seems appropriate.
476,holt,To catching a serial killer.
477,holt,I'll take your word for it. The juvie angle didn't pan out.
478,holt,"Good work, Peralta."
479,holt,We create a diversion while Gina copies his customer files.
480,holt,"Let's do this. Oh, hey, pal, that's my ginkgo."
481,holt,I'm still young enough to beat that ginkgo out of your hands.
482,holt,"Partner. Not many people buy that tea, and only one has been doing so since the killings first began, and he has a record. His name? Braxton O'Reilly."
483,holt,Still counts. Let's get that psycho.
484,holt,Where is Braxton O'Reilly? Where is that psycho monster?
485,holt,Our condolences.
486,holt,"It was an error, but—"
487,holt,"I don't know why you insisted on eating here, Gina. It seems like your average greasy spoon."
488,holt,"Peralta, what are you doing here?"
489,holt,"No, no, we can't be seen together. Gina, did you know about this?"
490,holt,"Are you insane? We were just suspended for screwing up this case. I shouldn't even be talking to you. Wuntch can probably hear us right now. She has super sonar hearing, because she's a bat."
491,holt,"That's your dream. Mine was to run the Nine-Nine, and that will never happen again. Just give the case to Major Crimes."
492,holt,Am I invited? Drop the weapon.
493,holt,"Now say ""punk."""
494,holt,Punk!
495,holt,"Thank you, Peralta."
496,holt,"No, for giving me one last chance to be a real cop before going back to a lifetime of PR drivel."
497,holt,That's troubling.
498,holt,"No, no. I think you should take sole credit. Wuntch will only use it to sink me. I'm glad your dream came true, Peralta. Now, if you'll excuse me, the drivel calls."
499,holt,"Hello, squad."
500,holt,"Good news. The Vulture is out, and I'm back."
501,holt,I didn't. I guess someone just had my back.
502,holt,She wanted to make a proper entrance.
503,holt,"Good morning, Boyle. It's Halloween; I'm surprised you didn't put on a costume."
504,holt,Does it matter if I say no?
505,holt,"Squad, that's enough. You're making Boyle feel bad on purpose. He's Elvis."
506,holt,"Elvis Stojko, the Canadian figure skater."
507,holt,I never agreed to that.
508,holt,"The first year, by sheer, dumb luck, Jake eked out a feeble victory."
509,holt,Sad because the competition was so dismal.
510,holt,"This year's the tie-breaker, a final heist to decide once and for all the true king of the Nine-Nine."
511,holt,"This year, we both attempt to steal the same object, instead of Jake attempting to steal one from me."
512,holt,";The crown will be locked in this briefcase, which in turn will be locked in the interrogation room."
513,holt,"With the first pick of the draft, I choose Terry."
514,holt,I pick Gina.
515,holt,"Hang on, Santiago. I'm not sure I can trust you. You're Peralta's... paramour. Maybe you should be on his team."
516,holt,"Yeah, Amy's out. By midnight, whoever has the crown will be the king of the Nine-Nine."
517,holt,I'm good.
518,holt,"Yes, I'm the fool. You fool."
519,holt,"Sergeant, are you familiar with the Hungarian fencing term, Hosszú Gorcs?"
520,holt,"It's a strategy of letting your opponent win points early to give them a sense of overconfidence, thus exposing a much easier target for you later."
521,holt,"Of course. Jeffords, we'll rendezvous later."
522,holt,"Well, that's an intriguing proposition. You certainly could be useful—"
523,holt,"To Jake! I got you, Peralta! You're not fooling anyone!"
524,holt,"Because the cleavage cloaks the camera with its curves. That will be all, spy. Sorry I said cleavage."
525,holt,"It's go time, Sergeant."
526,holt,And...Ding.
527,holt,Time for the twin twist.
528,holt,"Nothing—just enjoying a taste of my favorite beverage, the soda pop."
529,holt,Hmm.
530,holt,Ahh. It's delicious.
531,holt,"Why would I have the crown, Jake? Isn't it still in the interrogation room?"
532,holt,"No, after you."
533,holt,"It was the worst thing in the world—worse than a fruit-forward Riesling. No, I'm not exaggerating. Anyhow, I cleverly ditched the crown in a trash can. Wait a minute so as to not arouse suspicion and then retrieve it."
534,holt,"I know you're joking, but on the off chance you aren't—No."
535,holt,Damn it. That son of a bitch is good.
536,holt,"Hello, Peralta."
537,holt,Midnight nears.
538,holt,Tick tock indeed.
539,holt,"You know it's ""for whom."" Don't try to provoke me."
540,holt,Wait—what?
541,holt,"Yes, I too need to be excused."
542,holt,I don't know who has it.
543,holt,"Oh, Santiago. There's my protégé."
544,holt,Janitor? Address? Al?
545,holt,I wouldn't have it any other way. You are my wisest detective.
546,holt,Love? Ha. What's love compared to the respect of a workplace superior?
547,holt,We should apologize.
548,holt,Fat chance.
549,holt,"Alpha Team, this is the Golden Sparrow. Rendezvous at Drop Zone Yankee."
550,holt,Or did you?
551,holt,"Of course we're looking for Al, you imbecile! Sorry."
552,holt,Al? Al? Where's Al?
553,holt,Good God. Are you Al the janitor?
554,holt,I don't understand what is happening.
555,holt,What?
556,holt,And I threw the crown in the trash can.
557,holt,Gladly.
558,holt,Drinks are on us.
559,holt,Drinks are on me.
560,holt,Just call the U.S. marshal who handles our case. She'll explain everything.
561,holt,Tell that to the Dutch Hookbill.
562,holt,And how do you propose to pull that off?
563,holt,I'm Raymond. I don't care for baseball.
564,holt,I don't think Evan gets what we're doing here.
565,holt,Jake!
566,holt,Ah!
567,holt,Why isn't he coming in?
568,holt,What would it take for him to intervene? Do I actually have to kill you?
569,holt,Ugh!
570,holt,I think so.
571,holt,"It's 2016, man. This is on you."
572,holt,There's nothing false about it. We committed several felonies and escaped from jail.
573,holt,"Figgis is in town, and we have no car, no money, no guns; we can't go back to our houses because the police are looking for us."
574,holt,Absolutely not.
575,holt,"Nothing, I just think that we can do it alone."
576,holt,"All right. The Nine-Nine bailed me out once before when I was taken hostage by Bob, a man I had put my trust in, like a fool. I don't want them to rescue me again. It's embarrassing. I need to clean up my own mess."
